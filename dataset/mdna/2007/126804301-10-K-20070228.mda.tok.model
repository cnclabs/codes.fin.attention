government regulation regulation of our bank subsidiary 
our wholly owned bank subsidiary is a nebraska state chartered bank with deposits insured by the bank insurance fund of the federal deposit insurance corporation  or the fdic 
our bank subsidiary is subject to comprehensive regulation and periodic examination by the nebraska department of banking and finance  or ndbf  and the fdic 
we also are registered as a bank holding company with the ndbf and as such are subject to periodic examination by the ndbf 
our bank subsidiary does not qualify as a bank under the bank holding company act of  as amended  or the bhca  because it is in compliance with a credit card bank exemption from the bhca 
if it failed to meet the credit card bank exemption criteria  its status as an insured depository institution would make us subject to the provisions of the bhca  including restrictions as to the types of business activities in which a bank holding company and its affiliates may engage 
we could be required to either divest our bank subsidiary or divest or cease any activities not permissible for a bank holding company and its affiliates  including our direct and retail businesses 
while the consequences of being subject to regulation under the bhca would be severe  we believe that the risk of being subject to the bhca is minimal as a result of the precautions we have taken in structuring our business 
there are various federal and nebraska law regulations relating to minimum regulatory capital requirements and requirements concerning the payment of dividends from net profits or surplus  restrictions governing transactions between an insured depository institution and its affiliates  and general federal and nebraska regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices 
at the end of  our bank subsidiary met the requirements for a well capitalized institution  the highest of the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act s fdicia five capital ratio levels 
a well capitalized classification should not necessarily be viewed as describing the condition or future prospects of a depository institution  including our bank subsidiary 
fdicia also requires the fdic to implement a system of risk based premiums for deposit insurance pursuant to which the premiums paid by a depository institution will be based on the probability that the fdic will incur a loss in respect of that institution 
the fdic has since adopted a system that imposes insurance premiums based upon a matrix that takes into account an institution s capital level and supervisory rating 
subject to certain limitations  federal bank agencies may also require banking organizations such as our bank subsidiary to hold regulatory capital against the full risk weighted amount of its retained securitization interests 
we understand that these federal bank agencies continue to analyze interests in securitization transactions under their rules to determine the appropriate capital treatment 
any such determination could require our bank subsidiary to hold significantly higher levels of regulatory capital against such interests 
the activities of our bank subsidiary as a consumer lender also are subject to regulation under the various federal laws  including the truth in lending act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair credit reporting act  the usa patriot act  the fair and accurate credit transactions act of  the community reinvestment act  the service members civil relief act and the gramm leach bliley act glb  as well as various state laws 
the truth in lending act requires disclosure of the finance charge and the annual percentage rate and certain costs and terms of credit 
the equal credit opportunity act prohibits discrimination against an applicant for credit because of age  sex  marital status  religion  race  color  national origin or receipt of public assistance 
the fair credit reporting act establishes procedures for correcting mistakes in a person s credit record and generally requires that the records be kept confidential 
the usa patriot act  among other things  regulates money laundering and prohibits structuring financial transactions to evade reporting requirements 
the community reinvestment act requires federal agencies to encourage depository financial institutions to help meet the credit needs of their communities 
the service members civil relief act provides for temporary suspension of legal proceedings and financial transactions that may adversely affect the civil rights of service members during military service 
we spend significant amounts of time ensuring we are in compliance with these laws and work with our service providers to ensure that actions they take in connection with services they perform for us are in compliance with these laws 
depending on the underlying issue and applicable law  regulators are often authorized to impose penalties for violations of these statutes and  in some cases  to order our bank subsidiary to compensate injured borrowers 
borrowers may also have a private right of action to bring actions for some violations 
federal bankruptcy and state debtor relief and collection laws also affect the ability of our bank subsidiary to collect outstanding balances owed by borrowers 
the glb act requires our bank subsidiary to disclose its privacy policy to customers and consumers  and requires that such customers and consumers be given a choice through an opt out notice to forbid the sharing of non public personal information about them with non affiliated third persons 
we have a written privacy notice posted on our website which is delivered to each of our customers when the customer relationships begin  and annually thereafter  in compliance with the glb act 
taxation applicable to us 
we pay applicable corporate income  franchise and other taxes  to states in which our destination retail stores are physically located 
upon entering a new state  we apply for a private letter ruling from the state s revenue department stating which types of taxes our direct and retail businesses will be required to collect and pay in such state  and we accrue and remit the applicable taxes based upon the private letter ruling 
as we open more destination retail stores  we will be subject to tax in an increasing number of state and local taxing jurisdictions 
although we believe we have properly accrued for these taxes based on our current interpretation of the tax code and prior private letter rulings  state taxing authorities may challenge our interpretation  attempt to revoke their private letter rulings or amend their tax laws 
if state taxing authorities are successful  additional taxes  interest and related penalties may be assessed 
see risk factors our use tax collection policy for our direct business may subject us to liabilities for unpaid use taxes on past sales and our destination retail store expansion strategy may result in our direct business establishing nexus with additional states which may cause our direct business to pay additional income and use taxes and have an adverse effect on the profitability and cash flows of our direct business 
other regulations applicable to us 
we must comply with federal  state and local regulations  including the federal brady handgun violence prevention act  which require us  as a federal firearms licensee  to perform a pre sale background check of purchasers of hunting rifles and other firearms 
we also are subject to a variety of state laws and regulations relating to  among other things  advertising  pricing  and product safety restrictions 
some of these laws prohibit or limit the sale  in certain states and locations  of certain items we offer such as black powder firearms  ammunition  bows  knives and similar products 
state and local government regulation of hunting can also affect our business 
we are subject to certain federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety 
we believe that we are in substantial compliance with the terms of environmental laws and that we have no liabilities under such laws that we expect to have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our direct business is subject to the mail or telephone order merchandise rule and related regulations promulgated by the federal trade commission  or ftc  which affect our catalog mail order operations 
ftc regulations  in general  govern the solicitation of orders  the information provided to prospective customers and the timeliness of shipments and refunds 
in addition  the ftc has established guidelines for advertising and labeling many of the products we sell

risk factors risk factors risks related to our merchandising business if we cannot successfully implement our destination retail store expansion strategy  our growth and profitability would be adversely impacted 
since january   we have increased the number of our destination retail stores from two  totaling  square feet  to  totaling million square feet 
we currently plan to open eight additional destination retail stores by the end of we continue to actively seek additional locations to open new destination retail stores 
our ability to open new destination retail stores in a timely manner and operate them profitably depends on a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control  including our ability to manage the financial and operational aspects of our retail growth strategy  our ability to identify suitable locations  including our ability to gather and assess demographic and marketing data to determine consumer demand for our products in the locations we select  our ability to negotiate and obtain economic development packages with local and state governments where our new destination retail stores would be located  our ability to properly assess the implications of economic development packages and customer density to project the profitability of potential new destination retail store locations  our ability to secure required governmental permits and approvals  our ability to hire and train skilled store operating personnel  especially management personnel  the availability of construction materials and labor and the absence of significant construction delays or cost overruns  our ability to provide a satisfactory mix of merchandise that is responsive to the needs of our customers living in the areas where new destination retail stores are built  our ability to supply new destination retail stores with inventory in a timely manner  our ability to properly assess operational and regulatory challenges involved in opening and successfully operating destination retail stores in canada  our competitors building or leasing stores near our destination retail stores or in locations we have identified as targets for a new destination retail store  general economic and business conditions affecting consumer confidence and spending and the overall strength of our business  and the availability of financing on favorable terms 
we may not be able to sustain the growth in the number of our destination retail stores  the revenue growth historically achieved by our destination retail stores or to maintain consistent levels of profitability in our retail business  particularly as we expand into markets now served by other large format sporting goods retailers and mass merchandisers 
in particular  new destination retail stores typically generate lower operating margins because pre opening costs are fully expensed in the year of opening and because fixed costs  as a percentage of revenue  are higher 
in addition  the substantial management time and resources which our destination retail store expansion strategy requires may result in disruption to our existing business operations which may harm our profitability 
our continued retail expansion will result in a higher number of destination retail stores  which could adversely affect the desirability of our destination retail stores  harm the operating results of our retail business and reduce the revenue of our direct business 
as the number of our destination retail stores increases  our stores will become more highly concentrated in the geographic regions we serve 
as a result  the number of customers and related revenue at individual stores may decline and the average amount of sales per square foot at our stores may be reduced 
in addition  as we open more destination retail stores and as our competitors open stores with similar formats  our destination retail store format may become less unique and may be less attractive to customers as tourist and entertainment shopping locations 
if either of these events occurs  the operating results of our retail business could be adversely affected 
the growth in the number of our destination retail stores may also draw customers away from our direct business 
if we are unable to properly manage the relationship between our direct business and our retail business  the revenue of our direct business could be adversely affected 
our failure to successfully manage our direct business could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
during fiscal  our direct business accounted for of the total revenue in our direct and retail businesses 
our direct business is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond our control  including the following our inability to properly adjust the fixed costs of a catalog mailing to reflect subsequent sales of the products marketed in the catalog  lower and less predictable response rates for catalogs sent to prospective customers  increases in us postal service rates  paper costs and printing costs resulting in higher catalog production costs and lower profits for our direct business  failures to properly design  print and mail our catalogs in a timely manner  failures to introduce new catalog titles  failures to timely fill customer orders  changes in consumer preferences  willingness to purchase goods through catalogs or the internet  weak economic conditions and economic uncertainty  and unseasonable weather in key geographic markets  increases in software filters that may inhibit our ability to market our products through e mail messages to our customers and increases in consumer privacy concerns relating to the internet  changes in applicable federal and state regulation  such as the federal trade commission act  the children s online privacy act  the fair credit reporting act and the gramm leach bliley act  breaches of internet security  and failures in our internet infrastructure or the failure of systems of third parties  such as telephone or electric power service  resulting in website downtime  customer care center closures or other problems 
any one or more of these factors could result in lower than expected revenue for our direct business 
these factors could also result in increased costs  increased merchandise returns  slower turning inventories  inventory write downs and working capital constraints 
because our direct business accounts for a significant portion of our total revenue  any performance shortcomings experienced by our direct business would likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results and cash flows 
competition in the outdoor recreation and casual apparel and footwear markets could reduce our revenue and profitability 
the outdoor recreation and casual apparel and footwear markets are highly fragmented and competitive 
we compete directly or indirectly with the following categories of companies other specialty retailers that compete with us across a significant portion of our merchandising categories through direct or retail businesses  such as bass pro shops  gander mountain  orvis  the sportsman s guide and sportsman s warehouse  large format sporting goods stores and chains  such as the sports authority  dick s sporting goods and big sporting goods  retailers that currently compete with us through retail businesses that may enter the direct business  mass merchandisers  warehouse clubs  discount stores and department stores  such as wal mart and target  and casual outdoor apparel and footwear retailers  such as ll bean  land s end and rei 
many of our competitors have a larger number of stores  and some of them have substantially greater market presence  name recognition and financial  distribution  marketing and other resources than we have 
in addition  if our competitors reduce their prices  we may have to reduce our prices in order to compete 
furthermore  some of our competitors have been aggressively building new stores in locations with high concentrations of our direct business customers 
as a result of this competition  we may need to spend more on advertising and promotion 
some of our mass merchandising competitors  such as wal mart  do not currently compete in many of the product lines we offer 
if these competitors were to begin offering a broader array of competing products  or if any of the other factors listed above occurred  our revenue could be reduced or our costs could be increased  resulting in reduced profitability 
if we fail to maintain the strength and value of our brand  our revenue is likely to decline 
our success depends on the value and strength of the cabela s brand 
the cabela s name is integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business 
maintaining  promoting and positioning our brand will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide high quality merchandise and a consistent  high quality customer experience 
our brand could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity 
any of these events could result in decreases in revenue 
we are implementing substantial systems changes in support of our direct business and destination retail store expansion that might disrupt our supply chain operations 
our success depends on our ability to source merchandise efficiently through appropriate management information and operational systems and procedures 
we regularly evaluate our information technology systems and are implementing modifications to our technology that will involve updating or replacing our systems with successor systems during the course of several years  including changes to our merchandising systems and improvements to our customer relationship management system 
there are inherent risks associated with replacing or modifying these systems  including supply chain disruptions that could affect our ability to deliver products to our stores and our customers in an efficient manner 
in addition  in updating and replacing our systems  we may be unable to accurately capture and transfer data 
we may be unable to successfully launch these new systems  the launch of these new systems could result in supply chain disruptions or the actual cost may exceed the estimated cost of these new systems  any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  there is no assurance that successfully implemented new systems will deliver value to us 
we depend on vendors and service providers to operate our business and any disruption of their supply of products and services could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 
we depend on a number of vendors and service providers to operate our business  including vendors to supply our merchandise in sufficient quantities at competitive prices in a timely manner  outside printers and catalog production vendors to print and mail our catalogs and to convert our catalogs to digital format for website posting  shipping companies  such as united parcel service  the us postal service and common carriers  for timely delivery of our catalogs  shipment of merchandise to our customers and delivery of merchandise from our vendors to us and from our distribution centers to our destination retail stores  telephone companies to provide telephone service to our in house customer care centers  communications providers to provide our internet users with access to our website and a website hosting service provider to host and manage our website  and software providers to provide software and related services to run our operating systems for our direct and retail businesses 
any disruption in these services could have a negative impact on our ability to market and sell our products  and serve our customers 
our ten largest vendors collectively represented of our total purchases in fiscal if we are unable to acquire suitable merchandise or lose one or more key vendors  we may not be able to offer products that are important to our merchandise assortment 
we also are subject to risks  such as the unavailability of raw materials  labor disputes  union organizing activity  strikes  inclement weather  natural disasters  war and terrorism  and adverse general economic and political conditions that might limit our vendors ability to provide us with quality merchandise on a timely basis 
we have no contractual arrangements providing for continued supply from our key vendors and our vendors may discontinue selling to us at any time 
we may not be able to develop relationships with new vendors  and products from alternative sources  if any  may be of a lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently purchase 
any delay or failure in offering products to our customers could have an adverse impact on our revenue and profitability 
in addition  if the cost of fuel rises  the cost to deliver merchandise to the customers of our direct business and from our distribution centers to our destination retail stores may rise which could have an adverse impact on our profitability 
political and economic uncertainty and unrest in foreign countries where our vendors are located could adversely affect our operating results 
in fiscal  approximately of our merchandise was obtained directly from vendors located in foreign countries  with approximately of our merchandise being obtained from vendors located in china  mexico  taiwan  japan and viet nam 
in addition  we believe that a significant portion of our other vendors obtain their products from foreign countries that may also be subject to political and economic uncertainty 
we are subject to risks and uncertainties associated with changing economic and political conditions in foreign countries where our vendors are located  such as increased import duties  tariffs  trade restrictions and quotas  work stoppages  economic uncertainties including inflation  adverse foreign government regulations  wars  fears of war and terrorist attacks and organizing activities  adverse fluctuations of foreign currencies  and political unrest 
we cannot predict when  or the extent to which  the countries in which our products are manufactured will experience any of the above events 
any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from foreign locations would likely increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us and would adversely affect our operating results  particularly if imports of our cabela s branded merchandise were adversely affected as our margins are higher on our cabela s branded merchandise 
our ability to source our merchandise profitably or at all could be hurt if new trade restrictions are imposed or existing trade restrictions become more burdensome 
trade restrictions  including increased tariffs  safeguards or quotas  on apparel and accessories could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us 
under the world trade organization wto agreement  effective january   the united states and other wto member countries removed quotas on goods from wto members  which in certain instances affords us greater flexibility in importing textile and apparel products from wto countries from which we source our merchandise 
however  as the removal of quotas resulted in an import surge from china  the united states in may imposed safeguard quotas on seven categories of goods and apparel imported from china 
effective january   the united states imposed quotas on approximately twelve categories of goods and apparel from china  and may impose additional quotas in the future 
these and other trade restrictions could have a significant impact on our sourcing patterns in the future 
trade restrictions  including increased tariffs or quotas  embargoes  safeguards and customs restrictions against apparel items  as well as us or foreign labor strikes  work stoppages or boycotts could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices  any of which could hurt our profitability 
due to the seasonality of our business  our annual operating results would be adversely affected if our revenue during the third and fourth fiscal quarters were substantially below expectations 
we experience seasonal fluctuations in our revenue and operating results 
historically  we have realized a significant portion of our revenue and substantially all of our earnings for the year during the third and fourth fiscal quarters  with a majority of the revenue and earnings for these quarters realized in the fourth fiscal quarter 
in fiscal  we generated and of our revenue  and and of our net income  in the third and fourth fiscal quarters  respectively 
we incur significant additional expenses in the third and fourth fiscal quarters due to higher customer purchase volumes and increased staffing 
if we miscalculate the demand for our products generally or for our product mix during these two quarters  our revenue could decline  which would harm our financial performance 
in addition  abnormally warm weather conditions during the third and fourth fiscal quarters can reduce sales of many of the products normally sold during this time period and inclement weather can reduce store traffic or cause us to temporarily close stores causing a reduction in revenue 
because a substantial portion of our operating income is derived from our third and fourth fiscal quarter revenue  a shortfall in expected third and fourth fiscal quarter revenue would cause our annual operating results to suffer significantly 
a decline in discretionary consumer spending could reduce our revenue 
our revenue depends on discretionary consumer spending  which may decrease due to a variety of factors beyond our control  including unfavorable general business conditions  increases in interest rates  increases in inflation  wars  fears of war and terrorist attacks and organizing activities  increases in consumer debt levels and decreases in the availability of consumer credit  adverse or unseasonable weather conditions or events  increases in gasoline prices reducing the willingness to travel to our destination retail stores  adverse changes in applicable laws and regulations  increases in taxation  adverse unemployment trends  and other factors that adversely influence consumer confidence and spending 
our customers purchases of discretionary items  including our products  could decline during periods when disposable income is lower or periods of actual or perceived unfavorable economic conditions 
if this occurs  our revenue would decline 
if we lose key management or are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business  our operating results could suffer 
our future success depends to a significant degree on the skills  experience and efforts of dennis highby  our president and chief executive officer  and other key personnel including our senior executive management and merchandising teams 
with the exception of our chairman  richard n 
cabela  and our vice chairman  james w 
cabela  none of our senior management or directors has employment agreements other than our management change of control severance agreements 
we do not carry key man life insurance on any of our executives or key management personnel 
in addition  our corporate headquarters is located in a sparsely populated rural area which may make it difficult to attract and retain qualified individuals for key management positions 
the loss of the services of any of these individuals or the inability to attract and retain qualified individuals for our key management positions could cause our operating results to suffer 
our business depends on our ability to meet our labor needs  and if we are unable to do so  our destination retail store expansion strategy may be delayed and our revenue growth may suffer 
our success depends on hiring  training  managing and retaining quality managers  sales associates and employees in our destination retail stores and customer care centers 
our corporate headquarters  distribution centers  return center and some of our destination retail stores are located in sparsely populated rural areas 
it may be difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel  especially management and technical personnel  in these areas 
competition for qualified management and technical employees could require us to pay higher wages or grant above market levels of stock compensation to attract a sufficient number of employees 
if we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel as needed  the implementation of our destination retail store expansion strategy may be delayed and our revenue growth may suffer 
our use tax collection policy for our direct business may subject us to liabilities for unpaid use taxes on past sales 
many states have attempted to require that out of state direct marketers  whose only contacts with the state are solicitations and delivery to their residents of products purchased through the mail or the internet  collect use taxes on the sale of these products 
in addition  a private litigant  purportedly on behalf of various states  has initiated litigation against several out of state direct marketers alleging that the failure to collect and remit use tax violates various state false claims laws 
the us supreme court has held that states  absent congressional legislation  may not impose tax collection obligations on out of state direct marketers unless the out of state direct marketer has nexus with the state 
nexus generally is created by the physical presence of the direct marketer  its agents or its property within the state 
our use tax collection policy for our direct business is to collect and remit use tax in states where our direct business has established nexus 
prior to the opening of a destination retail store  we have historically sought a private letter ruling from the state in which the store will be located as to whether our direct business will have nexus with that state as a result of the store opening 
some states have enacted legislation that requires use tax collection by direct marketers with no physical presence in that state 
in some instances  the legislation assumes nexus exists because of the physical presence of an affiliated entity engaged in the same line of business 
we have received a use tax assessment from a state 
in addition  a competitor has commenced an action against us in another state  alleging that our failure to collect and remit use tax in certain states constitutes unfair competition 
we presently intend to vigorously contest the assessment and the action  but we may not prevail 
if we do not prevail  we could be held liable for use taxes on prior direct business sales which could be substantial 
our destination retail store expansion strategy may result in our direct business establishing nexus with additional states which may cause our direct business to pay additional income and use taxes and have an adverse effect on the profitability and cash flows of our direct business 
as we open destination retail stores in additional states  the relationship between the retail stores and the direct business may be deemed by state tax authorities to create nexus for state income and use taxation of our direct business in these states 
in addition  our direct business may establish or be deemed to have established nexus in states where we have previously opened destination retail stores and in states where competitors have not established nexus 
the establishment of nexus and imposition of use taxes by states on sales of our direct business could create administrative burdens for us  increase the tax collection and payment obligations of our direct business  increase the total cost of our products to our customers relative to our competitors that do not collect use taxes  and decrease the sales of our direct business or cause us to reduce the underlying prices for the products sold through our direct business 
these events could have an adverse effect on the profitability and cash flows of our direct business 
we must successfully order and manage our inventory to reflect customer demand and anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends or our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected 
our success depends upon our ability to successfully manage our inventory and to anticipate and respond to merchandise trends and customer demands in a timely manner 
we cannot predict consumer preferences with certainty and they may change over time 
we usually must order merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season 
the extended lead times for many of our purchases may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or changes in prices 
if we misjudge either the market for our merchandise or our customers purchasing habits  our revenue may decline significantly and we may not have sufficient quantities of merchandise to satisfy customer demand or we may be required to mark down excess inventory  either of which would result in lower profit margins 
in addition  as we implement our destination retail store expansion strategy  we will need to construct additional distribution centers or expand the size of our existing distribution centers to support our growing number of destination retail stores 
if we are unable to find suitable locations for new distribution centers or to timely integrate new or expanded distribution centers into our inventory control process  we may not be able to deliver inventory to our destination retail stores in a timely manner  which could have an adverse effect on the revenue and cash flows of our retail business 
a natural disaster or other disruption at our distribution centers or return facility could cause us to lose merchandise and be unable to effectively deliver to our direct customers and destination retail stores 
we currently rely on distribution centers in sidney  nebraska  mitchell  south dakota  prairie du chien  wisconsin and wheeling  west virginia to handle our distribution needs 
we operate a return center in oshkosh  nebraska  and our wheeling  west virginia distribution center also processes returns 
any natural disaster or other serious disruption to these centers due to fire  tornado or any other calamity could damage a significant portion of our inventory  and materially impair our ability to adequately stock our destination retail stores  deliver merchandise to customers and process returns to vendors and could result in lost revenue  increased costs and reduced profits 
our failure to obtain or negotiate economic development packages with local and state governments could cause us to significantly alter our destination retail store strategy or format and or delay the construction of one or more of our destination retail stores and could adversely affect our revenue  cash flows and profitability 
we have received economic development packages from many of the local and state governments where our destination retail stores are located 
in some locations  we have experienced an increased amount of government and citizen resistance and critical review of pending and existing economic development packages 
this resistance and critical review may cause local and state government officials in future locations to deny or limit economic development packages that might otherwise be available to us 
the failure to obtain similar economic development packages in the future for any of these reasons could cause us to significantly alter our destination retail store strategy or format 
as a result  we could be forced to invest less capital in our stores which could have an adverse effect on our ability to construct the stores as attractive tourist and entertainment shopping destinations  possibly leading to a decrease in revenue or revenue growth 
in addition  the failure to obtain similar economic development packages for stores built in the future would have an adverse impact on our cash flows and on the return on investment in these stores 
the failure of properties to generate sufficient taxes to amortize economic development bonds owned by us that relate to the development of such properties would have an adverse impact on our cash flows and profitability 
we often purchase economic development bonds issued by state or local governmental entities in connection with the development of our destination retail stores 
the proceeds of these bonds are then used to fund the construction and equipping of new destination retail stores and related infrastructure development 
the repayments of principal and interest on these bonds are typically tied to sales  property or lodging taxes generated from the related destination retail store and  in some cases  from other businesses in the surrounding area  over periods which range between and years 
however  the governmental entity from which we purchase the bonds is not otherwise liable for repayment of principal and interest on the bonds to the extent that the associated taxes are insufficient to pay the bonds 
at the time we purchase these bonds  we make estimates of the discounted future cash flow streams they are expected to generate in the form of interest and principal payments 
because these cash flows are based primarily on future property or sales tax collections at our destination retail stores and other facilities which in many cases may not be operating at the time we make our estimates  these estimates are inherently subjective and the probability of ultimate realization is highly uncertain 
if sufficient tax revenue is not generated by the subject properties  we will not receive the full amount of the expected payments due under the bonds  which would have an adverse impact on our cash flows and profitability 
our failure to comply with the terms of current economic development agreements could result in our repayment of grant money or other adverse consequences that would affect our cash flows and profitability 
the economic development packages which we have received in connection with the construction of our current stores have  in some instances  contained forfeiture provisions and other remedies in the event we do not fully comply with the terms of the economic development agreements 
among the terms which could trigger these remedies are the failure to maintain certain employment and wage levels  failure to timely open and operate a destination retail store and failure to develop property adjacent to a destination retail store 
as of the end of fiscal  the total amount of grant funding subject to repayment pursuant to a specific contractual remedy was million 
other remedies that have been included in some economic development agreements are loss of priority to tax payments supporting the repayment of bonds held by us 
where specific remedies are not set forth  the local governments would be entitled to pursue general contract remedies 
a default by us under these economic development agreements could have an adverse effect on our cash flows and profitability 
we may incur costs from litigation or increased regulation relating to products that we sell  particularly tree stands and firearms  which could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
we may incur damages due to lawsuits relating to products we sell 
we are currently a defendant in eight product liability lawsuits  including five lawsuits relating to tree stands 
tree stands are seating platforms used by hunters to elevate themselves in a tree 
in addition  sales of firearms and ammunition represented approximately of our merchandise revenue during fiscal we may incur losses due to lawsuits  including potential class actions  relating to our performance of background checks on firearms purchases and compliance with other sales laws as mandated by state and federal law 
we may also incur losses from lawsuits relating to the improper use of firearms or ammunition sold by us  including lawsuits by municipalities or other organizations attempting to recover costs from manufacturers and retailers of firearms and ammunition 
our insurance coverage and the insurance provided by our vendors for certain products they sell to us may be inadequate to cover claims and liabilities related to products that we sell 
in addition  claims or lawsuits related to products that we sell or the unavailability of insurance for product liability claims  could result in the elimination of these products from our product line reducing revenue 
if one or more successful claims against us are not covered by or exceed our insurance coverage  or if insurance coverage is no longer available  our available working capital may be impaired and our operating results could be adversely affected 
even unsuccessful claims could result in the expenditure of funds and management time and could have a negative impact on our profitability and on future premiums we would be required to pay on our insurance policies 
current and future government regulation may negatively impact demand for our products and our ability to conduct our business 
federal  state and local laws and regulations can affect our business and the demand for products 
these laws and regulations include federal trade commission regulations governing the manner in which orders may be solicited and prescribing other obligations in fulfilling orders and consummating sales  laws and regulations that prohibit or limit the sale  in certain states and localities  of certain items we offer such as firearms  black powder firearms  ammunition  bows  knives and similar products  the bureau of alcohol  tobacco  firearms and explosives governing the manner in which we sell firearms and ammunition  laws and regulations governing hunting and fishing  laws and regulations relating to the collecting and sharing of non public customer information  and us customs laws and regulations pertaining to proper item classification  quotas  payment of duties and tariffs  and maintenance of documentation and internal control programs which relate to importing taxidermy which we display in our destination retail stores 
changes in these laws and regulations or additional regulation could cause the demand for and sales of our products to decrease 
moreover  complying with increased or changed regulations could cause our operating expenses to increase 
this could adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
our inability or failure to protect our intellectual property could have a negative impact on our operating results 
our trademarks  service marks  copyrights  patents  trade secrets  domain names and other intellectual property are valuable assets that are critical to our success 
effective trademark and other intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which our products are made available 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our intellectual property could diminish the value of our brands or goodwill and cause a decline in our revenue 
any infringement or other intellectual property claim made against us  whether or not it has merit  could be time consuming  result in costly litigation  cause product delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
as a result  any such claim could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
failure to successfully integrate any business we acquire could have an adverse impact on our profitability 
we may from time to time acquire businesses which we believe to be complementary to our business 
acquisitions may result in difficulties in assimilating acquired companies and may result in the diversion of our capital and our management s attention from other business issues and opportunities 
we may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire  including their personnel  financial systems  distribution  operations and general operating procedures 
if we fail to successfully integrate acquisitions  we could experience increased costs associated with operating inefficiencies  which could have an adverse effect on our profitability 
risks related to our financial services business we may experience limited availability of financing or variation in funding costs for our financial services business  which could limit growth of the business and decrease our profitability 
our financial services business requires a significant amount of cash to operate 
these cash requirements will increase if our credit card originations increase or if our cardholders balances or spending increase 
historically  we have relied upon external financing sources to fund these operations  and we intend to continue to access external sources to fund our growth 
a number of factors such as our financial results  changes within our organization  disruptions in the capital markets  our corporate and regulatory structure  interest rate fluctuations  general economic conditions and accounting and regulatory changes and relations could make such financing more difficult or impossible to obtain or more expensive 
we have been  and will continue to be  particularly reliant on funding from securitization transactions for our financial services business 
securitization funding sources include both a commercial paper conduit facility and fixed and floating rate term securitizations 
our commercial paper conduit facility renews annually in july 
a failure to renew this facility  to resecuritize the term securitizations as they mature or to add additional term securitizations and commercial paper conduits on favorable terms as it becomes necessary could increase our financing costs and potentially limit our ability to grow our financial services business 
unfavorable conditions in the asset backed securities markets generally  including the unavailability of commercial bank liquidity support or credit enhancements  such as financial guaranty insurance  could have a similar effect 
furthermore  even if we are able to securitize our credit card loans consistent with past practice  poor performance of our securitized loans  including increased delinquencies and credit losses  lower payment rates or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds  could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in our securitization transactions  cause early amortization of these securities or result in higher required credit enhancement levels 
this could jeopardize our ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms  decrease our liquidity and force us to rely on other potentially more expensive funding sources  to the extent available  which would decrease our profitability 
we may have to reallocate capital from our direct and retail businesses to meet the capital needs of our financial services business  which could alter our destination retail store expansion program 
our bank subsidiary must satisfy the capital maintenance requirements of government regulators and its agreement with visa usa  inc  or visa 
a variety of factors could cause the capital requirements of our bank subsidiary to exceed our ability to generate capital internally or from third party sources 
for example  government regulators or visa could unilaterally increase their minimum capital requirements 
also  we have significant potential obligations in the form of the unused credit lines of our cardholders 
as of the end of fiscal  these unfunded amounts were approximately billion 
draws on these lines of credit could materially exceed predicted line usage 
in addition  the occurrence of certain events  such as significant defaults in payment of securitized loans or failure to comply with the terms of securitization covenants  may cause previously completed securitization transactions to amortize earlier than scheduled or be reclassified as a liability for financial accounting purposes  both of which would have a significant effect on our ability to meet the capital maintenance requirements of our bank subsidiary  as affected off balance sheet loans would immediately be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and would be subject to regulatory capital requirements 
if any of these factors occur  we may have to contribute capital to our bank subsidiary  which may require us to raise additional debt or equity capital and or divert capital from our direct and retail businesses  which in turn could significantly alter our destination retail store expansion strategy 
it may be difficult to sustain the historical growth and profitability of our financial services business  and we will be subject to various risks as we attempt to grow the business 
we may not be able to retain existing cardholders  grow account balances or attract new cardholders and the profits from our financial services business could decline  for a variety of reasons  many of which are beyond our control  including credit risk related to the loans we make to cardholders and the charge off levels of our credit card accounts  lack of growth of potential new customers generated by our direct and retail businesses  liquidity and funding risk relating to our ability to create the liquidity necessary to extend credit to our cardholders and provide the capital necessary to meet the requirements of government regulators and visa  and operational risk related to our ability to acquire the necessary operational and organizational infrastructure  manage expenses as we expand  and recruit management and operations personnel with the experience to run an increasingly complex and highly regulated business 
economic downturns and social and other factors could cause our credit card charge offs and delinquencies to increase  or credit card balances to decrease  which would decrease our profitability 
economic downturns generally lead to increased charge offs and credit losses in the consumer finance industry  which would cause us to experience increased charge offs and delinquencies in our credit card loan portfolio 
an economic downturn can hurt our financial performance as cardholders default on their balances or carry lower balances 
a variety of social and other factors also may cause changes in credit card use  payment patterns and the rate of defaults by cardholders 
these social factors include changes in consumer confidence levels  the public s perception of the use of credit cards  changing attitudes about incurring debt and the stigma of personal bankruptcy 
additionally  credit card accounts tend to exhibit a rising trend in credit loss and delinquency rates between to months after they are issued 
if the rate of growth in new account generation slows  the proportion of accounts in the portfolio that have been open for between to months will increase and the percentage of charge offs and delinquencies may increase 
our underwriting criteria and product design may be insufficient to protect the growth and profitability of our financial services business during a sustained period of economic downturn or recession or a material shift in social attitudes  and may be insufficient to protect against these additional negative factors 
the performance of our financial services business may be negatively affected by the performance of our merchandising businesses 
negative developments in our direct and retail businesses could affect our ability to grow or maintain our financial services business 
we believe our ability to maintain cardholders and attract new cardholders is highly correlated with customer loyalty to our merchandising businesses and to the strength of the cabela s brand 
in addition  transactions on cardholder accounts produce loyalty points which the cardholder may apply to future purchases from us 
adverse changes in the desirability of products we sell  negative trends in retail customer service and satisfaction or the termination or modification of the loyalty program could have a negative impact on our bank subsidiary s ability to grow its account base and to attract desirable co branding opportunities with third parties 
our financial services business faces the risk of a complex and changing regulatory and legal environment 
our financial services business operates in a heavily regulated industry and is therefore subject to a wide array of banking and consumer lending laws and regulations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in financial  structural and operational penalties being imposed 
in addition  as a visa member bank  our bank subsidiary must comply with rules and regulations imposed by visa 
for example  our bank subsidiary could be fined by visa for failing to comply with visa s data security standards 
changes in interest rates could have a negative impact on our earnings 
in connection with our financial services business  we borrow money from institutions and accept funds by issuing certificates of deposit  which we then lend to cardholders 
we earn interest on the cardholders account balances  and pay interest on the certificates of deposit and borrowings we use to fund those loans 
changes in these two interest rates affect the value of the assets and liabilities of our financial services business 
if the rate of interest we pay on borrowings increases more or more rapidly than the rate of interest we earn on loans  our net interest income  and therefore our earnings  could fall 
our earnings could also be adversely affected if the rates on our credit card account balances fall more quickly than those on our borrowings 
in addition  as of the end of fiscal  approximately of our cardholders did not maintain balances on their credit card accounts 
we do not earn any interest from these accounts but do earn other fees from these accounts such as visa interchange fees 
in the event interest rates rise  the spread between the interest rate we pay on our borrowings and the fees we earn from these accounts may change and our profitability may be adversely affected 
credit card industry litigation could adversely impact the amount of revenue generated by our financial services business 
our financial services business faces possible risk from the outcomes of certain credit card industry litigation 
for example  a number of entities  each purporting to represent a class of retail merchants  have sued visa and several member banks  and other credit card associations  alleging  among other things  that visa and its member banks have violated us antitrust laws by conspiring to fix the level of interchange fees 
to date  we have not been named as a defendant in any credit card industry lawsuits 
if the interchange fees that are charged to merchants are reduced as a result of the interchange lawsuits or if the credit card industry is adversely affected by other credit card industry litigation  the financial condition and results of operations of our financial services business may be negatively impacted 
fluctuations in the value of our interests in our securitizations relating to our financial services business may adversely affect our earnings 
in connection with our securitizations relating to our financial services business  we retain certain interests in the assets included in the securitization 
these interests are carried on our consolidated financial statements and include our retained interest  or a transferor s interest  in the securitized loans  an interest only strip  which represents our right to receive excess cash available after repayment of all amounts due to the investors  servicing rights  and in some cases cash reserve accounts and class b securities which are subordinate to the investors certificates and notes 
the value of these retained interests depends upon income earned on these interests which is affected by many factors not within our control  including the performance of the securitized loans  interest paid to the holders of securitization securities  credit losses and transaction expenses 
the value of our interests in the securitizations will vary over time as the amount of loans in the securitized pool and the performance of those loans fluctuate 
the performance of the loans included in our securitizations is subject to the same risks and uncertainties that affect the loans that we have not securitized  including  among others  increased delinquencies and credit losses  economic downturns and social factors  interest rate fluctuations  changes in government policies and regulations  competition  expenses  dependence upon third party vendors  fluctuations in accounts and account balances  and industry risks

when we use the term ebitda  we are referring to net income minus interest income  plus i interest expense  ii income taxes and iii depreciation and amortization  all as presented in the consolidated statements of income 
interest income and interest expense of wfb are not adjusted in calculating ebitda as these amounts are included in financial services revenue in the consolidated statements of income 
we present ebitda because we consider it an important supplemental measure of our performance 
we also use ebitda to determine our compliance with some of the covenants under our revolving credit facility 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool and you should not consider it in isolation or as a substitute for net income  operating income  cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities or any other measure calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
some of these limitations are ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures or future requirements for capital expenditures or capital commitments  ebitda does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  ebitda does not reflect the interest expense or cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debt  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  and other companies in our industry may calculate ebitda differently than we do  limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business and we rely primarily on our generally accepted accounting principles results and use ebitda only supplementally

business strategy we continue our legendary focus on customer service  quality and selection as our multi channel business strategy emphasizes the following key components continue to open new destination retail stores 
we have increased our destination retail store base from four stores in to in  representing million square feet of retail space 
we currently plan to open eight destination retail stores in  all of which have been announced 
through our extensive customer database and analysis of historical sales data generated by our direct business  we are able to identify geographic areas with a high concentration of customers that represent potential new markets for our destination retail stores 
we believe that there are many additional markets throughout north america that could potentially support one of our destination retail stores 
additionally  we believe that smaller format destination retail stores could provide further opportunities for future expansion 
our stores require large capital investments 
we are actively seeking ways to improve their operating efficiencies  layout and customer friendly design to increase our average customer transaction and improve our return on investment  including leasing retail store space 
expand our direct business 
we plan to expand our direct business through several initiatives surrounding existing and new customers 
we will seek to increase the amount each customer spends on our merchandise through enhanced customer targeting  continued introduction of new catalog titles and the development and marketing of new products 
we have taken advantage of web based technologies such as targeted promotional e mails  on line shopping engines and internet affiliate programs to increase sales 
we also are improving our customer relationship management system  which we expect will allow us to better manage our customer relationships and more effectively tailor our marketing programs 
we will use our expanding retail business to capitalize on additional customer purchase history and information 
expand our customer loyalty programs 
we intend to increase the penetration of our loyalty programs  including programs for our cabela s club visa credit card  our third party debit card and our cabela s club rewards loyalty card to attract a more diverse group of customers 
based upon historical results  we believe these programs will reinforce our customer loyalty and retention and thereby increase revenue and net income 
improve our operating efficiencies 
as we continue to grow our business through opening new destination retail stores and building our direct business  we are focused on improving our operating efficiencies by optimizing and investing in our management information systems and distribution and logistics capabilities 
we also are analyzing our catalog costs and inventory turns and concentrating on our sales training 
expand the reach of our brand and target market through complementary opportunities 
we focus on increasing consumer awareness of our company and maintaining and enhancing our outdoor lifestyle image by using consistent branding in all of our distribution channels 
we also will continue to effectively broaden the application of our brand through opportunistic acquisitions of complementary businesses  internal development of relevant businesses and product categories  and continued involvement and sponsorship of sporting and hunting events 
in addition  we will continue to leverage our brand recognition through conservation  corporate relationships and alliances 
trends and opportunities improving comparable store sales 
our comparable store sales improved in fiscal over fiscal we continue to focus initiatives on improving comparable store sales 
we experienced declines at some stores in our comparable store base due to gasoline prices as discussed below and due to our own cannibalization of market share 
catalog production and circulation costs 
costs of providing our catalogs continue to increase as postage and printing prices increase 
catalog costs increased by as a percentage of direct revenue in fiscal over we are mitigating these cost increases by entering into long term contracts for paper and printing and enhancing our in house production capabilities 
we continue to refine our customer contacts strategy through advanced analytic concepts to maximize total sales across all channels while minimizing processing and distribution costs 
growth of our credit card business 
we anticipate that financial services revenue will increase as our portfolio of managed loans matures  and we will seek to further increase financial services revenue by attracting new cardholders through low cost targeted marketing at our destination retail stores 
we will continue to control costs in our financial services segment by managing default rates  delinquencies and charge offs by continuing our underwriting and account management standards and practices 
we anticipate that we will continue to sell our credit card loans in the securitization markets and manage those customer accounts at the bank 
effect of retail expansion on direct business 
when we open a destination retail store in a new market  our direct revenue in that market generally experiences a decline during the first months after the new store opening despite a substantial increase in our retail revenue in that market due to the presence of our destination retail store 
the new retail store serves as a marketing tool in that geographic area 
as a result  approximately months after the opening of the destination retail store  direct revenue in that market has historically resumed its growth rate prior to the new retail store opening 
we were very pleased with the continued growth rate of our direct business in fiscal  a year in which we increased our retail sales by million and also increased our direct business by million  or  to reach nearly billion in sales 
effect of system enhancements on our operations 
through the completion of system enhancements over the past several years  we expect to see improvements in inventory turns  replenishment and fill rates  product availability and delivery 
gasoline prices 
increases in gasoline prices may affect our retail sales more negatively than our other retail competition 
we rely on destination retail store formats where some of our customers must drive hundreds of miles to visit our stores 
if gasoline prices increase  customers may opt to shop at competitors located closer to large populations 
our new retail store locations in  as well as future planned locations  are primarily located closer to larger metropolitan areas  which we believe will help mitigate the impact of gasoline price increases on our retail sales 
our direct business has historically been less affected by gasoline price increases 
our multi channel strategy helps mitigate our exposure to increases in gasoline prices 
land sales 
in fiscal  the amount of land sales decreased by million to million compared to million in fiscal these land sales are included in other revenue and pertain to sales of land around our destination retail stores 
the cost of the land is reflected in cost of other revenue as this land was held for sale 
the timing of the land sales and the varying gross profit of these land sales can have an impact on our annual and quarterly results of operations 
the margin on the sales of land can vary significantly depending on the circumstances and development plan for each location 
in fiscal  land sales contributed million of gross profit on million in sales  a gross margin on land sales  compared to million of gross profit on million in land sales for fiscal  an gross margin on land sales

given the variety of segments we report and the different cost classifications inherent in each of their respective businesses  it is difficult to compare our consolidated results on the basis of gross profit  or the difference between revenue and cost of revenue 
we believe that operating income presents a more meaningful measure of our consolidated operating performance than gross profit because of the following factors our financial services segment does not have costs classified as cost of revenue which results in a disproportionate gross profit contribution for this segment  we do not include occupancy costs  depreciation  direct labor or warehousing costs in cost of revenue  which affects comparability to other retailers who may account differently for some or all of these costs  and we have historically attempted to price our customer shipping charges to generally match our shipping expenses  which reduces gross profit as a percentage of direct revenue 
consequently  we believe that operating income is the best metric to compare the performance and profitability of our segments to each other and to judge our consolidated performance because it includes all applicable revenue and cost items 
results of operations our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to december all fiscal years presented consisted of weeks our operating results for fiscal years  and  expressed as a percentage of revenue  were as follows fiscal years revenue cost of revenue gross profit exclusive of depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest income interest expense other income net total other income expense income before provision for income taxes income tax expense net income segment information the following table sets forth the revenue and operating income of each of our segments for fiscal years  and fiscal years dollars in thousands direct revenue    retail revenue    financial services revenue    other revenue    total revenue    direct operating income    retail operating income    financial services operating income    other operating income loss    total operating income    as a percentage of total revenue direct revenue retail revenue financial services revenue other revenue total revenue as a percentage of segment revenue direct operating income retail operating income financial services operating income total operating income the percentage of total operating income is a percentage of total consolidated revenue

direct revenue 
direct revenue increased by million  or  to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal primarily due to growth in sales through our website

the general product category that contributed the largest dollar volume increase to our fiscal direct revenue growth was hunting equipment

the general product category that contributed the largest dollar volume increase to our retail revenue growth in fiscal was hunting equipment 
financial services revenue 
on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis  financial services revenue increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we measure the results of our financial services business on a non gaap managed basis as presented in the following table labeled managed financial services revenue presented on a non gaap basis 
interest income measured on a non gaap managed basis increased million 
the increase in interest income was due to an increase in interest rates and managed credit card loans 
interchange income  net of reward costs  increased by million  or 
interchange income is driven by net purchases  which increased by 
other income increased by million due to the fair value change of the interest only strips on our securitized loans the increases in interest income  interchange income and other income were offset by an increase in interest expense of million due to increases in securitized credit card loans  borrowings and interest rates

our managed credit card loans represent credit card loans receivable we own plus securitized credit card loans 
since the financial performance of the managed portfolio has a significant impact on the earnings we will receive from servicing the portfolio  we believe the following table on a managed basis is important information to analyze our revenue in the financial services segment 
this non gaap presentation reflects the financial performance of the credit card loans receivable we own plus those that have been sold for the fiscal years ended  and and includes the effect of recording the retained interest at fair value 
interest income  interchange income net of customer rewards and fee income on both the owned and securitized portfolio are recorded in their respective line items 
interest paid to outside investors on the securitized credit card loans is included with other interest costs and included in interest expense 
credit losses on the entire managed portfolio are included in provision for loan losses 
although our financial statements are not presented in this manner  management reviews the performance of its managed portfolio in order to evaluate the effectiveness of its origination and collection activities  which ultimately affects the income we will receive for servicing the portfolio 
the securitization of credit card loans primarily converts interest income  interchange income  credit card fees  credit losses and other income and expense related to the securitized loans into securitization income

these improvements in our gross margin were largely offset by an increase in sales discounts of of merchandise revenue 
these discounts were related to our promotional gift card campaign in our retail segment and a new promotional campaign in the direct business 
our shipping margin the shipping income we collect less the cost we pay to ship merchandise to our customers declined by of merchandise revenue 
the primary reason for the decline in shipping margin was caused by the implementation of our new warehouse management software  which caused us to ship more packages per order due to the inability to transfer products between distribution centers while the software was being phased in 
that issue was resolved in october selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were of revenue in fiscal compared to of revenue in fiscal we recognized million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal  which accounted for of the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue

our hamburg store was very successful in making comparable store sales challenging 
hurricanes in the southern part of the united states may have had some impact on our two new stores in texas  however the primary impact was the hurricanes effect on gasoline prices 
the product categories that contributed the largest dollar volume increase to our retail revenue growth in fiscal included hunting equipment  camping and footwear 
financial services revenue 
financial services revenue increased by million  or  to million in fiscal we measure the results of our financial services business on a non gaap managed basis as presented in the table on page interest income measured on a managed basis increased million

interchange income  net of reward costs  increased by million  or 
interchange income is driven by net purchases  which increased by 
in addition  our participation in a new reward program with visa increased our interchange income by million for the fiscal year 
customer reward costs  which are netted against financial services revenue  generally increase at the same rate as visa net purchases 
however  in fiscal  customer reward costs increased only million  or over fiscal the decrease in the growth rate of customer reward costs as compared to visa net purchases was caused by changes in some of our promotional event campaigns and the implementation of the instant credit program in our destination retail stores in the second fiscal quarter of instant credit allows customers to find out within minutes if they are approved for credit 
changes in our customer rewards program implemented in connection with instant credit have reduced the customer rewards costs related to the acquisition of new accounts 
other income increased by million due to the fair value change of the interest only strips on the securitized loans 
the increases in interest income  interchange income and other income were offset by an increase in interest expense of million due to increases in securitized credit card loans  borrowings and interest rates

however  this was offset by a decline in merchandising gross profit of of merchandise revenue  as discussed below  and a decline of in gross profit as a percent of revenue on our other revenue due to sales of land at relatively low gross profit 
merchandising business 
the gross profit of our merchandising business increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as a percentage of merchandise revenue  gross profit declined by to in fiscal from in fiscal the decline was attributable to increased freight costs due to higher fuel prices 
freight costs increased by of merchandise revenue to of merchandise revenue in fiscal compared to of merchandise revenue in fiscal declines in gross profit due to freight costs were offset by improved merchandising practices and less discounting as a percentage of merchandise revenue over the prior year

our credit card discount fees increased by million 
as a percentage of revenue these fees increased as interchange rates have increased 
repairs and maintenance costs increased by million related to a software and equipment maintenance agreement for our customer relations department 
these increases in selling  general and administrative expenses were partially offset by an increase in the marketing fee allocated to our direct segment from our financial services segment of million  or of direct revenue 
retail selling  general and administrative expenses comprised million of the total increase in selling  general and administrative expense primarily due to having more stores and to increased new store development and pre opening costs 
we break these costs into three categories 
the first category is pre opening and new store development costs  which are all costs that we incur prior to a store s opening 
the second category is the selling  general and administrative costs of new stores after they have opened  but before they are included in the comparable store base 
the final category is the selling  general and administrative expenses that are incurred by the stores in our comparable store base 
in fiscal  our new store development and pre opening costs increased by million related to our retail expansion efforts 
we also had four new stores that accounted for an increase of million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increases in selling  general and administrative expenses related to new stores were partially offset by a reduction of million in the selling  general and administrative expenses of stores in our comparable store base  compared to those same stores in the prior year  and by an increase in the marketing fee allocated to our retail segment from our financial services segment of million  or of retail revenue

operating income operating income increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to the factors discussed above 
other income other income increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in interest earned from economic development bonds of million in fiscal this increase was offset by decreases in gain on sale of investment and equity recognized for an unconsolidated subsidiary of million related to the sale of our investment in great wolf lodge  llc in fiscal interest expense interest expense increased by million in fiscal to million as compared with million in fiscal the interest expense increase was primarily due to increased borrowings on our revolving line of credit 
in fiscal  we were able to utilize the proceeds from our initial public offering rather than incurring interest on our revolving line of credit 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in our effective tax rate is a result of us entering additional states during  changing our estimated rate on deferred taxes and truing up our prior year s tax provision 
we expect that our effective tax rate will continue to increase as we enter more states with our destination retail stores 
quarterly results of operations for fiscal years and and seasonal influences due to holiday buying patterns and hunting and fishing season openings across the country  merchandise revenue is typically higher in the third and fourth quarters than in the first and second quarters 
we anticipate our revenue will continue to be seasonal in nature 
the following table sets forth unaudited financial and operating data in each quarter during fiscal years and this quarterly information has been prepared on a basis consistent with our audited financial statements and includes all normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair presentation of the information shown 
this information should be read in conjunction with our selected financial data and audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of these and a variety of other factors  and operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for a full fiscal year

bank asset quality we securitize a majority of our credit card loans 
on a quarterly basis  we transfer eligible credit card loans into a securitization trust 
we are required to own at least a minimum twenty day average of of the interests in the securitization trust 
therefore  these retained loans have the same characteristics as those loans sold to outside investors 
certain accounts are ineligible for securitization because they are delinquent at the time of sales to the trust  originated from sources other than cabela s club visa credit cards and various other requirements 
the total amount of ineligible loans and receivables were million and million at fiscal year end and fiscal year end  respectively 
the quality of our managed credit card loan portfolio at any time reflects  among other factors  the creditworthiness of the individual cardholders  general economic conditions  the success of our account management and collection activities  and the life cycle stage of the portfolio 
our financial results are sensitive to changes in delinquencies and net charge offs of this portfolio 
during periods of economic weakness  delinquencies and net charge offs are more likely to increase 
we have sought to manage this sensitivity by selecting a customer base that has historically shown it to be very creditworthy based on charge off levels  credit bureau scores such as fico scores and behavior scores 
the median fico scores of our securitized loans were and in and  respectively 
our average managed credit card loans outstanding increased by million  or  to  million in fiscal from  million in fiscal we believe that as credit card accounts mature they are less likely to charge off and less likely to be closed 
the following table shows our managed loans outstanding at the end of fiscal and by months since the account opened 
loans percentage loans percentage of outstanding of total outstanding total months since account opened dollars in thousands months or less   months   months   months   months   months   months   months   months   total   delinquencies we consider the entire balance of an account  including any accrued interest and fees  delinquent if the minimum payment is not received by the payment due date 
our aging methodology is based on the number of completed billing cycles during which a customer has failed to make a required payment 
delinquencies not only have the potential to reduce earnings by increasing the unrealized loss recognized to reduce the loans to market value and reducing securitization income  but they also result in additional operating costs dedicated to resolving the delinquencies 
the following chart shows the percentage of our managed loans that have been delinquent as of the end of fiscal  and fiscal year number of days delinquent greater than days greater than days greater than days charge offs gross charge offs reflect the uncollectible principal  interest and fees on a customer s account 
recoveries reflect the amounts collected on previously charged off accounts 
most bankcard issuers charge off accounts at days 
we charge off accounts on the th day of the month after an account becomes days contractually delinquent  except in the case of cardholder bankruptcies and cardholder deaths 
cardholder bankruptcies are charged off days after notification  and delinquencies caused by cardholder deaths are charged off on the th day of the month after an account is days contractually delinquent 
as a result  our charge off rates are not directly comparable to other participants in the bankcard industry 
our charge off activity for the managed portfolio for fiscal years  and is summarized below fiscal year dollars in thousands gross charge offs    recoveries    net charge offs    net charge offs as a percentage of average managed loans liquidity and capital resources overview our merchandising business and our financial services segment have significantly different liquidity and capital needs 
the primary cash requirements of our merchandising business relate to capital for new destination retail stores  purchases of economic development bonds related to the construction of new destination retail stores  purchases of inventory  investments in our management information systems and other infrastructure  and other general working capital needs 
we historically have met these requirements by generating cash from our merchandising business operations  borrowing under revolving credit facilities  issuing debt and equity securities  obtaining economic development grants from state and local governments in connection with developing our destination retail stores  collecting principal and interest payments on our economic development bonds and from the retirement of economic development bonds 
the cash flow we generate from our merchandising business is seasonal  with our peak cash requirements for inventory occurring between may and november 
while we have consistently generated overall positive annual cash flow from our operating activities  other sources of liquidity are generally required by our merchandising business during these peak cash use periods 
these sources historically have included short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to debt markets  such as the private placement of long term debt securities we completed in february while we generally have been able to manage our cash needs during peak periods  if any disruption occurred to our funding sources  or if we underestimated our cash needs  we would be unable to purchase inventory and otherwise conduct our merchandising business to its maximum effectiveness  which would result in reduced revenue and profits 
the primary cash requirements of our financial services segment relate to the generation of credit card loans and the purchase of points used in the cabela s club visa customer loyalty rewards program from our merchandising business 
the bank obtains funds for these cash requirement purposes through various financing activities  which include funding from securitization transactions  borrowing under federal funds bank credit facilities  accepting certificates of deposit and generating cash from operations 
our bank s charter is limited to issuing credit cards and accepting brokered certificates of deposit of one hundred thousand dollars or more  and it does not accept demand deposits or make non credit card loans 
consequently  our bank cannot lend money to cabela s incorporated or our other affiliates 
the bank is subject to capital requirements imposed by nebraska banking law and the visa membership rules  and its ability to pay dividends is limited by nebraska and federal banking law 
we continue to monetize our economic development bonds for future retail destination store expansion 
in the second quarter of fiscal  million in bonds we owned related to our wheeling  west virginia retail store and distribution center were retired in connection with a transaction whereby we took a subordinate position on the remaining bonds we hold related to this location 
these remaining bonds are classified on our consolidated balance sheet as marketable securities with a value of approximately million 
we have received notification from the bondholders that they intend to retire the remainder of this issuance in we are also focused on improving our inventory position in relation to sales growth through technological investments 
inventory at our comparable stores declined at the end of fiscal year compared to we are optimistic that we will continue to see our inventory growth slow in relation to our merchandise sales growth as we continue to enhance our multi channel merchandising systems 
we believe that we will have sufficient capital available from current cash on hand  expected future operations  additional monetization of our economic development bonds  our revolving credit facility and other borrowing sources to fund our existing operations and growth plans for the next to months 
operating  investing and financing activities the following table presents changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the fiscal years ended in thousands net cash provided by operating activities   net cash used in investing activities   net cash provided by used in financing activities   cash provided by operating activities decreased million for fiscal compared to fiscal this net decrease was primarily due to a million net decrease between years related to the bank s funding from securitization transactions 
for fiscal  the bank used cash for credit card originations net of cash received from collections  proceeds from new securitizations and changes in retained interests of million compared to million in cash used for inventory increased million over as we added four new destination retail stores 
cash used for income taxes payable also increased by million over due to the timing of federal and state income tax payments and the increased profitability of the company 
in addition  increases totaling million comparing fiscal over relate to the use of cash from accounts receivable  land held for sale and other assets 
partially offsetting these decreases to cash from operating activities was a net increase of million in net income adjusted for non cash expenditures for deferred income taxes  depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and other items 
cash provided from prepaid expenses and deferred catalog costs increased by million over primarily due to the timing of catalog production costs 
cash was also provided from various liabilities and accruals that increased by a net of million over in addition  accounts payable increased by million from due to net increases in inventory payables of million over  partially offset by decreases of million in the payable to the third party processor for the bank s credit card transactions and million in payables for catalog costs 
the decreases are related to third party processor timing issues from and the timing in the catalog production work 
cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase in cash over is partly attributable to an increase in accounts payable of million 
the increase in accounts payable was primarily due to a difference in accrued payment for our third party processor of million at our bank 
the increased activity on our credit cards and timing of the last day of the year being on a saturday resulted in the amount of the third party processor payable increase 
accrued costs related to our catalogs also increased accounts payable by million due to timing of production work on catalogs 
cash increased due to the sale of interests in credit card loans in connection with securitization transactions in excess of cash used to originate credit card loans by million 
cash used for income taxes payable increased by million 
this was partially offset by an increase in our deferred income tax balance 
sales of land held for sale increased our cash by million in fiscal compared to fiscal accrued compensation and benefits increased by million over attributed to increases in retail payroll and timing of when it was paid 
in addition  gift certificates and credit card reward points increased by million over these increases were partially offset by increases in uses of cash 
cash used for inventory increased by million related to the stocking of four new destination retail stores 
cash used for other current assets increased by million primarily due to an increase in the prepaid amount for visa interchange funding and an increase in prepaid expenses of million primarily related to the timing of catalog production costs 
the following table highlights the growth of our destination retail stores and the activity of economic development bonds related to the construction of these stores and related projects for the fiscal years ended dollars in thousands capital expenditures    purchases of marketable securities    proceeds from retirements and maturities of marketable securities number of new destination retail stores opened during fiscal year number of destination retail stores leased at end of fiscal year none none cash used in investing activities increased million in fiscal compared to fiscal the net increase in cash used was primarily due to the purchases  net of maturities  of short term investments of million during compared to partially offsetting this increase were net decreases in the purchases of marketable securities of million and in capital expenditures of million 
the decrease in the purchases of marketable securities is related to the timing on the opening of certain new destination retail stores and the incentives related to those stores 
in addition  we continue to monetize our economic development bonds for future retail destination store expansion 
in fiscal  million in bonds we owned related to our wheeling  west virginia retail store and distribution center were retired in connection with a transaction whereby we took a subordinate position on the remaining bonds we hold related to this location 
these remaining bonds are classified on our consolidated balance sheet as marketable securities with a value of approximately million 
we have received notification from the bond trustee that it intends to retire the remainder of this issuance in we opened four retail destination stores in both fiscal years and one of our retail stores that opened in is leased with funding coming from economic development bonds or marketable securities 
as of december   we had entered into material commitments totaling approximately million for fiscal and million for fiscal primarily for estimated capital expenditures and the purchase of future economic development bonds in connection with the construction and development of new destination retail stores 
this does not include any amounts for contractual obligations associated with our lacey  washington  hammond  indiana  adairsville  georgia  and montreal  canada  destination retail stores  which are in the process of negotiations 
certain contractual aspects of these locations are still being negotiated and will be subject to customary conditions to closing 
we expect the total cost of each of these destination retail stores  including the cost of economic development bonds  to fall in the estimated range of to million each 
we expect to incur the majority of the costs for these locations in and in addition  we are obligated to fund the remaining million of economic development bonds and construction costs related to the expansion of our distribution center in wheeling  west virginia 
we are also committed to fund million of economic development bonds related to our fiscal stores 
when the bonds are funded  we will be reimbursed for the qualifying construction costs we have incurred 
cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal the decrease in cash used was primarily due to a reduction in purchases of short term investments of million and an increase in sales of short term investments of million 
in addition  local governments retired the bonds we owned related to our kansas city  kansas store and bonds related to our prairie du chien  wisconsin store for million in principal 
the cash provided by these investing activities was offset by an increase in capital expenditures of million due to our retail expansion efforts 
cash provided by financing activities totaled million in fiscal compared with cash used of million in fiscal this net increase in cash was primarily due to the debt issuance of million in february to support our destination retail store expansion and the net increase of million in short term borrowings and inventory financing 
partially offsetting this increase were decreases in time deposits of million and change in unpresented checks net of bank balance of million due to timing of when checks cleared our bank 
cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal as compared with cash provided of million in fiscal the difference in cash used was primarily the proceeds from our initial public offering  which raised net proceeds of million in fiscal in fiscal  our first principal installment of million was due on our private placement of debt that was issued in the change in unpresented checks net of bank balance used cash of million due to timing of when checks cleared our bank 
the change in bank time deposits also used cash of million as we had more time deposits mature than in fiscal retail store expansion significant amounts of cash will be needed in order to open new destination retail stores and implement our retail growth strategy 
depending upon the location and a variety of other factors  including store size and the amount of public improvements necessary  and based upon our prior experience  opening a single destination retail store may require expenditures of million to million 
this amount includes the cost of real estate  site work  public improvements such as utilities and roads  buildings  equipment  fixtures including taxidermy and inventory 
historically  we have been able to negotiate economic development arrangements relating to the construction of a number of our new destination retail stores  including free land  monetary grants and the recapture of incremental sales  property or other taxes through economic development bonds  with many local and state governments 
we design our destination retail stores to provide exciting tourist and entertainment shopping experiences for the entire family 
our destination retail stores also employ many people from the local community  draw customer traffic from a broad geographic range and serve as a catalyst for the opening of additional retail businesses such as restaurants  hotels and gas stations in the surrounding areas 
we believe these factors increase the revenue for the state and the local municipality where the destination retail store is located  making us a compelling partner for community development and expansion 
where appropriate  we intend to continue to utilize economic development arrangements with state and local governments to offset some of the construction costs and improve the return on investment of our new retail stores 
the stores we opened in and are located closer to larger populations 
we believe this strategy will make our stores more convenient for our customers and will increase our market share 
we successfully opened four destination retail stores in  increasing our total retail square footage by  feet or 
our four destination retail stores opened in are located in glendale  arizona  boise  idaho  richfield  wisconsin and lavista  nebraska 
we have also announced plans for destination retail stores in reno  nevada hazelwood  missouri  east hartford  connecticut  hoffman estates  illinois  lacey  washington  gonzales  louisiana  hammond  indiana  post falls  idaho  adairsville  georgia  montreal  canada  wheat ridge  colorado and east rutherford  new jersey 
in addition to the cash commitments for capital expenditures and economic development bonds as discussed in the analysis of cash flows section  we have entered into certain lease agreements for retail locations 
we have entered into four leases as of december  one of these leases is a capital lease and is anticipated to be recorded in fiscal when the lease commences 
the other three leases are operating leases 
in fiscal  we began recognizing rent expense for two of these leases  which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
certain of these leases include tenant allowances that will be amortized over the life of the lease 
we will receive tenant allowances in the amounts of million and million and  respectively 
these long term leases include options to renew with total terms  including extensions  varying from to years 
some of these leases for constructed assets contain customary conditions of performance by other parties 
grants 
under various grant programs  state or local governments provide funding for certain costs associated with developing and opening a new destination retail store 
we generally have received grant funding in exchange for commitments  such as assurance of agreed employment and wage levels at our destination retail stores or that the destination retail store will remain open  made by us to the state or local government providing the funding 
the commitments typically phase out over approximately five to years 
if we fail to maintain the commitments during the applicable period  the funds we received may have to be repaid or other adverse consequences may arise  which could affect our cash flows and profitability 
as of december  and december   the total amount of grant funding subject to a specific contractual remedy was million and million  respectively 
economic development bonds 
through economic development bonds  the state or local government sells bonds to provide funding for land acquisition  readying the site  building infrastructure and related eligible expenses associated with the construction and equipping of our destination retail stores 
generally  we have been the sole purchaser of these bonds 
the bond proceeds that are received by the governmental entity are then used to fund the construction and equipping of new destination retail stores and related infrastructure development 
while purchasing these bonds involves an initial cash outlay by us in connection with a new store  some or all of these costs can be recaptured through the repayments of the bonds 
the payments of principal and interest on the bonds are typically tied to sales  property or lodging taxes generated from the store and  in some cases  from businesses in the surrounding area  over periods which range between and years 
in addition  some of the bonds that we have purchased may be repurchased for par value by the governmental entity prior to the maturity date of the bonds 
however  the governmental entity from which we purchase the bonds is not otherwise liable for repayment of principal and interest on the bonds to the extent that the associated taxes are insufficient to pay the bonds 
in one location  the bonds will become subordinated to other bonds associated with the development if we fail to continue to operate the store over a prescribed period 
after purchasing the bonds  we typically carry them on our consolidated balance sheet as available for sale marketable securities and value them based upon management s projections of the amount of tax revenue expected to be generated to support principal and interest payments on the bonds 
we have limited experience in valuing these bonds and  because of the unique features of each project  there is no independent market data for valuation of these types of bonds 
if sufficient tax revenue is not generated by the subject properties  we will not receive scheduled payments and will be unable to realize the full value of the bonds carried on our consolidated balance sheet 
see critical accounting policies and use of estimates economic development bonds and risk factors risks related to our merchandising business the failure of properties to generate sufficient taxes to amortize the economic development bonds owned by us that relate to the development of such properties would have an adverse impact on our cash flows and profitability 
as of december  and december   we carried million and million  respectively  of economic development bonds on our consolidated balance sheet 
the negotiation of these economic development arrangements has been important to our destination retail store expansion in the past  and we believe these arrangements will continue to be an important factor in our destination retail store expansion strategy because they allow us to avoid or recapture a portion of the costs involved with opening a new store 
if similar packages are unavailable in the future or the terms are not as favorable to us  our return on investment in new stores would be adversely affected 
securitization of credit card loans our financial services segment historically has funded most of its growth in credit card loans through an asset securitization program 
asset securitization is a practice commonly used by credit card issuers to fund credit card loans at attractive rates 
the bank enters into asset securitization transactions  which involve the two tier sale of a pool of credit card loans from the bank to a wholly owned special purpose entity  and from that wholly owned special purpose entity to a second special purpose entity that is organized as a trust 
the trust is administered by an independent trustee 
because the trust qualifies as a qualified special purpose entity within the meaning of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities fas  its assets and liabilities are not consolidated in our balance sheet in accordance with fas the trust issues to outside investors various forms of certificates and notes each of which has an undivided interest in the assets of the trust 
the trust pays to the holders of the certificates and notes a portion of future scheduled cash flows under preset terms and conditions  the receipt of which is dependent upon cash flows generated by the underlying performance of the assets of the trust 
we retain a transferor s interest in the securitized loans  which ranks equal with the investor certificates and notes  an interest only strip  which represent the right to receive excess cash available after repayment of all amounts to the investors  servicing rights  cash reserve accounts in some cases and class b securities in one of the securitizations 
neither the investors nor the trust have recourse against us beyond the assets of the trust  other than for breaches of certain customary representations  warranties and covenants and minimum account balance levels which must be maintained to support our retained interests 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and the related indemnities  do not protect the trust or the outside investors against credit related losses on the loans 
in accordance with fas  we record our interest only strips as an asset at fair value  which is an amount equal to the estimated present value of cash flows to be received by us over the expected outstanding period of the loans 
these cash flows essentially represent finance charges and late fees in excess of the amounts paid to certificate and note holders  credit losses  and servicing and administration fees 
we use certain valuation assumptions related to the average lives of the loans sold and anticipated credit losses  as well as the appropriate market discount rate  in determining the estimated present value of the interest only strips 
changes in the average life of the loans sold  discount rate  and credit loss percentage could adversely impact the actual value of the interest only strips 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from the estimates  and changes in circumstances could result in significant future changes to the assumptions currently being used 
gains on securitization transactions  fair value adjustments and earnings on our securitizations are included in consolidated revenue in the consolidated statement of income and the cash reserve accounts  class b securities and the interest only strips are included on our consolidated balance sheet as retained interests in securitized loans 
all of the bank s securitization transactions are currently accounted for as sale transactions 
as a result  the loans relating to those pools of assets are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet  other than our transferor s interest  cash reserve accounts  class b securities and interest only strips 
a credit card loan represents a financial asset 
unlike a mortgage or other closed end loan account  the terms of a credit card account permit a customer to borrow additional amounts and to repay each month an amount the customer chooses  subject to a monthly minimum payment requirement 
the credit card account remains open after repayment of the balance and the customer may continue to use it to borrow additional amounts 
we reserve the right to change the credit card account terms  including interest rates and fees  in accordance with the terms of the credit card agreement and applicable law 
the credit card account is  therefore  separate and distinct from the loan 
in a credit card securitization  the credit card account relationships are not sold to the securitization entity 
we retain ownership of the credit card account relationship  including the right to change the terms of the credit card account 
we sell our credit card loans in the ordinary course of business through a commercial paper conduit program and longer term fixed and floating rate securitization transactions 
in a conduit securitization  our credit card loans are converted into securities and sold to commercial paper issuers  which pool the securities with those of other issuers 
the amount securitized in a conduit structure is allowed to fluctuate within the terms of the facility  which may provide greater flexibility for liquidity needs 
the total amounts and maturities for our credit card securitizations as of the end of fiscal year were as follows initial series type amount interest rate expected final maturity dollars in thousands series i term  floating january series i term  fixed march series ii term  floating march series i term  fixed october series i term  floating october series iii term  fixed october series iii term  floating october series i variable funding  floating july  the trust has entered into an agreement to convert the floating rate certificate into a fixed rate obligation 
we have been  and will continue to be  particularly reliant on funding from securitization transactions for our financial services segment 
a failure to renew existing facilities or to add additional capacity on favorable terms as it becomes necessary could increase our financing costs and potentially limit our ability to grow our financial services business 
unfavorable conditions in the asset backed securities markets generally  including the unavailability of commercial bank liquidity support or credit enhancements  such as financial guaranty insurance  could have a similar effect 
furthermore  poor performance of our securitized credit card loans  including increased delinquencies and credit losses  lower payment rates or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds  could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in our securitization transactions  cause early amortization of these securities or result in higher required credit enhancement levels 
this could jeopardize our ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms  decrease our liquidity and force us to rely on other potentially more expensive funding sources  to the extent available  which would decrease our profitability 
certificates of deposit we utilize certificates of deposit to partially finance the operating activities of our bank 
our bank issues certificates of deposit in a minimum amount of  in various maturities 
as of december   we had million of certificates of deposit outstanding with maturities ranging from january to april and with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 
certificate of deposit borrowings are subject to regulatory capital requirements 
credit facilities and other indebtedness we are party to a credit agreement that provides for a million unsecured revolving credit facility that expires on june  the credit facility may be increased to million upon our request and the consent of the banks party to the credit agreement 
the credit agreement permits the issuance of up to million in letters of credit and standby letters of credit  the nominal amount of which are applied against the overall credit limit available under the credit facility 
during the term of the facility  we are required to pay a quarterly facility fee  which ranges from to of the average daily unused principal balance on the line of credit 
interest on advances is calculated at the greater of i us bank national association s prime rate  ii the average rate on the federal funds rate in effect for the day plus one half of one percent or iii the eurodollar rate of interest plus a margin which adjusts based upon certain financial ratios we achieve and ranges from to 
the weighted average interest rate for borrowings on the line of credit was during fiscal year there were no principal borrowings outstanding under the credit facility as of december  the average outstanding amount of letters of credit during fiscal was million 
the average principal amount outstanding during fiscal was million 
our total remaining borrowing capacity under the credit facility as of december   after subtracting outstanding letters of credit of million  and standby letters of credit of million  was million 
the credit agreement requires that we comply with several financial and other covenants  including requirements that we maintain the following financial ratios as set forth in the credit agreement a fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter 
the fixed charge coverage ratio is defined as a ebitr minus the sum of any cash dividends  tax expenses paid in cash  in each case for the twelve month period ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter  and to the extent not included  or previously included  in the calculation of ebitr  any cash payments with respect to contingent obligations  to b the sum of interest expense  all required principal payments with respect to coverage indebtedness and operating lease obligations  in each case for the twelve month period ending on the last day of the fiscal quarter 
our credit agreement defines ebitr as net income before deductions for income taxes  interest expense and operating lease obligations 
a cash flow leverage ratio of no more than to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter for the twelve month period ending on that day 
the cash flow leverage ratio is defined as adjusted coverage indebtedness average indebtedness of the company on a consolidated basis for the preceding four fiscal quarters determined in accordance with gaap excluding a liabilities of wfb  b long term deferred compensation  c long term deferred taxes  d any current liabilities other than coverage indebtedness  and e deferred grant income to ebitda 
our credit agreement defines ebitda as net income before deductions for income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization  all as determined on aconsolidated basis in accordance with gaap 
a minimum tangible net worth of no less than million plus of positive consolidated net income on a cumulative basis for each fiscal year beginning with the fiscal year ended as of the last day of any fiscal quarter 
tangible net worth is equity less intangible assets 
the credit agreement also contains cross default provisions to other outstanding debt 
in the event we fail to comply with these covenants  a default is triggered 
in the event of default  all outstanding letters of credit and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately become due and payable 
in addition  our new credit agreement includes a limitation that we may not pay dividends to our stockholders in excess of of our prior year s consolidated ebitda and a provision that permits acceleration by the lenders in the event there is a change in control 
our credit agreement defines ebitda to mean our net income before deductions for income taxes  interest expense  depreciation and amortization 
based upon this ebitda calculation for fiscal  dividends would not be permissible in in excess of million 
our credit agreement defines a change in control to mean any of the following circumstances a we cease to own  directly or indirectly  of the shares of each class of the voting stock or other equity interest of each other borrower that has or has had total assets in excess of million  b the acquisition or ownership  directly or indirectly  beneficially or of record  by any person or group within the meaning of the securities exchange act of and the rules of the securities and exchange commission thereunder as in effect on july   of equity interests representing more than of the aggregate ordinary voting power represented by our issued and outstanding equity interests other than equity interests held by richard n 
cabela or james w 
cabela or a group controlled by richard n 
cabela or james w 
cabela  or c occupation of a majority of the seats other than vacant seats on our board of directors by persons who were neither i nominated by our board of directors nor ii appointed by directors so nominated 
our credit agreement provides that all loans or deposits from us or any of our subsidiaries to our bank cannot exceed million in the aggregate at any time when loans are outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
we are party to inventory financing agreements that allow certain vendors providing boat and all terrain vehicle merchandise to give us extended payment terms 
the vendors are responsible for all interest payments for the financing period and the financing company holds a security interest in the specific inventory we hold 
our revolving credit facility limits this security interest to million 
we record this merchandise in inventory with an offsetting liability in accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet 
the loans and payments are reflected in the financing section of our consolidated cash flow statements as advances and payments on lines of credit 
the extended payment terms to the vendors do not exceed one year 
the outstanding liability under the inventory financing agreements was million at the end of fiscal our bank has an unsecured uncommitted federal funds purchase agreement with a financial institution 
the maximum amount of funds that can be outstanding is million of which no amounts were outstanding at december  our bank also has an unsecured uncommitted federal funds purchase agreement with another financial institution 
the maximum amount of funds which can be outstanding is million of which million was outstanding at december  in addition to our credit facilities  we have accessed the private placement debt markets 
at the end of fiscal  we had three such note issuances outstanding 
on february   we issued million in unsecured notes  with principal payable in full in ten years and interest payable semiannually at a rate of 
these notes require that we comply with several financial and other covenants  including requirements that we maintain the following financial ratios as set forth in the note purchase agreements a consolidated adjusted net worth in an amount not less than the sum of i million plus ii of positive consolidated net earnings on a cumulative basis for each fiscal year beginning with fiscal year a fixed charge coverage ratio the ratio of consolidated cash flow to consolidated fixed charges for each period of four consecutive fiscal quarters of no less than to as of the last day of any fiscal quarter 
a consolidated funded debt to total funded capitalization of no more than 
in  we issued million in senior unsecured notes bearing interest at a fixed rate of and payable in annual installments of million 
the principal balance on these notes at december   was million 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes 
we may or may not engage in future long term borrowing transactions to fund our operations or our growth plans 
whether or not we undertake such borrowings will depend on a variety of factors  including prevailing interest rates  our retail growth plans  our financial strength  alternative sources and costs of funding and our management s assessment of potential returns on investment that may be realized from the proceeds of such borrowings 
impact of inflation we do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three fiscal years 
we cannot assure  however  that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables provide summary information concerning our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of fiscal year end contractual obligations thereafter total in thousands long term debt     interest payments        capital lease obligation        operating leases        time deposits by maturity      obligations under new store and expansion arrangements      purchase obligations      deferred compensation   total       these amounts do not include estimated interest payments due under our revolving credit facility described below in other commercial commitments because the amount that will be borrowed under this facility in future years is uncertain 
the capital lease obligation is for the lease of our wheeling  west virginia distribution center which runs through june includes amounts due under operating leases for our boise  idaho destination retail store that opened in fiscal and another destination retail store that will be opened in fiscal obligations under new store and expansion arrangements include approximately million of contractual obligations  including the purchase of bonds  associated with eight of our destination retail stores scheduled to open in and  obligations under economic development bonds and the estimated future obligations of a capital lease 
our purchase obligations relate primarily to purchases of inventory  shipping and other goods and services in the ordinary course of business under binding purchase orders or contracts 
the amount of purchase obligations shown is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of purchase orders or contracts we had outstanding as of fiscal year end under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders under applicable laws  the amount of purchase obligations shown in the preceding table would be less 
the preceding table does not include any amounts for contractual obligations associated with our lacey  washington  hammond  indiana  adairsville  georgia  and montreal  canada  destination retail stores  which are in the process of negotiations 
certain contractual aspects of these locations are still being negotiated and will be subject to customary conditions to closing 
we expect the total cost of each of these destination retail stores  including the cost of economic development bonds  to fall in the estimated range of to million each 
we expect to incur the majority of the costs for these locations in and other commercial commitments thereafter total in thousands revolving line of credit revolving line of credit for boat and atv inventory   bank federal funds   letters of credit   standby letters of credit   total   our credit agreement allows for maximum borrowings of million including lender letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
as of fiscal year end  the total amount available for borrowing under this revolving line of credit  including lender letters of credit and standby letters of credit  was million 
the line of credit for boat and atv financing is limited by the aforementioned million revolving line of credit to million of secured collateral 
the maximum amount that can be borrowed on the federal funds agreements is million 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases 
we lease various items of office equipment and buildings 
rent expense for these operating leases is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses of the consolidated statements of income 
future obligations are shown in the preceding contractual obligations table 
credit card limits 
the bank bears off balance sheet risk in the normal course of its business 
one form of this risk is through the bank s commitment to extend credit to cardholders up to the maximum amount of their credit limits 
the aggregate of such potential funding requirements totaled billion as of december  and billion as of december   which amounts were in addition to existing balances cardholders had at such dates 
these funding obligations are not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
while the bank has not experienced  and does not anticipate that it will experience  a significant draw down of unfunded credit lines by customers  a significant draw down would create a cash need at the bank which likely could not be met by our available cash and funding sources 
the bank has the right to reduce or cancel these available lines of credit at any time 
securitizations 
as previously described under securitization of credit card loans  all of the bank s securitization transactions have been accounted for as sales transactions and the credit card loans relating to those pools of assets are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
bank dividend limitations and minimum capital requirements the ability of the bank to pay dividends to us is limited 
such dividends  which would only be made at the discretion of our board of directors and the bank s board of directors  may be limited by a variety of factors  such as regulatory capital requirements  dividend restriction statutes  broad enforcement powers possessed by regulatory agencies and requirements imposed by membership in visa 
under the nebraska banking act  dividends may only be paid out of net profits on hand  which the nebraska banking act defines as the remainder of all earnings from current operations plus actual recoveries on loans and investments and other assets  after deducting from the total thereof all current operating expenses  losses and bad debts  accrued dividends on preferred stock  if any  and federal and state taxes for the present and two immediately preceding calendar years 
based on these various restrictions  and assuming the same net profit levels in as in  the bank would not be permitted to pay us more than million in dividends during the bank had million in retained earnings at the end of due to minimum capital requirements under banking laws and the visa membership rules  we may be required from time to time to infuse additional capital into the bank so the bank can continue to fund its credit card portfolio growth 
shelf registration on september   we filed a form s registration statement to register  shares of common stock 
we will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock in this offering 
the timing and amount of any sale are within the sole discretion of the selling stockholders named in the prospectus contained in the form s registration statement or any amendment to the form s registration statement or supplement to the prospectus contained in the form s registration statement 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the estimates and assumptions are evaluated on a periodic basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies discussed below are the ones we believe are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
merchandising revenue recognition revenue is recognized for retail sales at the time of the sale in the store 
for direct sales  revenue is recognized when the merchandise is delivered to the customer  with the time of delivery being based on our estimate of shipping time from our distribution facility to the customer 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns in each reporting period 
the amount of this reserve is based upon our historical return experience and our future expectations 
if our estimates for these returns are too low  and we receive more returns than we estimated  we would have a significant mismatching of revenue and expenses in the following period 
shipping fees charged to customers are included in revenue and shipping costs are included in cost of revenue 
gift certificates and gift cards gift instruments are recorded in revenue as the gift instruments are redeemed for merchandise 
the gift instruments are recorded as a liability prior to their redemption 
the company records breakage as revenue related to its gift instruments using a specific identification approach 
breakage is recognized as revenue when the probability of redemption  which is based on company historical gift instrument redemption patterns  is remote 
inventories merchandise inventories  net of allowances for shrink  returned or damaged goods and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the last in first out method  or lifo  for all inventories except for those inventories owned by our wholly owned subsidiaries van dyke supply company  inc and wild wings  llc  which use the first in  first out method 
we use a dollar value  link chain method in calculating lifo 
current year prices are determined using an internally developed index applying the first purchase price method 
we estimate a provision for shrink based on historical cycle count adjustments and periodic physical inventories 
these estimates may vary significantly due to a variety of internal and external factors 
the allowance for damaged goods from returns is estimated based on historical experience 
most items that are returned and slightly damaged are sent to our retail segment  marked down and sold 
we also reserve our inventory for obsolete or slow moving inventory based on inventory aging reports and  in certain cases  by specific identification of slow moving or obsolete inventory 
the aged inventory is grouped and analyzed in various categories  with particular attention given to fashion sensitive categories 
all categories that are subject to obsolescence are reserved for based upon management s estimates  which estimates reflect past experience and management s assessment of future merchandising trends 
our most fashion sensitive categories of merchandise are apparel and footwear 
however  a significant percentage of our inventory has a low fashion component  such as hunting  camping  and fishing gear 
slow moving inventory is marked down and sold in the bargain cave section of our merchandising business 
catalog amortization prepaid catalog expenses consist of internal and third party incremental direct costs incurred in the development  production and circulation of our direct mail catalogs 
these costs are primarily composed of creative design  prepress production  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs relating to the catalogs 
all such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit or twelve months  whichever is shorter 
such amortization is based upon sales lag pattern forecasts  which are developed using similar prior catalog offerings as a guide 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability at each reporting period by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to actual sales data and to the estimated probable remaining future revenue net revenue less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog completions costs associated with that catalog 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated probable remaining future revenue  the excess is expensed in the reporting period 
at the end of fiscal years and  we had million and million  respectively  capitalized for catalog costs 
economic development bonds debt and equity securities with readily determinable fair values are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses  net of related income taxes  excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
declines in the fair value of available for sale securities below cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
at the time we purchase these bonds we make estimates of the discounted future cash flow streams they are expected to generate in the form of interest and principal payments 
because these cash flows are based primarily on future property or sales tax collections at our facilities and other facilities which in many cases may not yet be operating  these estimates are inherently subjective and the probability of ultimate realization is highly uncertain 
any excess of par value over fair value of bonds acquired as part of the destination retail store construction are allocated to the basis of the store 
each reporting period we review the assumptions underlying the recorded valuation of these bonds to determine whether changes in actual or anticipated tax collections or other factors suggest that the bonds have become permanently impaired 
future property tax revenue is estimated using management s current knowledge and assessment of known construction projects and the likelihood of additional development or land sales at the relevant sites 
future sales tax revenue is estimated generally using historical same store sales and projected increases for similar retail stores 
any declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale bonds and securities below cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
gains and losses on the sales of securities are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method 
asset securitization we use securitization of our credit card loans as one source to meet our funding needs for our financial services business 
we account for our securitization transactions in accordance with fas when we securitize credit card loans  we retain certain interests in the loans  including an interest only strip receivable  transferor s interest  servicing rights  and in some cases cash reserve accounts and class b securities 
the interest only strip receivable represents the contractual right to receive from the trust interest and other revenue less certain costs over the estimated life of the securitized loans 
the most significant estimates of the bank related to the interest only strips on the securitized loans 
we estimate the fair value of the interest only strip receivable based on the present value of expected future revenue flows excess spread based upon certain assumptions and estimates of our management 
quoted market prices for the interest only strip receivable are not available and we have limited experience in performing this type of valuation 
our assumptions and estimates include projections concerning interest income and late fees on securitized loans  recoveries on charged off securitized loans  gross credit losses on securitized loans  contractual servicing fees and the interest rate paid to investors in a securitization transaction 
these projections are used to determine the excess spread we expect to earn over the estimated life of the securitized loan principal 
the other assumptions and estimates we use in estimating the fair value of the interest only strip receivable include projected loan payment rates  which are used to determine the estimated life of the securitized loan principal  and an appropriate discount rate 
the assumptions and estimates used to estimate the fair value of the interest only strip receivable at each reporting period reflects management s judgment as to the expected excess spread to be earned and payment rates to be experienced on the securitized loans 
these estimates are likely to change in the future  as the individual components of the excess spread and payment rates are sensitive to market and economic conditions 
for example  the rates paid to investors in our securitization transactions are primarily variable rates subject to change based on changes in market interest rates 
changes in market interest rates can also affect the projected interest income on securitized loans  as we could reprice the portfolio as a result of changes in market conditions 
credit loss projections could change in the future based on changes in the credit quality of the securitized loans  our account management and collection practices  and general economic conditions 
payment rates could fluctuate based on general economic conditions and competition 
actual and expected changes in these factors may result in future estimates of the excess spread and payment rates being materially different from the estimates used in the periods covered by this report 
on a quarterly basis  we review and adjust as appropriate  the assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the interest only strip receivable recognized in connection with our securitization transactions 
if these assumptions change  or actual results differ from projected results  the interest only strip receivable and securitization income would be affected 
if management had made different assumptions for the periods covered by this report that raised or lowered the excess spread or payment rate  our financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
note to our audited consolidated financial statements provides further detail regarding the assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the interest only strip receivable and its sensitivities to adverse changes 
impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted the provisions of fas no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense in the financial statements for all share based payment awards to employees and directors including employee stock option awards and employee stock purchases under an employee stock purchase plan 
we adopted fas r using the modified prospective transition method  therefore  prior fiscal year amounts will not be restated 
under this method  in accordance with the provisions of fas r  we are recognizing compensation expense for i equity awards issued after january   based on grant date estimated fair value on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award  and b all awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the cumulative effect of the adoption of fas r related to estimating forfeitures of outstanding awards was not significant 
in addition to the recognition of expense in the consolidated financial statements  fas r also requires that the cash retained resulting from tax deductions in excess of the cumulative compensation cost recognized for share based arrangements be presented as a financing activity inflow in the consolidated statements of cash flows on a prospective basis 
as a result of the adoption of fas r  our consolidated net income for fiscal year includes compensation expense of approximately million million after tax  or 
per diluted share 
this share based compensation expense is recorded as a component of selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of income 
for fiscal  the excess tax benefit from stock option exercises totaling is presented in financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
prior to january   as permitted by fas  accounting for stock based compensation fas  we accounted for stock based payments under the provisions of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations we also had adopted the disclosure only provisions of fas  whereby we disclosed the pro forma net income and earnings per share as if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions to its share based payment awards 
in fiscal  sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab became effective for the company

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our bank s operations and  to a lesser extent  through our merchandising operations 
we also are exposed to foreign currency risk through our merchandising operations 
financial services interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to changes in earnings or the net present value of assets and off balance sheet positions less liabilities termed economic value of equity due to interest rate changes 
to the extent that interest income collected on managed loans and interest expense do not respond equally to changes in interest rates  or that rates do not change uniformly  securitization earnings and economic value of equity could be affected 
our net interest income on managed credit card loans is affected primarily by changes in short term interest rate indices such as libor and prime rate 
the variable rate credit card loans are indexed to the prime rate 
securitization certificates and notes are indexed to libor based rates of interest and are periodically repriced 
certificate of deposits are priced at the current prevailing market rate at the time of issuance 
we manage and mitigate our interest rate sensitivity through several techniques  but primarily by modifying the contract terms with our cardholders  including interest rates charged  in response to changing market conditions 
additional techniques we use include managing the maturity  repricing and distribution of assets and liabilities by issuing fixed rate securitization certificates and notes and by entering into interest rate swaps to hedge our fixed rate exposure from interest strips 
the table below shows the mix of account balances at each interest rate at fiscal year end  and fiscal year as a percentage of total balances outstanding balances carrying interest rate based upon the national prime lending rate balances carrying an interest rate of balances carrying an interest rate of balances not carrying interest because their previous month s balance was paid in full charges on the credit cards issued by our financial services segment are priced at a margin over the defined national prime lending rate  subject to certain interest rate floors  except purchases of cabela s merchandise  certain other charges and balance transfer programs  which are financed at a fixed interest rate of 
no interest is charged if the account is paid in full within days of the billing cycle 
management has performed an interest rate gap analysis to measure the effects of the timing of the repricing of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
based on this analysis  we believe that if there had been an immediate basis point  or  increase in the market rates for which our assets and liabilities are indexed during the next twelve months  our projected operating results would not be materially affected 
management also has performed a projected interest rate gap analysis for the same future twelve month period to measure the effects of a change in the spread between the prime interest rate and the libor interest rate 
based on this analysis  we believe that an immediate basis point  or  decrease or increase in this spread would cause a decrease or increase  respectively  of million on the projected pre tax income of our financial services segment over the next twelve months  which could have a material effect on our operating results 
merchandising business interest rate risk one of our economic development bond agreements is priced at a variable interest rate with its base rate tied to the prime rate and adjusted annually in november 
however  portions of these bonds were retired in june and the interest rates were renegotiated 
the remainder of these particular economic development bonds had a balance of million at the end of fiscal we have received notification from the bond trustee that it intends to retire the remainder of this issuance in we expect this issuance to be retired prior to november and therefore do not believe that a decrease in the prime rate will have a material effect on our pre tax income 
the interest payable on our line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt increased  our interest expense and results from operations and cash flows could be materially affected 
foreign currency risk we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the united states in transactions that are primarily us dollar transactions 
a small percentage of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar 
any currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to us 
a decline in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased merchandise costs
