overview design within reach is an integrated multi channel provider of distinctive modern design furnishings and accessories offering products to both residential and commercial customers through three integrated sales channels consisting of our studios  website and phones 
we offer a wide range of products in numerous categories  including chairs  tables  workspace and outdoor furniture  lighting  floor coverings  beds and related accessories  bathroom fixtures  fans and other home and office accessories 
our policy of having products in stock and ready to ship is a departure from the approach taken by many other modern design furnishings retailers  which we believe typically requires customers to wait weeks or months to receive their products 
our business operates on the premise that multiple  integrated sales channels improve customer convenience  reinforce brand awareness  and enhance knowledge of our product  and our customers often use all of these channels in the course of making a purchase decision 
while our studios are our primary sales vehicle  our website and catalog are focused marketing vehicles and tools for building brand awareness and educating the customer about our products and designers 
the furniture buying process can be a lengthy one  especially in the luxury segment that dwr occupies 
this often requires the customer to contact us multiple times before making a purchase 
we believe the seamless connection among our studios  website and catalog help to facilitate this process 
we believe the fact that many of our studio proprietors and sales executives are educated in design and have design related experience provides a better customer experience and helps to drive sales 
we have experienced significant growth in customers and sales since our founding in we began selling products through the phone and online in the second half of  and we opened our first studio in november we base our decisions on where to open new studios by categorizing markets into tiers based on household population statistics and supporting sales data collected from our other sales channels 
we opened the majority of our new studios in markets in our top two tiers during fiscal year although most of our studios have been open less than three full years  our experience indicates that studio openings significantly improve our overall market penetration rates in the markets in which they are located 
in addition  we have seen our online sales increase in markets where we have studios compared to markets where we do not have studios 

table of contents in recent years  we have continued to increase sales as our studio base grows  studios have increased in number from one at the end of to studios and one outlet operating in states and the district of columbia as of december  during fiscal  we opened seven studios and one outlet 
we expect to open between three to four new studios in fiscal  in major and smaller urban markets 
all of our sales channels utilize a single common inventory held at our hebron  kentucky fulfillment center 
because we don t offer a cash and carry option in our studios  we are able to more fully utilize selling space and avoid the operational issues that often arise with stock balancing and store replenishment 
we currently source our products primarily in the us and europe 
in  we purchased approximately of our product inventories from manufacturers in foreign countries  of our product inventory purchases were paid for in euros 
although we put a hedging strategy in place to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations during the fourth quarter of  we have not been satisfied with the results of this strategy 
the final hedge contract under this arrangement was settled in july we plan to increase our efforts to develop products internally and include more exclusive items in our mix  and in doing so  we will strive to source products in other parts of the world including latin america and asia where product costs are expected to be lower 
however  we believe this will not begin to favorably impact our product margins until fiscal year in may  we converted our then existing information technology systems to new  custom built systems supporting our product sourcing  merchandise planning  forecasting  inventory management  product distribution and transportation and price management 
these information technology systems also are used to generate information for our financial reporting 
we encountered problems with the conversion  due in large part to the absence of rigorous testing of the new systems prior to implementation 
in particular  the new systems do not contain mechanisms to automatically identify and correct or reject erroneous or incomplete data 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we hired a consulting firm to assess the inadequacies of the system 
as a result of that review process  we plan to replace the existing system  as discussed below 
our existing system cost us approximately million and the net book value was approximately  as of december  we accelerated depreciation of the system during the third quarter of fiscal year such that the imarc system will be fully depreciated when the new system is implemented 
the impact of this change resulted in additional depreciation expense in fiscal year and of approximately million and  respectively 
the impact of this change is anticipated to be an expense of approximately  in fiscal year these amounts will reduce net income or increase net losses 
during the first quarter of  we undertook a process to clearly define and document the requirements for the new system 
during the second quarter of  we finalized the high level specifications for the new system  selected a software vendor  hired a consulting firm to assist with implementation  and began the process of customizing  configuring  testing and installing the new system 
we currently expect to complete the installation of the new system in on july   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
of the shares offered   were sold by us and  were sold by selling stockholders 
we raised net proceeds of million in our initial public offering  net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
on march   we completed a public offering of  shares of common stock at per share 
of the shares offered   were offered by us and  were offered by selling stockholders 
we raised net proceeds of  in this public offering  net of underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are 
table of contents not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our critical accounting policies and estimates are set forth below 
we operate on a or week fiscal year  which ends on the saturday closest to december each fiscal year consists of four week quarters  with an extra week added onto the fourth quarter every five to six years 
our fiscal year ended on december   the fiscal year ended on december  and our fiscal year ended on january  fiscal years and consisted of weeks and fiscal year consisted of weeks 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue on the date on which it estimates that the product has been received by the customer 
the company records as deferred revenue any sales made in the last week of the reporting period for which it estimates delivery in the following period 
the company uses third party freight carrier information to estimate standard delivery times to various locations throughout the united states 
sales are recorded net of expected returns by customers 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with determining net sales recognized in any accounting period 
the company s management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period revenue 
the company analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer demand and acceptance of products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and other allowances in any accounting period 
the returns allowance is recorded as a reduction to net sales for the estimated retail value of the projected product returns and as a reduction in cost of sales for the corresponding cost amount less any reserve for estimated scrap 
reserve for estimated product returns were approximately  and  as of december  and december   respectively 
inventory 
inventory consists primarily of finished goods purchased from third party manufacturers and estimated inbound freight costs 
inventory on hand is carried at a computed average cost which approximates a first in first out method and the lower of cost or market 
we write down inventory for estimated damage equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions or demand for our products are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
although our actual inventory write downs historically have not differed materially from estimated inventory write downs  in the future  actual inventory write downs may differ materially from our reserves 
as a result  our operating results and financial condition could be affected adversely 
as of december  and december   inventory reserves amounted to approximately million and million  respectively 
inventory in transit 
we record inventory in transit based upon shipping terms  estimated lead times from our vendors to our freight forwarders as well as purchase order amounts 
actual amounts shipped could differ from our estimates due to transit times as well as partial shipments due to shortages or backorders 
inventory in transit was million as of december  and million as of december  accrued freight 
we estimate inbound and outbound freight costs based upon an analysis and review of our historical freight costs 
these costs may vary due to the actual weight and size of the product shipped as well as added fuel surcharges 
stock based compensation 
in the first quarter  we adopted the modified prospective method for valuing stock options we grant in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r 
under sfas r  we recognized million of compensation expense related to stock options and employee stock purchases in fiscal stock based compensation expense is classified in selling  general and administrative expenses 
we calculate the value of each employee stock option  estimated on the date of grant  using the black scholes model 
the following assumptions are used in the model a blended volatility rate using a combination of historical stock price and market implied volatility for traded and quoted options on the equities for the group of retail companies for which exchange traded options are observed  a risk free interest rate based upon the average daily closing rates during the quarter for us 
table of contents treasury notes that have a life which approximates the expected life of the option  a dividend yield based on historical and expected dividend payouts  an expected life of employee stock options based on the simplified method allowed by sab and a forfeiture rate based on historical data 
we estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
prior to adopting sfas r  we recorded deferred stock based compensation charges in the amount by which the exercise prices of certain options were less than the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant under the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by the provisions of accounting principles board apb statement no 
accounting for income taxes 
the company will need to generate future taxable income of approximately million  and million to realize federal and state net operating losses  respectively 
the company anticipates generating future taxable income by improving gross margin by utilizing reliable inventory costing information to better align sales prices with related products costs  improving the management and monitoring of inventory returns  and elimination of less profitable product lines 
additionally  the company anticipates better aligning operating costs with sales levels and reducing the large volume of consulting costs incurred during fiscal and as a result of significant systems issues and employee turnover 
we record an estimated valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or a part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company has provided a valuation allowance to the extent that its deferred tax assets are deemed not realizable 
advertising costs 
prepaid catalog costs consist of third party costs  including paper  printing  postage  name acquisition and mailing costs  for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog costs and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual sales to the total of actual and estimated future sales on an individual catalog basis 
the period of expected future benefit is calculated based on our projections of when approximately of sales generated by the catalog will be made 
based on data we have collected  we historically have estimated that catalogs have a period of expected future benefit of two to four months 
the period of expected future benefit of our catalogs could decrease if we were to publish new catalogs more frequently in each year  or could increase if we published them less frequently 
prepaid catalog costs are evaluated for realizability at the end of each reporting period by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future net benefit associated with that catalog 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the estimated probable remaining future net benefit of the catalog  the excess is expensed in the reporting period 
we account for consideration received from our vendors for co operative advertising as a reduction of selling  general and administrative expense 
co operative advertising amounts received from such vendors were approximately   and  in  and  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
long lived assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
if such review indicates that the carrying amount of long lived assets is not recoverable  the carrying amount of such assets is reduced to fair value 
management considers the following circumstances and events to assess the recoverability of carrying amounts a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which long lived assets are being used or in its physical condition  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  the long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of 
table of contents significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
decisions to close a studio or facility also can result in accelerated depreciation over the revised useful life 
when we close a location that is under a long term lease  we record a charge for the fair value of the liability associated with that lease at the cease use date 
the fair value of such liability is calculated based on the remaining lease rental payments due under the lease  reduced by estimated rental payments that could be reasonably obtained by us for subleasing the property to a third party 
the estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by factors such as future studio profitability  real estate demand and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
if the undiscounted future cash flows from the long lived assets are less than the carrying value  a loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of the assets 
derivative and hedging activities 
we record derivatives  particularly cash flow hedges for foreign currency  at fair value on our balance sheet  including embedded derivatives 
we account for foreign currency option contracts on a monthly basis by recognizing the net cash settlement gain or loss on the call or put option in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and adjusting the carrying amount of the contract to market by recognizing any corresponding gain or loss in cost of goods sold as the underlying inventory which was hedged is sold in each reporting period 
our derivative positions were used only to manage identified exposures 
management evaluates our hedges for effectiveness at the time they are designated as well as throughout the hedge period 
with respect to any derivative that is deemed ineffective  the ineffective portion is reported through earnings 
management evaluates the ineffectiveness of outstanding contracts when it is probable that the original forecasted transaction will change 
the effective portion of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in other comprehensive income loss and is recognized in cost of sales when the underlying inventory is sold 
we recorded approximately  and  for ineffectiveness in and  respectively 
there were no amounts recorded for ineffectiveness in results of operations net sales and other data 
the following table sets forth information for fiscal years  and about our net sales by sales channel  total net sales  gross margin  operating expenses  earnings loss from operations  other income expense  net  income tax expense benefit and net earnings loss both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales

table of contents the following table provides information for fiscal years  and about the number of studios open at the end of each fiscal period  the number of catalogs circulated during each fiscal period  the number of online sessions during each fiscal period and the average order value during each fiscal period 
fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year number of studios and outlets open at end of fiscal period number of catalogs circulated number of online sessions average order value comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year net sales 
net sales consist of studio sales  online sales  phone sales  other sales and shipping and handling fees  net of actual and estimated returns by customers 
studio sales consist of sales of merchandise to customers at our studios  online sales consist of sales of merchandise from orders placed through our website  phone sales consist of sales of merchandise through the toll free numbers associated with our printed catalogs  and other sales consist of warehouse sales  outlet sales and sales made by our business development executives to commercial customers 
warehouse sales consist of periodic clearance sales at our fulfillment center of product samples and products that customers have returned 
outlet sales consist of sales at our outlet of product samples  returned product from our customers and to a lesser degree full price product 
shipping and handling fees consist of amounts we charge customers for the delivery of merchandise 
net sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in the fiscal year the increase in net sales is primarily related to the million increase in studio sales as well as  the million increase in other sales 
the increase in studio sales is primarily attributable to the incremental sales of approximately million generated from twenty three studios opened in fiscal year which operated less than twelve months in fiscal year and approximately million in sales generated from seven studios opened during fiscal year other sales increased million  or  compared to the same period last year 
this increase in other sales is primarily related to sales generated from three warehouse sales held during fiscal year and sales from our outlet which opened at the end of the second quarter of online sales increased million or and phone sales decreased million  or  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year we believe the increase in online sales is due in part to increased online marketing initiatives including search optimization and more strategic use of e mail databases which increased the number of hits on our web site by 
we had studios and one outlet open at the end of fiscal year compared to studios open at the end of fiscal year shipping and handling fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise decreased million  or  to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year  primarily due to the free shipping events in the second and third quarter of fiscal year we expect net sales to continue to increase in fiscal year  as we open additional studios 
we also plan to offer fewer promotions in an effort to improve gross margins  but this approach might harm our net sales and might not result in an increase in gross profit or operating income 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year this increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales is due primarily to the higher costs associated with shipping product from our distribution center as well as a reduction in shipping revenue related to the free shipping promotions in the second and third quarter of fiscal year product related cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales less shipping and handling fees  remained relatively unchanged for fiscal year at compared to for fiscal year we believe that product related cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales less shipping and handling fees is a useful financial measure as it removes the impact of profitability from shipping revenues 
we believe shipping operations do not reflect the core operations of dwr s business and do not represent a profit center 

table of contents under our hedging strategy adopted in the fourth quarter of  and which was in place during fiscal years and  we purchased foreign currency option contracts with maturities of months or less to hedge our currency risk on anticipated purchases of merchandise based on our forecasted demand 
we account for hedging contracts on a monthly basis by recognizing the net cash settlement gain or loss on the call or put option in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and adjusting the carrying amount of the contract to market by recognizing any corresponding gain or loss in cost of goods sold as the underlying inventory which was hedged is sold in each reporting period 
however  when derivative positions exceed identified exposures  such contracts are considered ineffective and reported through earnings loss 
as a result we recorded approximately  in for ineffectiveness during fiscal year although we have a hedging strategy in  we will not be able to eliminate all fluctuations in our cost of goods caused by changes in currency exchange rates 
we are also working to diversify our mix of suppliers to reduce our dependence on euro denominated purchases 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
sg a 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of studio costs  including salaries and studio occupancy costs  costs associated with publishing our catalogs and maintaining our website  and corporate and fulfillment center costs  including salaries and occupancy costs  among others 
fiscal year of net sales fiscal year of net sales change change in millions salaries and benefits occupancy and related expense catalog  advertising and promotion other expenses professional legal  consulting  sox total sg a sg a expenses increased million or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal as a percentage of net sales  sg a expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal these increases are primarily due to the following salaries and benefits increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is partly due to the incremental salary and benefits of million related to the twenty three studios opened in fiscal year which operated less than twelve months in fiscal year and the seven studios and one outlet opened during fiscal  an increase in temporary help and subcontractors of approximately million  stock based compensation and severance costs of approximately million  and million in commissions related to the increase in net sales 
the increase in temporary help as well as subcontractor costs relates in part to temporary staffing for open positions in the company not filled as well as additional temporary help needed to complete special projects 
we expect that these costs will be reduced in but will be offset in part by full time employees 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we recorded compensation expense in fiscal year of approximately million related to stock options and employee stock purchases 
in fiscal year  we recorded approximately million in amortized deferred stock based compensation in accordance with apb occupancy and related expense increased million or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this increase is primarily due to the incremental occupancy costs of approximately million associated with the twenty three studios opened in fiscal year which operated less than twelve months in fiscal year and the seven studios and one outlet opened during fiscal and the increase in depreciation of long lived assets 
depreciation expense increased to approximately million in fiscal year  from approximately million in fiscal year included in the increase in depreciation expense is approximately million in additional depreciation expense related to our information technology systems due to our decision in the fourth quarter to shorten the expected life of the systems  which we plan to replace in fiscal 
table of contents additionally  depreciation expense increased as a result of increases in spending on capital assets associated with the new studios and one outlet opened of approximately  catalog  advertising and promotions expenses decreased approximately million or to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year this decrease is primarily due to the decrease in catalog expenses of approximately million partially offset by an increase in advertising 
during the third quarter we reduced our catalog distribution and began testing select media advertising 
in fiscal year we plan to reduce catalog distribution by approximately compared to fiscal and to increase media advertising 
professional fees increased approximately million primarily due to increases in auditing and accounting fees and professional fees related to sarbanes oxley sox compliance and costs as well as incremental accounting fees associated with the quarterly review by our independent public accountants for the second quarter of fiscal year our independent auditors spent additional time reviewing our reconciliation of the accrued inventory sub ledger and the general ledger for our second quarter as initially disclosed in our august  press release  we were previously unable to complete the reconciliation of a difference between the accrued inventory sub ledger and the general ledger necessary to provide for a timely filing of the second quarterly report on form q 
the difference between the general ledger and the sub ledger arose in connection with the implementation of our imarc inventory and sales system in may and inadequate training of finance personnel with respect to changes in procedures necessitated by the change in systems 
no material adjustment was recorded to our financial statements as a result of this reconciliation 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in future period with studio expansion and growth 
additionally  we anticipate information system expenses to increase in the future as non capitalizable costs related to the implementation of a new computer system increase 
other income expense 
interest income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal our interest income in fiscal years and was generated by interest received on our cash equivalents and investments 
in our investment bearing balances decreased primarily to fund our capital expenditures 
interest expense increased to approximately  in fiscal from  in fiscal  primarily due to a higher amount of short term borrowings under our bank credit facility for working capital purposes and for capital expenditures 
other income decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal in fiscal other income consisted primarily of list rental income of approximately  partially offset by other expenses principally the loss recorded due to the ineffectiveness on our hedging program 
in other income consisted primarily of  received from an early termination of a warehouse lease arrangement at the option of the landlord and  in list rental income which were partially offset by a loss of  due to the our ineffectiveness on our hedging program 
income taxes 
in fiscal we recorded an income tax benefit of million compared to  in fiscal the increase in income tax benefit in fiscal is primarily related to the increase in net loss before tax benefit in fiscal as compared with fiscal we have net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million at december  for federal and state income taxes  respectively 
these net operating loss carryforwards will expire between fiscal years and the effective tax rate for was which varies from the statutory rate primarily due to the effects of state income taxes  stock based compensation and tax exempt income 
comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year net sales 
during fiscal year  net sales increased million  or  to million from million in fiscal year approximately million of this increase was due to increased studio 
table of contents sales  which resulted primarily from opening new studios during fiscal year and the results of a full year of operations from the new studios opened during fiscal year  as well as increased demand for our products in all categories  particularly upholstery and sitting and dining items 
online sales increased in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily due to increased online marketing initiatives including search optimization and more strategic use of email databases which increased the number of hits on our website by 
phone sales decreased by as more customers moved to the web and our studios 
in fiscal year  we conducted several promotional events  including our off sale  founder s letter  and best customer mailing which contributed to our sales growth  but increased our sales discount rate to for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year this resulted in an approximate basis point impact on gross margin 
shipping and handling fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise increased due to an increase in sales volumes 
average order value increased to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the increase in average order value resulted primarily from the increase in studio sales  as we achieve a higher average order value 
in addition  our customer base has grown approximately in fiscal year compared to fiscal year cost of sales 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal year from million in fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  cost of sales increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was primarily a result of changes in the euro spot rate from to  losses from euro hedging contracts entered into in late and operational issues related to product returns 
in fiscal year  we generated all of our net sales in us dollars  but we purchased approximately of our product inventories from manufacturers in europe and paid for approximately of these products in euros 
during fiscal year  the value of the us dollar decreased approximately relative to the euro  which had an adverse effect on our cost of goods and gross margins 
in fiscal year  the value of the dollar increased approximately relative to the euro 
however  we did not benefit significantly from this strengthening of the dollar because we made most of our fiscal year inventory purchases in the first part of the year  when the dollar was still weak relative to the euro  and because we purchased the hedging contracts at a time when the dollar was relatively weak 
in fiscal year  our actual demand was less than our forecasted demand  and the amount of euros we hedged was greater than the amount we needed for purchases of inventory 
as a result  we recorded approximately  for ineffectiveness during fiscal year fiscal year of net sales fiscal year of net sales change change in millions salaries and benefits occupancy and related expense catalog  advertising and promotion other expenses professional legal  consulting  sox total sg a selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in fiscal year  or compared to fiscal year as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal year from in fiscal year the increase has been primarily attributable to increased headcount and occupancy expenses associated with a full year of studios opened in fiscal year and new studios opened in fiscal year headcount increased due to both the studio growth as well as additions to corporate staff to support the company growth 
catalog and marketing increased as we distributed approximately million catalogs in fiscal year compared to million catalogs in fiscal year other expenses increased due to merchant fees as a direct result of sales volume growth  bad debt expense and other corporate expenses as a result of the growth in the business 
the increase in professional and outside service costs was due to sox compliance related fees as well as incremental audit costs incurred due to a full year of being a public company

the majority of the increase in net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year compared to the net cash used in operating activities in fiscal year results from the smaller increase in inventory in fiscal year in fiscal year inventory increased million as compared with an increase of million in inventory in fiscal year in fiscal year inventory levels increased to support additional sales as well as the new studios opened during the year

fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we completed our assessment of fin and determined that the adoption of fin will not have a material impact on our results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 
this statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after september  we believe adoption of sfas will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement  fair value measurements fas 
this statement clarifies the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and require expanded financial statement disclosures about fair value measurements for assets and liabilities 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact on our financial statements 
in september  the sec s office of the chief accountant and divisions of corporation finance and investment management released staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides interpretive guidance on how registrants should quantify financial statement misstatements 
currently  the two methods most commonly used by preparers and auditors to quantify misstatements are the rollover method which focuses primarily on the income statement impact of misstatements and the iron curtain method which focuses primarily on the balance sheet impact of misstatements 
under sab  registrants will be required to consider both the rollover and iron curtain methods ie  a dual approach when evaluating the materiality of financial statement errors 
registrants will need to revisit their prior materiality assessments and consider them using both the rollover and iron curtain methods 
sab is effective for annual financial statements in the first fiscal year ending after november  the sab provides transition accounting and disclosure guidance for situations in which a registrant concludes that a material error s existed in prior period financial statements under the dual 
table of contents approach 
specifically  registrants will be permitted to restate prior period financial statements or recognize the cumulative effect of initially applying sab through an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption 
adoption of sab did not have a material impact on our annual financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensuses reached by the emerging issues task force eitf in issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
eitf requires disclosure of an entity s accounting policy regarding the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer including sales  use  value added and some excise taxes 
we present such taxes on a net basis excluded from net sales 
we believe adoption of eitf  which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no

permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
a business entity will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings or another performance indicator if the business entity does not report earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option a may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  management is currently evaluating the effect that adoption of this statement will have on our financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk net investment risk in fiscal year  we generated all of our net sales in us dollars  but we purchased approximately of our product inventories from manufacturers in europe and paid for approximately of these products in euros 
increases and decreases in the us dollar relative to the euro result in fluctuations in the cost to us of merchandise sourced from europe 
as a result of such currency fluctuations  we have experienced and may continue to experience fluctuations in our operating results on an annual and a quarterly basis going forward 
specifically  as the value of the us dollar declines relative to the euro  our effective cost of supplies of product increases 
as a result  declines in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and other foreign currencies would increase our cost of goods sold and decrease our gross margin 
in fiscal year  the value of the dollar increased approximately relative to the euro 
however  we did not benefit significantly from this strengthening of the dollar because we made most of our fiscal year inventory purchases in the first part of the year when the dollar was still weak relative to the euro and because of the hedging contracts we purchased at a time when the dollar was relatively weak 
during the second part of the year  we ceased purchasing hedging contracts and conducted our currency transactions on the spot market 
during  we have begun purchasing foreign currency forward contracts with maturities of months or less to hedge our foreign currency risk on anticipated purchases of merchandise based on purchase orders outstanding 
in fiscal we accounted for hedging contracts on a monthly basis by recognizing the net cash settlement gain or loss on the call or put option in accumulated other comprehensive income loss and adjusting the carrying amount of the contract to market by recognizing any corresponding gain or loss in cost of goods sold as the underlying inventory which was hedged was sold in each reporting period 
however  when derivative 
table of contents positions exceed identified exposures  such contracts are considered ineffective and reported through earnings loss 
in fiscal year  our actual demand was less than our forecasted demand  and the amount of euros we hedged was greater than the amount we needed for purchases of inventory 
as a result  we recorded approximately  for ineffectiveness during fiscal year if our anticipated purchases exceed actual purchases  we may continue to have expenses associated with hedging that are not associated with inventory purchases 
if our hedging strategy does not help reduce fluctuations in our cost of goods and mitigate the impact of strengthening of the euro relative to the us dollar  we will continue to have difficulties in accurately predicting our costs of goods and our cost of goods may increase  adversely impacting our gross margin 
interest rate risk we have interest payable on our operating line of credit 
amounts borrowed under this line of credit bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lender s prime lending rate 
the extent of this risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and the future financing requirements 
as of december   no borrowings were outstanding under this facility
