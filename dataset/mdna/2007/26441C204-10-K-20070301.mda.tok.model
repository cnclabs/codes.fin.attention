item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
introduction management s discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes for the years ended december   and executive overview objectives 
duke energy s objectives for  as outlined in the charter  consisted of the following establish an industry leading electric power platform through successful execution of the merger with cinergy  deliver on the financial objectives and position duke energy for growth in and beyond  complete the exit of the former dena business and pursue strategic portfolio opportunities  build a high performance culture focused on safety  diversity and inclusion  employee development  leadership and results  and build credibility through leadership on key policy issues  transparent communications and excellent customer service 
during  management executed on its objectives primarily through strategically completed and pending acquisitions  as well as dispositions of certain businesses with higher risk profiles  such as the former dena operations outside the midwest and the cinergy commercial marketing and trading businesses 
during  duke energy created a business model that would give both duke energy s electric and gas businesses stand alone strength and additional scope and scale along with steady and stable earnings growth 
on april   duke energy and cinergy consummated the previously announced merger  which combined the duke energy and cinergy regulated franchises as well as deregulated generation in the midwestern united states 
the merger with cinergy increased the size and scope of duke energy s electric utility operations 
duke energy management expects to achieve numerous synergies  both immediately and over time  in all regions impacted by the merger 
as a result of the additional size and scope of the electric utility operations discussed above  in june  the board of directors of duke energy authorized management to pursue a plan to create two separate publicly traded companies by spinning off duke energy s natural gas businesses to duke energy shareholders  which was completed on january  the new natural gas company  spectra energy  consists of duke energy s natural gas transmission business segment  including union gas  as well as duke energy s percent ownership interest in defs 
the spin off of the natural gas business is expected to deliver long term value to shareholders as the two stand alone companies are expected to be able to more easily participate in growth opportunities in their own industries as well as the gas and power industry consolidations 
in connection with the effort to reduce the risk profile of duke energy and to focus on businesses that can be expected to contribute steady  stable earnings growth  during duke energy finalized the sale of the former dena power generation fleet outside of the midwest to ls power and the sale of the cinergy commercial marketing and trading business to fortis  a benelux based financial services group fortis 
additionally  the board of directors of duke energy authorized management to explore the potential value of bringing in a joint venture partner at crescent to expand the business and create a platform for increased growth 
on september   an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of duke energy closed an agreement to create the crescent jv with ms members 
as a result of the crescent transaction  duke energy no longer controls the crescent jv and on september  deconsolidated its investment in crescent and subsequently accounts for its investment in the crescent jv utilizing the equity method of accounting 
after completion of the spin off of the natural gas businesses  the primary businesses remaining in duke energy in are the us franchised electric and gas business segment  the commercial power business segment  the international energy business segment and duke energy s effective interest in the crescent jv  which management currently expects to continue to be a reportable business segment 
duke energy announced an agreement with southern company to evaluate the potential construction of a new nuclear power plant at a site jointly owned in cherokee county  south carolina 
additionally  duke energy continues to evaluate other opportunities to re invest in the electric utility operations  by modernizing older coal fired plants in the carolinas and exploring the replacement of an aging coal plant in indiana with a coal gasification plant 
also  during the fourth quarter of  duke energy closed on a transaction to acquire from dynegy a megawatt power plant located in rockingham county  north carolina 
this peaking plant  which will primarily be used during times of high electricity demand  generally in the winter and summer months  will provide customers with competitively priced peaking capacity and helps to ensure duke energy can meet growing customer demands for electricity in the foreseeable future 
additionally  in 
table of contents part ii december duke energy entered into an agreement to increase its ownership interest in the catawba nuclear station for a purchase price of approximately million 
the purchase is subject to regulatory approvals and other conditions precedent and is expected to close prior to september  effective with the third quarter  the board of directors of duke energy approved a quarterly dividend increase of per share  increasing the annual dividend to per share 
additionally  during duke energy repurchased approximately million shares of its common stock for approximately million 
in connection with the above mentioned plan to spin off duke energy s natural gas businesses to duke energy shareholders  the share repurchase program was suspended 
in october  duke energy s board of directors authorized the reactivation of the share repurchase plan for duke energy of up to million of share repurchases subsequent to the spin off of the natural gas businesses on january  financial results 
for the year ended december   duke energy reported earnings available for common stockholders of  million and basic and diluted earnings per share eps of and  respectively  as compared to reported earnings available for common stockholders of  million and basic and diluted eps of and  respectively  for the year ended december  earnings available for common stockholders for as compared to were fairly flat  however  basic and diluted eps were negatively impacted by the issuance of approximately million shares in april in connection with the cinergy merger 
the highlights for include the following us franchised electric and gas experienced higher earnings in primarily as a result of the addition of the former cinergy regulated utility operations in the midwest 
these higher results were partially offset by milder weather  the impact of rate reductions related to cinergy merger approvals  and lower bulk power marketing results in the carolinas 
natural gas transmission s results were flat from to  but were affected by strong commodity prices related to processing activities and higher operating and maintenance expenses 
field services experienced lower earnings in primarily as a result of the gains on the sale of the teppco investments and the transfer of a percent interest in defs to conocophillips in july  which resulted in the deconsolidation of the investment in defs 
results in were favorably affected by strong commodity prices 
commercial power experienced higher earnings in primarily as a result of the addition of the former cinergy non regulated generation operations in the midwest  partially offset by the impacts of unfavorable purchase accounting charges as a result of recognizing the cinergy assets and liabilities at their estimated fair values as of the date of merger 
international energy experienced lower earnings in primarily as a result of non cash charges related to a settlement related to the citrus litigation  an impairment charge related to the investment in campeche  and an impairment charge related to the sale of bolivian assets 
crescent experienced higher earnings in primarily as a result of the gain recognized on the joint venture transaction in september  which resulted in the deconsolidation of duke energy s investment in the crescent jv 
other experienced higher losses in primarily as a result of charges related to contract settlement negotiations  and costs to achieve the cinergy merger and the spin off of the natural gas businesses 
income tax expense from continuing operations was lower in as a result of a decrease in earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a reduction in the effective tax rate 
the reduction in the effective tax rate was primarily a result of favorable tax settlements on research and development costs and nuclear decommissioning costs  tax benefits related to the impairment of the investment in bolivia  and tax credits recognized on synthetic fuel operations 
during  duke energy recognized net of tax losses of million in discontinued operations  as compared to net of tax losses of million in during  duke energy completed the exit of the former dena operations outside the midwest region and recognized additional losses as a result of sales of certain contracts 
additionally  during duke energy exited the cinergy commercial marketing and trading business 
objectives 
as a result of the initiatives accomplished during and the spin off of the natural gas businesses on january   duke energy is positioned as a lower risk business with steady earnings growth potential 
for  management of duke energy is focused on the following objectives  as outlined in the charter establish the identity and culture of the new duke energy  unifying its people  values  strategy  processes and systems  optimize its operations by focusing on safety  simplicity  accountability  inclusion  customer satisfaction  cost management and employee development  
table of contents part ii achieve public policy  regulatory and legislative outcomes that balance customers needs for reliable energy at competitive prices with shareholders expectation of superior returns  invest in energy infrastructure that meets rising customer demands for reliable energy in an energy efficient and environmentally sound manner  and achieve financial objectives and position duke energy to meet future growth targets 
duke energy s consolidated earnings during are anticipated to be reduced principally as a result of the spin off of the natural gas businesses on january  excluding the impacts of the spin off of the natural gas businesses  earnings are anticipated to be favorably affected by the following factors a full year of earnings from the midwest operations acquired from cinergy  realization of cost savings as the regulatory rate reductions shared with ratepayers will phase out in  customer sales growth  capital reinvestments and regulatory initiatives 
the majority of expected earnings in are anticipated to be contributed from us franchised electric and gas  which consists of duke energy s regulated businesses operating a net capacity of approximately  megawatts of generation 
the regulated generation portfolio consists of a mix of coal  nuclear  natural gas and hydroelectric generation  with substantially all of the sales of electricity coming from coal and nuclear generation facilities 
commercial power has net capacity of approximately  megawatts of unregulated generation  of which approximately  megawatts serves retail customers under the rate stabilization plan in ohio 
approximately of international energy s net capacity of approximately  megawatts of installed generation capacity in latin america consists of baseload hydroelectric capacity that carries a low level of dispatch risk  in addition  for over of international energy s contractible capacity in latin america is either currently contracted or receives a system capacity payment 
duke energy s total dividends and dividends per share in will be lower than in as a result of the spin off of the natural gas businesses on january  future dividends are expected to grow in connection with any earnings growth 
during the three year period from to  duke energy anticipates annual capital expenditures of approximately billion  for a total of approximately billion 
these expenditures are principally related to expansion plans  environmental spending related to clean air requirements  nuclear fuel  as well as maintenance costs 
current estimates are that duke energy s regulated generation capacity will need to increase by approximately  megawatts over the next ten years  with the majority being in north and south carolina and the remainder being in indiana 
duke energy is committed to adding base load capacity at a reasonable price while modernizing the current generation facilities by replacing older  less efficient plants with cleaner  more efficient plants 
significant expansion projects may include a new igcc plant in indiana  a new coal unit or units at duke energy s existing cliffside facility in north carolina  new gas fired generation units and costs related to the evaluation of the potential construction of a new nuclear power plant in cherokee county  south carolina as well as normal additions due to system growth 
costs related to environmental spending are expected to decrease over the three year period as the upgrades to comply with the new environmental regulations are completed 
duke energy does not anticipate any additional capital investment related to its investment in the crescent jv 
duke energy does not currently anticipate funding capital expenditures with the issuance of common equity  but rather through the use of available cash and cash equivalents as well as the issuance of incremental debt 
as the majority of duke energy s anticipated future capital expenditures are related to its regulated operations  a significant risk to duke energy is the ability to recover in a timely manner costs related to such expansion 
in indiana  duke energy has been given approval to recover its development costs for the new igcc plant 
in north and south carolina  duke energy will pursue legislation to provide for construction work in progress recovery for the additional unit or units at the cliffside facility as well as the proposed nuclear power plant 
additionally  duke energy is attempting to obtain assurance of recovery of development costs related to the proposed nuclear power plant 
duke energy does not anticipate beginning construction of the proposed nuclear power plant without adequate assurance of cost recovery from the state legislators or regulators 
in november  duke energy received approval for nearly million of future federal tax credits related to costs to be incurred for the modernization of the cliffside facility as well as the igcc plant in indiana 
in an effort to respond to concerns over climate change  the us congress recently discussed various proposals to reduce or cap carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 
any legislation enacted as a result of these efforts could involve a market based cap and trade program 
duke energy is also focusing on energy efficiency initiatives in an effort to reduce emissions 
duke energy s current regulatory initiatives primarily include obtaining the timely recovery of invested capital and pursuing a regulatory extension of the rate stabilization plan in ohio through as well as being a proponent of cost effective energy efficiency initiatives 
in north carolina  duke energy is required by june  to file a rate case or show that a price adjustment is not required 
during  duke energy filed for an increase in its base electric rates in kentucky 
in december  the kentucky public service commission approved an annual rate increase of million to be effective january  
table of contents part ii new energy legislation has been introduced in the current south carolina legislative session which includes expansion of the annual fuel clause mechanism to include recovery of costs of reagents ammonia  limestone  etc 
that are consumed in the operation of duke energy carolina s so and nox control technologies 
the legislation also includes provisions to provide cost recovery assurance for upfront development costs associated with nuclear baseload generation  cost recovery assurance for construction costs associated with nuclear or coal baseload generation  and the ability to recover financing costs for new nuclear or coal baseload generation through annual riders 
similar legislation is being discussed in north carolina and may be introduced in the legislative session 
in summary  duke energy is coordinating its future capital expenditure requirements with regulatory initiatives in order to ensure adequate and timely cost recovery while continuing to provide low cost energy to its customers 
economic factors for duke energy s business 
duke energy s business model provides diversification between stable  less cyclical businesses like us franchised electric and gas  and the traditionally higher growth and more cyclical energy businesses like commercial power and international energy 
additionally  crescent s portfolio strategy is diversified between residential  commercial and multi family development 
all of duke energy s businesses can be negatively affected by sustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy  including low market prices of commodities  all of which are beyond duke energy s control  and could impair duke energy s ability to meet its goals for and beyond 
declines in demand for electricity as a result of economic downturns would reduce overall electricity sales and lessen duke energy s cash flows  especially as industrial customers reduce production and  thus  consumption of electricity 
a portion of us franchised electric and gas business risk is mitigated by its regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of fuel costs under fuel adjustment clauses 
if negative market conditions should persist over time and estimated cash flows over the lives of duke energy s individual assets do not exceed the carrying value of those individual assets  asset impairments may occur in the future under existing accounting rules and diminish results of operations 
a change in management s intent about the use of individual assets held for use versus held for sale or a change in fair value of assets held for sale could also result in impairments or losses 
duke energy s goals can also be substantially at risk due to the regulation of its businesses 
duke energy s businesses in the united states are subject to regulations on the federal and state level 
regulations  applicable to the electric power industry  have a significant impact on the nature of the businesses and the manner in which they operate 
changes to regulations are ongoing and duke energy cannot predict the future course of changes in the regulatory environment or the ultimate effect that any future changes will have on its business 
duke energy s earnings are impacted by fluctuations in commodity prices 
exposure to commodity prices generates higher earnings volatility in the unregulated businesses as there are timing differences as to when such costs are recovered in rates 
to mitigate these risks  duke energy enters into derivative instruments to effectively hedge known exposures 
with the sales of former dena s assets outside the midwestern united states  including substantially all the derivative portfolio  and cinergy s marketing and trading operation  duke energy expects a less volatile earnings pattern going forward 
additionally  duke energy s investments and projects located outside of the united states expose duke energy to risks related to laws of other countries  taxes  economic conditions  fluctuations in currency rates  political conditions and policies of foreign governments 
changes in these factors are difficult to predict and may impact duke energy s future results 
duke energy also relies on access to both short term money markets and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not met by cash flow from operations 
an inability to access capital at competitive rates could adversely affect duke energy s ability to implement its strategy 
market disruptions or a downgrade of duke energy s credit rating may increase its cost of borrowing or adversely affect its ability to access one or more sources of liquidity

segment results management evaluates segment performance based on earnings before interest and taxes from continuing operations  after deducting minority interest expense related to those profits ebit 
on a segment basis  ebit excludes discontinued operations  represents all profits from continuing operations both operating and non operating before deducting interest and taxes  and is net of the minority interest expense related to those profits 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are managed centrally by duke energy  so the gains and losses on foreign currency remeasurement  and interest and dividend income on those balances  are excluded from the segments ebit 
management considers segment ebit to be a good indicator of each segment s operating performance from its continuing operations  as it represents the results of duke energy s ownership interest in operations without regard to financing methods or capital structures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  business segments  for a discussion of duke energy s new segment structure 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  discontinued operations and assets held for sale during the third quarter of  the board of directors of duke energy authorized and directed management to execute the sale or disposition of substantially all former dena s remaining assets and contracts outside the midwestern united states and certain contractual positions related to the midwestern assets 
as a result of this exit plan  the continuing operations of the former dena segment which primarily include the operations of the midwestern generation assets  former dena s remaining southeastern operations related to assets which were disposed of in  the remaining operations of detm  and certain general and administrative costs have been reclassified to commercial power  except for detm  which is in other

year ended december  as compared to december  operating revenues 
the increase was driven primarily by a  million increase in regulated revenues due to the acquisition of cinergy a million increase in fuel revenues driven by increased fuel rates for retail customers due primarily to increased coal costs 
the delivered cost of coal in is approximately per ton higher than the same period in  representing an approximately increase  and a million increase related to demand from retail customers  due primarily to continued growth in the number of residential and general service customers in duke energy carolinas service territory 
the number of customers in increased by approximately  compared to partially offsetting these increases were a million decrease in wholesale power sales  net of the impact of sharing of profits from wholesale power sales with industrial customers in north carolina million 
sales volumes decreased by approximately primarily due to production constraints caused by generation outages and pricing a million decrease related to the sharing of anticipated merger savings by way of a rate decrement rider with regulated customers in north carolina and south carolina 
as a requirement of the merger  duke energy carolinas is required to share anticipated merger savings of approximately million with north carolina customers and approximately million with south carolina customers over a one year period  and a million decrease in gwh sales to retail customers due to unfavorable weather conditions compared to the same period in weather statistics in for heating degree days were approximately below normal as compared to above normal in overall weather statistics for both heating and cooling periods in were unfavorable compared to the same periods in operating expenses 
the increase was driven primarily by a  million increase in regulated operating expenses due to the acquisition of cinergy a million increase in fuel expenses  due primarily to higher coal costs 
fossil generation fueled by coal accounted for slightly more than of total generation for year to date december  and and the delivered cost of coal in is approximately per ton higher than the same period in a million increase in purchased power expense  due primarily to less generation availability during as a result of outages at base load stations  and a million increase in depreciation expense  due to additional capital spending 
partially offsetting these increases were an million decrease in regulatory amortization  due to reduced amortization of compliance costs related to clean air legislation during as compared to the same period in regulatory amortization expenses were approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million during the same period in a million decrease in operating and maintenance expenses  due primarily to a december ice storm  and a million decrease in donations related to sharing of profits from wholesale power sales with charitable  educational and economic development programs in north carolina and south carolina

table of contents part ii other income and expenses 
the increase in other income and expenses resulted primarily from an increase in allowance for funds used during construction due mainly to the acquisition of the regulated operations of cinergy 
ebit 
the increase in ebit resulted primarily from the acquisition of the regulated operations of cinergy  lower regulatory amortization in north carolina  increased demand from retail customers due to continued growth in the number of residential and general service customers and decreased operating and maintenance expense in the carolinas 
these changes were partially offset by lower wholesale power sales  net of sharing  rate reductions due to the merger  unfavorable weather conditions and increased purchased power expense in the carolinas 
matters impacting future us franchised electric and gas results us franchised electric and gas continues to increase its customer base  maintain low costs and deliver high quality customer service in the carolinas and midwest 
the residential and general service sectors are expected to grow 
us franchised electric and gas will continue to provide strong cash flows from operations to duke energy 
changes in weather  wholesale power market prices  service area economy  generation availability and changes to the regulatory environment would impact future financial results for us franchised electric and gas 
rate reductions for merger savings will primarily cease in the second quarter of in addition  us franchised electric and gas results will be affected by its flexibility to vary the amortization expenses associated with the north carolina clean air legislation 
us franchised electric and gas amortization expense related to this clean air legislation totals million from inception  with million recorded in and million recorded in at least million of amortization will be recognized in in order to recognize the minimum cumulative amortization of approximately billion required by the end of various regulatory activities will continue in  including a north carolina rate review and filings for certification for new generation and approval of various costs to be recovered in trackers 
the outcomes of these matters will impact future earnings and cash flows for us franchised electric and gas 
as a result of additional costs and synergies that are expected from the merger with cinergy as well as the uncertainty related to the regulatory activities mentioned above  us franchised electric and gas is unable to estimate reported segment ebit for and beyond 
however  segment ebit for is expected to be higher than in primarily due to a full year of contributions from cinergy s regulated operations and the expectation for more normalized weather in us franchised electric and gas service territories

duke energy has identified a number of critical accounting policies and estimates that require the use of significant estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on other various assumptions that they believe are reasonable at the time of application 
the estimates and judgments may change as time passes and more information about duke energy s environment becomes available 
if estimates and judgments are different than the actual amounts recorded  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to take into consideration the new information 
duke energy discusses its critical accounting policies and estimates and other significant accounting policies with senior members of management and the audit committee  as appropriate 
duke energy s critical accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
regulatory accounting duke energy accounts for certain of its regulated operations primarily us franchised electric and gas and natural gas transmission under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
as a result  duke energy records assets and liabilities that result from the regulated ratemaking process that would not be recorded under gaap for non regulated entities 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for previous collections for 
table of contents part ii costs that either are not likely to or have yet to be incurred 
management continually assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as applicable regulatory environment changes  recent rate orders to other regulated entities  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
based on this continual assessment  management believes the existing regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
this assessment reflects the current political and regulatory climate at the state  provincial and federal levels  and is subject to change in the future 
if future recovery of costs ceases to be probable  the asset write offs would be required to be recognized in operating income 
additionally  the regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property  plant and equipment  nuclear decommissioning costs and amortization of regulatory assets

long lived asset impairments and assets held for sale duke energy evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets  excluding goodwill  when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable 
for long lived assets  impairment would exist when the carrying value exceeds the sum of estimates of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the asset is impaired  the asset s carrying value is adjusted to its estimated fair value 
when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration  a probability weighted approach is used for developing estimates of future cash flows 
duke energy uses the best information available to estimate fair value of its long lived assets and may use more than one source 
judgment is exercised to estimate the future cash flows  the useful lives of long lived assets and to determine management s intent to use the assets 
the sum of undiscounted cash flows is primarily dependent on forecasted commodity prices for sales of power or natural gas costs of fuel over periods of time consistent with the useful lives of the assets or changes in the real estate market 
management s intent to use or dispose of assets is subject to re evaluation and can change over time 
a change in duke energy s plans regarding  or probability assessments of  holding or selling an asset could have a significant impact on the estimated future cash flows 
duke energy considers various factors when determining if impairment tests are warranted  including but not limited to significant adverse changes in legal factors or in the business climate  a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating or cash flow losses  or a projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of a long lived asset  an accumulation of costs significantly in excess of the amount originally expected for the acquisition or construction of a long lived asset  significant adverse changes in the extent or manner in which an asset is used or in its physical condition or a change in business strategy  a significant change in the market value of an asset  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  an asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life 
judgment is also involved in determining the timing of meeting the criteria for classification as an asset held for sale under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
during and  duke energy recorded impairments on several of its long lived assets 
for discussion of these impairments  see note to the consolidated financial statements  impairments  severance and other charges 
duke energy may dispose of certain other assets in addition to the assets classified as held for sale at december  accordingly  based in part on current market conditions in the merchant energy industry  it is reasonably possible that duke energy s current estimate of fair value of its long lived assets being considered for sale at december  and its other long lived assets  could change and that change may impact the consolidated results of operations 
in addition  duke energy could decide to dispose of additional assets in future periods  at prices that could be less than the book value of the assets 
duke energy uses the criteria in sfas no 
and eitf  applying the conditions in paragraph of fas in determining whether to report discontinued operations  to determine whether components of duke energy that are being disposed of or are classified as held for sale are required to be reported as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
to qualify as a discontinued operation under sfas no 
 the component being disposed of must have clearly distinguishable operations and cash 
table of contents part ii flows 
additionally  pursuant to eitf  duke energy must not have significant continuing involvement in the operations after the disposal ie duke energy must not have the ability to influence the operating or financial policies of the disposed component and cash flows of the assets sold must have been eliminated from duke energy s ongoing operations ie duke energy does not expect to generate significant direct cash flows from activities involving the disposed component after the disposal transaction is completed 
assuming both preceding conditions are met  the related results of operations for the current and prior periods  including any related impairments and gains or losses on sales  are reflected as loss income from discontinued operations  net of tax  in the consolidated statements of operations 
if an asset held for sale does not meet the requirements for discontinued operations classification  any impairments and gains or losses on sales are recorded in continuing operations as gains losses on sales of other assets  net  in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairments for all other long lived assets  other than goodwill  are recorded as impairments and other charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
impairment of goodwill at december  and  duke energy had goodwill balances of  million and  million  respectively 
duke energy evaluates the impairment of goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the majority of duke energy s goodwill at december  relates to the acquisition of cinergy in april  whose assets are primarily included in the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments  and the acquisition of westcoast energy  inc westcoast in march  whose assets are primarily included within the natural gas transmission segment 
the remainder relates to international energy s latin american operations 
as of the acquisition date  duke energy allocates goodwill to a reporting unit  which duke energy defines as an operating segment or one level below an operating segment 
as required by sfas no 
 duke energy performs an annual goodwill impairment test and updates the test if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
key assumptions used in the analysis include  but are not limited to  the use of an appropriate discount rate  estimated future cash flows and estimated run rates of operation  maintenance  and general and administrative costs 
in estimating cash flows  duke energy incorporates expected growth rates  regulatory stability and ability to renew contracts as well as other factors into its revenue and expense forecasts 
as a result of the impairment test required by sfas no 
 duke energy did not record any impairment on its goodwill 
management continues to remain alert for any indicators that the fair value of a reporting unit could be below book value and will assess goodwill for impairment as appropriate 
revenue recognition unbilled and estimated revenues 
revenues on sales of electricity  primarily at us franchised electric and gas  are recognized when the service is provided 
unbilled revenues are estimated by applying an average revenue kilowatt hour for all customer classes to the number of estimated kilowatt hours delivered but not billed 
differences between actual and estimated unbilled revenues are immaterial and are a result of customer mix 
revenues on sales of natural gas  natural gas transportation  storage and distribution as well as sales of petroleum products  primarily at natural gas transmission and field services prior to deconsolidation on july   are recognized when either the service is provided or the product is delivered 
revenues related to these services provided or products delivered but not yet billed are estimated each month 
these estimates are generally based on contract data  regulatory information  estimated distribution usage based on historical data adjusted for heating degree days  commodity prices and preliminary throughput and allocation measurements 
final bills for the current month are billed and collected in the following month 
differences between actual and estimated unbilled revenues are immaterial 
trading and marketing revenues 
the recognition of income in the consolidated statements of operations for derivative activity is primarily dependent on whether the accrual model or mtm model is applied 
while the mtm model is the default method of accounting for all derivatives  sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
allows for the use of the accrual model for derivatives designated as hedges and certain scope exceptions  including the normal purchase and normal sale exception 
duke energy designates a derivative as a hedge or a normal purchase or normal sale contract in accordance with internal hedge guidelines and the requirements provided by sfas no 
for further information regarding the accrual model or mtm model  see risk management accounting below 
for further information regarding the presentation of gains and losses or revenue and expense in the consolidated statements of operations  see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 

table of contents part ii risk management accounting duke energy uses two comprehensive accounting models for its risk management activities in reporting its consolidated financial position and results of operations the mtm model and the accrual model 
as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  the mtm model is applied to trading and undesignated non trading derivative contracts  and the accrual model is applied to derivative contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges  fair value hedges  and normal purchases or sales  as well as to non derivative contracts used for commodity risk management purposes 
for the three years ended december   the determination as to which model was appropriate was primarily based on accounting guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb and the eitf 
under the mtm model  an asset or liability is recognized at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets and the change in the fair value of that asset or liability is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the current period 
while former dena was the primary business segment that used this accounting model  the us franchised electric and gas  commercial power and field services segments  as well as other  have historically had certain transactions subject to this model 
for the years ended december   and  duke energy applied the mtm model to its derivative contracts  unless subject to hedge accounting or the normal purchase and normal sale exemption as described below 
the mtm model is applied within the context of an overall valuation framework 
all new and existing transactions are valued using approved valuation techniques and market data  and discounted using a risk free based interest rate ie london interbank offered rate libor or us treasury rate 
when available  quoted market prices are used to measure a contract s fair value 
however  market quotations for certain energy contracts may not be available for illiquid periods or locations 
if no active trading market exists for a commodity or for a contract s duration  holders of these contracts must calculate fair value using internally developed valuation techniques or models 
key components used in these valuation techniques include price curves  volatility  correlation  interest rates and tenor 
while volatility and correlation are the most subjective components  the price curve is generally the most significant component affecting the ultimate fair value for a contract subject to the mtm model 
prices for illiquid periods or locations are established by extrapolating prices for correlated products  locations or periods 
these relationships are routinely re evaluated based on available market data  and changes in price relationships are reflected in price curves prospectively 
consideration may also be given to the analysis of market fundamentals when developing illiquid prices 
a deviation in any of the components affecting fair value may significantly affect overall fair value 
valuation adjustments for performance and market risk  and administration costs are used to arrive at the fair value of the contract and the gain or loss ultimately recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
while duke energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques  changes in duke energy s pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition 
however  due to the nature and number of variables involved in estimating fair values  and the interrelationships among these variables  sensitivity analysis of the changes in any individual variable is not considered to be relevant or meaningful 
validation of a contract s calculated fair value is performed by an internal group independent of duke energy s deal origination areas 
this group performs pricing model validation  back testing and stress testing of valuation techniques  prices and other variables 
validation of a contract s fair value may be done by comparison to actual market activity and negotiation of collateral requirements with third parties 
for certain derivative instruments  duke energy applies either hedge accounting or the normal purchase and normal sales exemption in accordance with sfas no 
the use of hedge accounting and the normal purchase and normal sales exemption provide effectively for the use of the accrual model 
under this model  there is generally no recognition in the consolidated statements of operations for changes in the fair value of a contract until the service is provided or the associated delivery period occurs settlement 
hedge accounting treatment may be used when duke energy contracts to buy or sell a commodity such as natural gas at a fixed price for future delivery corresponding with anticipated physical sales or purchase of natural gas cash flow hedge 
in addition  hedge accounting treatment may be used when duke energy holds firm commitments or asset positions and enters into transactions that hedge the risk that the price of a commodity  such as natural gas or electricity  may change between the contract s inception and the physical delivery date of the commodity fair value hedge 
to the extent that the fair value of the hedge instrument offsets the transaction being hedged  there is no impact to the consolidated statements of operations prior to settlement of the hedge 
however  as not all of duke energy s hedges relate to the exact location being hedged  a certain degree of hedge ineffectiveness may be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
the normal purchases and normal sales exception  as provided in sfas no 
as amended and interpreted by derivative implementation group issue c  scope exceptions normal purchases and normal sales exception for option type contracts and forward contracts in electricity  dig issue no 
c and amended by sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative 
table of contents part ii instruments and hedging activities  sfas no 
indicates that no recognition of the contract s fair value in the consolidated financial statements is required until settlement of the contract in duke energy s case  the delivery of power 
on a limited basis  duke energy applies the normal purchase and normal sales exception to certain contracts 
to the extent that the hedge is perfectly effective  income statement recognition for the contract will be the same under either model 
in addition to derivative contracts that are accounted for as cash flow hedges  fair value hedges  and normal purchases or sales  the accrual model also encompasses non derivative contracts used for commodity risk management purposes 
for these non derivative contracts  there is no recognition in the consolidated statements of operations until the service is provided or delivery occurs 
as a result of the september decision to pursue the sale or other disposition of substantially all of former dena s remaining assets and contracts outside the midwestern united states  duke energy discontinued hedge accounting for forward natural gas and power contracts accounted for as cash flow hedges and disqualified other forward power contracts previously designated under the normal purchases normal sales exception effective september for additional information regarding risk management activities  see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk include daily earnings at risk information related to commodity derivatives recorded using the mtm model and an operating income sensitivity analysis related to hypothetical changes in certain commodity prices recorded using the accrual model

duke energy made contributions to the westcoast dc plans of approximately million in  million in and million in as a result of the spin off of the natural gas businesses  duke energy has no future obligations to make contributions to the westcoast dc plans 
the calculation of pension expense  other post retirement expense and duke energy s pension and other post retirement liabilities require the use of assumptions 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expense and reported liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions 
duke energy believes that the most critical assumptions for pension and other post retirement benefits are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
additionally  medical and prescription drug cost trend rate assumptions are critical for other post retirement benefits 
the prescription drug trend rate assumption resulted from the effect of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act modernization act 
duke energy us plans duke energy and its subsidiaries including legacy cinergy businesses maintain non contributory defined benefit retirement plans us plans 
the us plans cover most us employees using a cash balance formula 
under a cash balance formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits that are based upon a percentage which may vary with age and years of service of current eligible earnings and current interest credits 
certain legacy cinergy us employees are covered under plans that use a final average earnings formula 
under a final average earnings formula  a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to a percentage of their highest year average earnings  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation maximum of years  plus a percentage of their highest year average earnings times years of participation in excess of years 
duke energy also maintains non qualified  non contributory defined benefit retirement plans which cover certain us executives 
duke energy and most of its subsidiaries also provide some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non contributory basis 
employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement  as defined in the plans

for both pension and other post retirement plans  duke energy assumed that its us plan s assets would generate a long term rate of return of as of september  the assets for duke energy s us pension and other post retirement plans are maintained by a master trust 
the investment objective of the master trust is to achieve reasonable returns on trust assets  subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk  for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants 
the asset allocation target was set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile with respect to the trust 
us equities are held for their high expected return 
non us equities  debt securities  and real estate are held for diversification 
investments within asset classes are to be diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments 
duke energy regularly reviews its actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances its investments to its targeted allocation when considered appropriate 
the expected long term rate of return of for the duke energy us assets was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers 
the weighted average returns expected by asset classes were for us equities  for non us equities  for fixed income securities  and for real estate

for legacy cinergy plans  the discount rate reflects remeasurement as of april  due to the merger between duke energy and cinergy 
duke energy determines the appropriate discount based on a aa bond yield curve 
the yield is selected based on bonds with cash flows that match the timing and amount of the expected benefit payments under the plan

westcoast plans westcoast and its subsidiaries maintain contributory and non contributory defined benefit db and defined contribution dc retirement plans covering substantially all employees 
the db plans provide retirement benefits based on each plan participant s years of service and final average earnings 
under the dc plans  company contributions are determined according to the terms of the plan and based on each plan participant s age  years of service and current eligible earnings 
westcoast also provides health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a non contributory basis 
employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement  as defined in the plans 
effective december   a new plan was implemented for all non bargaining employees and the majority of bargaining employees

total us franchised electric and gas projected capital and investment expenditures include approximately billion for maintenance and upgrades of existing plants and infrastructure to serve load growth  approximately billion of environmental expenditures  and approximately billion of expansion capital 
duke energy s us franchised electric and gas business segment is evaluating the construction of several large  new electric generating plants in north carolina  south carolina  and indiana 
during this evaluation process  duke energy has begun to see significant increases in the estimated costs of these projects driven by strong domestic and international demand for the material  equipment  and labor necessary to construct these facilities 
in october  duke energy made a filing with the ncuc related to the duke energy carolinas request for a cpcn for the cliffside project

duke energy operated a commercial marketing and trading business that was acquired as part of the merger with cinergy in april in june  duke energy announced it had reached an agreement to sell cinergy s commercial marketing and trading business  as well as associated contracts 
the sale closed in october and  upon closing  the buyer assumed the credit  collateral  market and legal risk associated with the trading positions acquired 
a reduction in the credit rating of duke energy to below investment grade as of december  would have resulted in duke energy posting additional collateral of up to approximately million  including impacts of cinergy and excluding any collateral requirements associated with the spin off of the natural gas businesses in january the majority of this collateral is related to outstanding surety bonds 
duke energy would fund any additional collateral requirements through a combination of cash on hand and the use of credit facilities 
additionally  if credit ratings for duke energy or its affiliates fall below investment grade there is likely to be a negative impact on its working capital and terms of trade that is not possible to fully quantify  in addition to the posting of additional collateral and segregation of cash described above

as such  these guarantee arrangements involve elements of performance and credit risk  which are not included on the consolidated balance sheets 
the possibility of duke energy  spectra energy capital or cinergy having to honor its contingencies is largely dependent upon the future operations of the subsidiaries  investees and other third parties  or the occurrence of certain future events 
issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of duke energy s operations 
thus  if duke energy discontinued issuing these guarantee arrangements  there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in contemplation of the spin off of the natural gas businesses on january   certain guarantees that were previously issued by spectra energy capital were transferred to duke energy prior to the consummation of the spin off 
this resulted in duke energy recording an immaterial liability for certain guarantees that were previously grandfathered under the provisions of fin and  therefore  were not recognized in the consolidated balance sheets 
guarantees issued by spectra energy capital or natural gas transmission on or prior to december  remained with spectra energy capital subsequent to the spin off  except for certain guarantees that are in the process of being assigned to duke energy 
during this assignment period  duke energy has indemnified spectra energy capital against any losses incurred under these guarantee obligations

table of contents part ii commodity price risk duke energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy related assets 
price risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities 
duke energy employs established policies and procedures to manage its risks associated with these market fluctuations using various commodity derivatives  including swaps  futures  forwards and options 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies and note to the consolidated financial statements  risk management and hedging activities  credit risk  and financial instruments 
validation of a contract s fair value is performed by an internal group independent of duke energy s deal origination areas 
while duke energy uses common industry practices to develop its valuation techniques  changes in duke energy s pricing methodologies or the underlying assumptions could result in significantly different fair values and income recognition 
hedging strategies 
duke energy closely monitors the risks associated with these commodity price changes on its future operations and  where appropriate  uses various commodity instruments such as electricity  coal and natural gas forward contracts to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations 
duke energy s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge the output and production of assets 
to the extent that instruments accounted for as hedges are effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact to the consolidated statements of operations until delivery or settlement occurs 
accordingly  assumptions and valuation techniques for these contracts have no impact on reported earnings prior to settlement 
several factors influence the effectiveness of a hedge contract  including the use of contracts with different commodities or unmatched terms and counterparty credit risk 
hedge effectiveness is monitored regularly and measured each month

on a limited basis  us franchised electric and gas and commercial power apply the normal purchase and normal sales exception to certain contracts 
recognition for the contracts in the consolidated statements of operations will be the same regardless of whether the contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges or as normal purchases and sales  unless designated as the hedged item in a fair value hedge  assuming no hedge ineffectiveness 
income recognition and realization related to normal purchases and normal sales contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of power 
however  duke energy s decisions in to sell former dena southeast plants  reduce former dena s interest in partially completed plants and sale or disposition of substantially all of former dena s remaining physical and commercial assets outside of the midwestern united states and certain contractual positions related to the midwestern assets see normal purchases and normal sales below required the reassessment of all associated derivatives  including normal purchases and normal sales 
this required a change from the application of the accrual model to the mtm model for these contracts and resulted in recording substantial unrealized losses that had not previously been recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
generation portfolio risks 
duke energy is primarily exposed to market price fluctuations of wholesale power and natural gas prices in the us franchised electric and gas and commercial power segments 
duke energy optimizes the value of its bulk power marketing and non regulated generation portfolios 
the portfolios include generation assets power and capacity  fuel  and emission allowances 
modeled forecasts of future generation output  fuel requirements  and emission allowance requirements are based on forward power  fuel and emission allowance markets 
the component pieces of the portfolio are bought and sold based on this model in order to manage the economic value of the portfolio  where such market transparency exists 
the generation portfolio not utilized to serve native load or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december  and  it was estimated that a ten percent price change per mega watt hour in wholesale power prices would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in and million in  respectively 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   it was estimated that a ten percent price change per mmbtu in natural gas prices would have a corresponding effect on duke energy s pre tax income of approximately million in 
table of contents part ii normal purchases and normal sales 
during the third quarter of  duke energy s board of directors authorized and directed management to execute the sale or disposition of substantially all of former dena s remaining assets and contracts outside the midwestern united states  approximately  megawatts of power generation  and certain contractual positions related to the midwestern assets see note to the consolidated financial statements  discontinued operations and assets held for sale 
as a result of this decision  duke energy recognized a pre tax loss of approximately billion in the third quarter of for the disqualification of its power and gas forward sales contracts previously designated under the normal purchases normal sales exception 
this loss is partially offset by the recognition of a pre tax gain of approximately billion for the discontinuance of hedge accounting for natural gas and power cash flow hedges 
duke energy has retained the midwestern generation assets in the commercial power segment  representing approximately  megawatts of power generation see note to the consolidated financial statements  acquisitions and dispositions for further details on the completed cinergy merger 
trading and undesignated contracts 
the risk in the trading portfolio is measured and monitored on a daily basis utilizing a value at risk var model to determine the potential one day favorable or unfavorable var calculation 
duke energy s var amounts for commodity derivatives recorded using the mtm model are not material as a result of management decisions to dispose of certain businesses with higher risk profiles  including the former dena operations outside the midwestern united states and the cinergy commercial marketing and trading businesses 
in connection with the effort to reduce the risk profile  during duke energy finalized the sale of the former dena power generation fleet outside of the midwest to ls power and sold the cinergy commercial marketing and trading business to fortis 
subsequent to the sales of both trading businesses  duke energy no longer uses var as a trading portfolio measure 
other commodity risks 
duke energy  through commercial power  owns coal based synthetic fuel production facilities which convert coal feedstock into synthetic fuel for sale to third parties 
the synthetic fuel produced at these facilities qualifies for tax credits through in accordance with internal revenue code section k if certain requirements are satisfied 
the internal revenue code provides for a phase out of synthetic fuel tax credits if the average annual wellhead oil prices increase above certain levels 
if commercial power were to operate its synthetic fuel facilities based on december  prices throughout the entire forthcoming year  yet crude oil prices were to rise such that the tax credit is completely phased out  projected net income in would be negatively impacted by approximately million 
duke energy is unlikely to experience a loss of this magnitude because the exposure to synthetic fuel tax credit phase out is monitored and duke energy may choose to reduce or cease synthetic fuel production depending on the expectation of any potential tax credit phase out 
duke energy may also reduce its exposure to crude prices through the execution of derivative transactions 
the objective of these activities is to reduce potential losses incurred if the reference price in a year exceeds a level triggering a phase out of synthetic fuel tax credits 
pre tax income for or was also not expected to be materially impacted as of december  or for exposures to other commodities price changes 
these hypothetical calculations consider existing hedge positions and estimated production levels  but do not consider other potential effects that might result from such changes in commodity prices 
duke energy s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors  including contract size  length  market liquidity  location and unique or specific contract terms 
credit risk credit risk represents the loss that duke energy would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations 
to reduce credit exposure  duke energy seeks to enter into netting agreements with counterparties that permit duke energy to offset receivables and payables with such counterparties 
duke energy attempts to further reduce credit risk with certain counterparties by entering into agreements that enable duke energy to obtain collateral or to terminate or reset the terms of transactions after specified time periods or upon the occurrence of credit related events 
duke energy may  at times  use credit derivatives or other structures and techniques to provide for third party credit enhancement of duke energy s counterparties obligations 
duke energy s principal customers for power and natural gas marketing and transportation services are industrial end users  marketers  local distribution companies and utilities located throughout the us  canada and latin america 
duke energy has concentrations of receivables from natural gas and electric utilities and their affiliates  as well as industrial customers and marketers throughout these regions 
these concentrations of customers may affect duke energy s overall credit risk in that risk factors can negatively impact the credit quality of the entire sector 
where exposed to credit risk  duke energy analyzes the counterparties financial condition prior to entering into an agreement  establishes credit limits and monitors the appropriateness of those limits on an ongoing basis 

table of contents part ii the following table represents duke energy s distribution of unsecured credit exposures at december   including spectra energy businesses 
these credit exposures are aggregated by ultimate parent company  include on and off balance sheet exposures  are presented net of collateral  and take into account contractual netting rights 
distribution of enterprise credit exposures as of december  of total investment grade externally rated non investment grade externally rated investment grade internally rated non investment grade internally rated total externally rated represents enterprise relationships that have published ratings from at least one major credit rating agency 
internally rated represents those relationships which have no rating by a major credit rating agency 
for those relationships  duke energy utilizes appropriate risk rating methodologies and credit scoring models to develop an internal risk rating which is intended to map to an external rating equivalent 
the total of the unsecured credit exposure included in the table above represents approximately of the gross fair value of duke energy s receivables and unrealized gains on mark to market and hedging transactions on the consolidated balance sheets at december  duke energy had no net exposure to any one customer that represented greater than of the gross fair value of trade accounts receivable and unrealized gains on mark to market and hedging transactions at december  excluding the businesses transferred to spectra energy in january  the split between investment grade and non investment grade would have been approximately and  respectively 
based on duke energy s policies for managing credit risk  its exposures and its credit and other reserves  duke energy does not anticipate a materially adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of non performance by any counterparty 
during  duke energy finalized the sale of the former dena portfolio of derivative contracts to barclays and sold the cinergy commercial marketing and trading business to fortis  which eliminated duke energy s credit  collateral  market and legal risk associated with these related trading positions 
in  the industrial development corp of the city of edinburg  texas idc issued approximately million in bonds to purchase equipment for lease to duke hidalgo hidalgo  a subsidiary of spectra energy capital 
spectra energy capital unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed the lease payments of hidalgo to idc through in  hidalgo was sold to calpine corporation and spectra energy capital remained obligated under the lease guaranty 
in january  hidalgo and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection in connection with the previous bankruptcy filing by its parent  calpine corporation in december gross  undiscounted exposure under the guarantee obligation as of december  is approximately million  including principal and interest payments 
duke energy does not believe a loss under the guarantee obligation is probable as of december   but continues to evaluate the situation 
therefore  no reserves have been recorded for any contingent loss as of december  no demands for payment have been made under the guarantee 
if losses are incurred under the guarantee  spectra energy capital has certain rights which should allow it to mitigate such loss 
subsequent to the spin off the natural gas businesses  this guarantee remained with spectra energy capital 
however  duke energy indemnified spectra energy capital against any future losses that could arise from payments required under this guarantee 
duke energy s industry has historically operated under negotiated credit lines for physical delivery contracts 
duke energy frequently uses master collateral agreements to mitigate certain credit exposures 
the collateral agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold 
the threshold amount represents an unsecured credit limit  determined in accordance with the corporate credit policy 
collateral agreements also provide that the inability to post collateral is sufficient cause to terminate contracts and liquidate all positions 
duke energy also obtains cash or letters of credit from customers to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements  where appropriate  based on its financial analysis of the customer and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction 

table of contents part ii collateral amounts held or posted may be fixed or may vary depending on the terms of the collateral agreement and the nature of the underlying exposure and cover normal purchases and normal sales  hedging contracts  and optimization contracts outstanding 
duke energy may be required to return certain held collateral and post additional collateral should price movements adversely impact the value of open contracts or positions 
in many cases  duke energy s and its counterparties publicly disclosed credit ratings impact the amounts of additional collateral to be posted 
if duke energy or its affiliates have a credit rating downgrade  it could result in reductions in duke energy s unsecured thresholds granted by counterparties 
likewise  downgrades in credit ratings of counterparties could require counterparties to post additional collateral to duke energy and its affiliates 
see liquidity and capital resources financing cash flows and liquidity for additional discussion of downgrades 
interest rate risk duke energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance of variable and fixed rate debt and commercial paper 
duke energy manages its interest rate exposure by limiting its variable rate exposures to percentages of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
duke energy also enters into financial derivative instruments  including  but not limited to  interest rate swaps  swaptions and us treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure 
see notes   and to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  risk management and hedging activities  credit risk  and financial instruments  and debt and credit facilities 
based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   it was estimated that if market interest rates average higher lower in than in  interest expense  net of offsetting impacts in interest income  would increase decrease by approximately million  excluding interest rate risk related to businesses transferred to spectra energy in january comparatively  based on a sensitivity analysis as of december   had interest rates averaged higher lower in than in  it was estimated that interest expense  net of offsetting impacts in interest income  would have increased decreased by approximately million 
these amounts were estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable rate securities outstanding  adjusted for interest rate hedges  short term investments  cash and cash equivalents outstanding as of december  and the decrease in interest rate sensitivity was primarily due to the exclusion of interest rate risk  principally subsidiary debt and swaps  related to businesses transferred to spectra energy 
if interest rates changed significantly  management would likely take actions to manage its exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in duke energy s financial structure 
equity price risk duke energy maintains trust funds  as required by the nrc and the ncuc  to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations 
as of december  and  these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities  fixed rate  fixed income securities and cash and cash equivalents 
per nrc and ncuc requirements  these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning 
those investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates 
accounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through us franchised electric and gas rates  and fluctuations in equity prices or interest rates do not affect duke energy s consolidated results of operations 
earnings or losses of the fund will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered from us franchised electric and gas rates 
bison  duke energy s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary  maintains investments to fund various business risks and losses  such as workers compensation  property  business interruption and general liability 
those investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates 
duke energy s costs of providing non contributory defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors  such as the rates of return on plan assets  discount rate  the rate of increase in health care costs and contributions made to the plans 
foreign currency risk duke energy is exposed to foreign currency risk from investments in international affiliate businesses owned and operated in foreign countries and from certain commodity related transactions within domestic operations 
to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations  contracts may be denominated in or indexed to the us dollar and or local inflation rates  or investments may be naturally hedged through debt denominated or issued in the foreign currency 
duke energy may also use foreign currency derivatives  where possible  to manage its risk related to foreign currency fluctuations 
to monitor its currency exchange rate risks  duke energy uses sensitivity analysis  which measures the impact of devaluation of the foreign currencies to which it has exposure 

table of contents part ii in  duke energy s primary foreign currency rate exposures are expected to be the brazilian real and the peruvian new sol 
a devaluation in the currency exchange rates as of december  in all of duke energy s exposure currencies would result in an estimated net pre tax loss on the translation of local currency earnings of approximately million to duke energy s consolidated statements of operations in the consolidated balance sheet would be negatively impacted by approximately million currency translation through the cumulative translation adjustment in aoci as of december  as a result of a devaluation in the currency exchange rates 
other issues spin off of the natural gas businesses 
in june  the board of directors of duke energy authorized management to pursue a plan to create two separate publicly traded companies by spinning off duke energy s natural gas businesses to duke energy shareholders 
the spin off was effective january  the new natural gas company  which is named spectra energy  principally consists of duke energy s natural gas transmission business segment  which includes union gas  and also includes duke energy s ownership interest in defs 
approximately billion of assets  billion of liabilities which includes approximately billion of debt issued by spectra energy capital and its consolidated subsidiaries and billion of common stockholders equity were distributed from duke energy as of the date of the spin off 
assets and liabilities of entities included in the spin off of spectra energy were transferred from duke energy on a historical cost basis on the date of the spin off transaction 
as a result of the spin off transaction  on january   in lieu of adjusting the conversion ratio of the convertible debt  duke energy issued approximately million shares of spectra energy common stock to holders of duke energy s convertible senior notes due  consistent with the terms of the debt agreements 
the issuance of spectra energy shares to the convertible debt holders is expected to result in a pretax charge in the range of million to million in duke energy s consolidated statement of operations 
the historical results of the natural gas businesses are expected to be treated as discontinued operations at duke energy in future periods beginning with the first quarter of the primary businesses remaining in duke energy post spin are the us franchised electric and gas business segment  the commercial power business segment  the international energy business segment and duke energy s effective interest in the crescent jv 
the decision to spin off the natural gas business is expected to deliver long term value to shareholders 
energy policy act of the energy policy act of was signed into law in august the legislation directs specified agencies to conduct a significant number of studies on various aspects of the energy industry and to implement other provisions through rulemakings 
among the key provisions  the energy policy act of repeals the puhca of  directs ferc to establish a self regulating electric reliability organization governed by an independent board with ferc oversight  extends the price anderson act for years until  provides loan guarantees  standby support and production tax credits for new nuclear reactors  gives ferc enhanced merger approval authority  provides ferc new backstop authority for the siting of certain electric transmission projects  streamlines the processes for approval and permitting of interstate pipelines  and reforms hydropower relicensing 
ferc s enhanced merger authority will not apply to transactions pending with the ferc as of august   such as the duke energy and cinergy merger  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  acquisitions and dispositions 
in late and early  ferc initiated several rulemakings as directed by the energy policy act of duke energy is currently evaluating these proposals and does not anticipate that these rulemakings will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
global climate change 
the greenhouse gas policy of the united states currently favors voluntary actions to reduce emissions and continued research and technology development over near term mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction requirements 
although several bills have been introduced in congress that would mandate greenhouse gas emission reductions  none have advanced through the legislature and presently there are no federal mandatory greenhouse gas reduction requirements 
while it is possible that congress will adopt some form of mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction legislation in the future  the timing and specific requirements of any such legislation are highly uncertain 
several northeastern states and california are in the process of developing their own mandatory greenhouse gas emission reduction programs  none of which will impact duke energy s operations 
duke energy supports the enactment of us federal legislation that would require a gradual transition to a lower carbon intensive economy 
legislation preferably would be in the form of a federal level carbon tax or cap and trade based program 
duke energy  believing that it is in the best interest of its investors and customers to do so  is actively participating in the evolution of federal policy on this important issue 
duke energy s proactive role in climate change policy debates in the united states does not change the uncertainty around such policy 
due to the speculative outlook regarding us federal policy  duke energy cannot estimate the potential effect of future us greenhouse gas policy on its future consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
duke energy will assess and respond to the potential implications of us greenhouse gas policy for its business operations if policy becomes sufficiently developed and certain to support a meaningful assessment

fin 
in july  the fasb issued fin  which provides guidance on accounting for income tax positions about which duke energy has concluded there is a level of uncertainty with respect to the recognition in duke energy s financial statements 
fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet 
tax positions are defined very broadly and include not only tax deductions and credits but also decisions not to file in a particular jurisdiction  as well as the taxability of transactions 
duke energy will implement fin effective january  the implementation is expected to result in a cumulative effect adjustment to beginning retained earnings on the consolidated statement of common stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss in the first quarter in the range of million to million 
corresponding entries will impact a variety of balance sheet line items  including deferred income taxes  taxes accrued  other liabilities  and goodwill 
upon implementation of fin  duke energy will reflect interest expense related to taxes as interest expense  in the consolidated statement of operations 
in addition  subsequent accounting for fin after january  will involve an evaluation to determine if any changes have occurred that would impact the existing uncertain tax positions as well as
