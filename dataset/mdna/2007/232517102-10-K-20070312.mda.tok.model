item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the three years ended december  general overview our products are sold primarily into the electronics assembly  semiconductor dram memory  and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets  where we sell products both to original equipment manufacturers of production equipment and to end user customers that produce circuit boards and semiconductor wafers and devices 
historically these markets have been very cyclical  with periods of rapid growth as worldwide capacity is added to support increased consumer demand for electronic products  and new capital equipment is purchased as a result of technology changes in electronics components  such as miniaturization  and changing production requirements 
these periods of growth have historically been followed by periods of excess capacity and reduced capital spending 
the worldwide demand for cell phones  laptops and other consumer electronics remained strong and continued to increase throughout  driving the need for increased production of printed circuit boards and memory modules 
in addition  the economies in the countries where most of our products are sold also remained strong 
these factors combined to drive an increase in demand for our electronic assembly and semiconductor products in compared to demand for our products started to increase in the third quarter of  continued to improve throughout the first quarter of  and then leveled off at lower  but still favorable levels  for the remainder of our consolidated revenues for increased from to million 
income from operations for  benefiting from the higher level of revenue and lower cost structure implemented during  and  improved to million from million in our operating results declined in in response to downturns in both the electronic assembly and semiconductor capital equipment markets that begin late in the third quarter of and continued through the second quarter of although the economies in the countries where most of our products are sold continued to be strong  the semiconductor market weakened  and with it  the circuit board production market 
while this downturn was not as severe as the downturn experienced from to early  it resulted in a significant decline in operating results over our exceptionally strong results in consolidated revenues for declined from to million 
operating results for benefited from a lower cost structure implemented during  and as a result  operating profits were million despite lower revenues compared to order rates during the fourth quarter of were consistent with order levels for the second and third quarters of we believe the global markets for our electronic assembly and semiconductor products remain relatively strong 
although we cannot predict with precision the trends in the markets we serve  we do not anticipate any significant softening in our markets  at least for the early months of during  as a result of our lower cost structure and history of improved profitability  we reduced the valuation allowance for deferred income taxes that had been established in the third quarter of the reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in a non cash income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of of million 
see note of this form k for a further discussion of the accounting treatment for income taxes 
our balance sheet is also well positioned as the result of improved operating results and effective management of working capital and other assets 
we have no debt and our cash and marketable securities are million at december  compared to million at december  segment results during the fourth quarter of  we reorganized our business into two operating segments  the electronic assembly and semiconductor segments  in order to increase focus and management attention on growth opportunities in our markets 
the electronic assembly segment designs  manufactures and sells optical process control sensors and inspection systems for the electronic assembly equipment market 

table of contents the semiconductor segment designs  manufactures and sells optical and other process control sensors and related equipment for the semiconductor capital equipment market 
segment information follows year ended december  in thousands revenue electronic assembly semiconductor total gross margin electronic assembly semiconductor total operating expense electronic assembly semiconductor total income loss from operations electronic assembly semiconductor total income from operations interest income and other income before income taxes revenues our revenues increased by to million in from million in  and decreased in from million in the following table sets forth  for the years indicated  revenues by product line in thousands electronic assembly oem sensors smt systems total electronic assembly semiconductor total electronic assembly revenues from our electronic assembly sensors increased million or during compared to and decreased million or during compared to during  revenue from electronic assembly sensors were positively impacted by improved worldwide demand for cell phones  laptops and other consumer electronics  driving the need for increased production of printed circuit boards and memory modules 
in addition  the economies in the countries where most of our products are sold also were strong 
these factors combined to drive an increase in demand for our electronic assembly sensors in compared to during  revenue from electronic assembly sensors were negatively impacted by a downturn in our smt electronic assembly market  which began in the fourth quarter of  and continued through the second quarter of sensor revenues were sequentially higher in the third and fourth quarters of  but had not yet returned to the peak levels of in addition  sensor revenue was favorably impacted by the introduction of a new inprinter inspection camera for dek international gmbh 

table of contents during  sensor revenues were positively impacted by improved market conditions in the worldwide market for smt capital equipment and by the introduction of two new sensors for one of our large customers 
these sensors were designed for the latest generation pick and place machine of this customer  which was introduced during and resulted in a higher content of our products per machine than in the previous version 
revenues from our smt systems products increased million or during compared to and decreased million or during compared to like our sensor revenue  revenue from our smt system products were positively impacted by improved worldwide demand for electronics and favorable conditions in the countries where most of our products are sold 
revenue from our systems products in was also favorably impacted by the introduction of a new version of our flex series aoi system  the flex ultra  in the first quarter of this system  which offers improved performance over earlier versions of our flex aoi system  was favorably received by the market 
our sales of flex products increased million or during during  revenue from our smt system products were also negatively impacted by a downturn in the smt electronic assembly market  but this negative impact was partially offset by positive market acceptance of our next generation solder paste inspection system  the se ultra  and increased sales of our flex series aoi systems 
sales of our flex aoi systems increased approximately 
million compared to during  revenues from smt systems  primarily our se solder paste inspection system  were positively impacted by improved market conditions in the smt capital equipment markets and by success in selling systems to many of the large manufacturers of circuit boards in asia particularly china 
a large portion of the worldwide production capacity for printed circuit boards is being added in asia  and we have been successful in selling inspection systems to new and existing customers in that region through our expanded distribution capability opened singapore sales office in and a sales office in china in 
in addition  revenues from our flex series aoi systems increased million compared to levels 
we believe that increased use of outsourcing for circuit board assembly  production difficulties associated with smaller component sizes  increased production speeds and increased cost pressure on companies manufacturing circuit boards has caused increased demand for our inspection equipment 
export revenue from electronic assembly sensors and smt systems totaled million in  million in and million in  comprising of electronic assembly revenue in  and of electronic assembly revenue in both and an increasing proportion of our sales have been to international customers as manufacturing of electronic components has migrated offshore  particularly to china and other areas of asia 
we believe the market trend toward automated inspection using smt inspection systems is continuing to grow and emerge due to ongoing miniaturization of smt circuit board components 
required for downsizing products  some new generation components have become so small that it is now virtually impossible for the human eye to inspect circuit boards for defects in solder paste quality  component placement and solder joints 
for this reason  we believe automated inspection has become the only viable means for inspecting smt circuit boards with such tiny components  and we believe that our smt systems products will be one of our primary growth drivers over the next few years 
semiconductor revenues from semiconductor products increased by million or in compared to  following a decrease of million or in compared to the increase in was due to improved conditions in the semiconductor fabrication capital equipment market that began late in the fourth quarter of  resulting in higher revenues from our wafer mapping sensors and new wafersense products 
revenues from our frame grabber products increased slightly in compared to the decrease in revenue in was due to lower revenues from wafer mapping sensors and frame grabber products  resulting from depressed market conditions in the semiconductor fabrication and general industrial capital equipment markets 
our wafer mapping and frame grabber products are relatively mature 
we anticipate that future growth in our semiconductor revenues  exclusive of changes related to capital procurement cycles  will come from our new wafersense products 
wafersense is a family of wireless  wafer like precision measurement tools for in situ setup  calibration and process optimization in semiconductor processing equipment 
we are currently working on several new additions to the wafersense product line  including additional leveling sensors and new gapping and teaching sensors 

table of contents export revenue from semiconductor products totaled million or of total semiconductor revenue in  million or of total semiconductor revenue in  and million or of total semiconductor revenue  in the increase in international revenue as a percentage of total semiconductor revenue in compared to is due to increased sales of frame grabbers in europe 
in addition  our wafer mapping sensors do not generate significant international sales 
fluctuations in the sales level of these products can also cause fluctuations in our international revenue  as a percentage of total semiconductor revenue 
the increase in international revenue as a percentage of total semiconductor revenue for  compared to  is due to lower sales of wafer mapping sensors 
adoption of sfas no 
r during the first quarter of  we began recording compensation expense for equity based awards as required by sfas no 
r 
the following table sets forth compensation expense pre tax by segment for our equity based awards for the year ended december  in thousands twelve months ended december  in thousands electronic assembly semi conductor total cost of revenue research and development expenses selling  general and administrative expenses total gross margin our gross margin as a percentage of sales for both our electronic assembly and semiconductor products are somewhat dependent on the level of revenues and resulting production levels over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs that do not vary with activity levels 
in addition  with higher production volumes manufacturing processes become more efficient and we are able to negotiate lower material costs from our suppliers as the result of volume discounts which reduces the overall cost of producing products for sale 
the mix of products sold can also have an impact on electronic assembly and semiconductor margins 
electronic assembly gross margin as a percentage of electronic assembly sales were in  in and in the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in  compared to  was due to increasing competition resulting in lower sales prices for our electronic assembly products  particularly our smt system products 
increased competition and resulting price pressure on our smt system products reduced gross margins as a percentage of electronic assembly sales in  compared to  by approximately one percentage point 
the remaining decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in was due to a million inventory write down of a non oem sensor product  increasing price competition for our other electronic assembly sensor products  and changes in mix of products sold 
our gross margin as a percentage of sales is generally lower for our system products as compared to our sensor products 
the decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in  compared to  was due in part  to pricing pressures from increased competition for sales of our solder paste inspection machines  reducing electronic assembly gross margins as a percentage of sales by approximately two percentage points 
the remaining decrease in gross margin as a percentage of sales in was due to product mix  with a higher percentage of our sensor and system sales coming from lower margin products  and the lower level of production volumes  which reduced manufacturing efficiency when compared to as the market for automated inspection has continued to grow and emerge  additional competitors have entered the marketplace for these products 
although we believe our smt system products compete favorably against these competitive products on the basis of performance and reliability  the introduction of lower price competitive models has required us to decrease the selling price of our products in some markets 
with respect to our systems products  and particularly our solder paste inspection machines  we anticipate that pricing pressures will continue in due to the additional competition in the marketplace for all forms of automated circuit board inspection 

table of contents semiconductor gross margin as a percentage of sales were in  in and in similar to the electronic assembly segment  gross margin as a percentage of sales for the semiconductor segment is dependent on revenue mix and the level of production volume over which to spread fixed manufacturing overhead costs 
gross margins decreased as a percentage of revenue in from due to a change in revenue mix  with our highest margin wafer mapping sensors representing a smaller percentage of total semiconductor revenue 
in addition  revenue from our lower margin leveling sensor products was up significantly in compared to gross margins decreased as a percentage of revenue in from due to decreased volume  and a change in revenue mix  with lower sales of higher margin wafer mapping sensors 
we currently expect gross margins as a percentage of revenue from our semiconductor products to remain consistent or increase slightly in from levels  due to anticipated changes in revenue  and new product introductions  which are expected to carry slightly higher gross margins than our existing products 
operating expenses we believe continued investment in research and development of new products  coupled with continued investment and development of our sales channels  is critical to future growth and profitability 
we maintain research and development and sales and marketing expenses at relatively high levels  even during periods of downturn in our electronic assembly and semiconductor capital equipment markets  as we continue to fund development of important new products  and continue to invest in our sales channels and develop new sales territories 
we are currently expecting research and development  and selling  general and administrative expenses to be higher in  compared to  as we continue new product development efforts  and continue development of our sales channels and new sales territories 
we are considering additional research and development projects  and may elect to increase expenditures based on an assessment of the future revenue and profit potential of these projects 
further  sales commissions and other selling  general and administrative costs may be higher in if revenue and profit levels increase over levels 
fluctuations in the level of research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for both the electronic assembly and semiconductor segments are primarily due to fluctuations in the level of revenue in  and electronic assembly research and development expenses were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in research and development expense in compared to was due to increased compensation costs of million  including increases in company wide incentive compensation costs in  resulting from higher levels of revenue and profit  and stock compensation costs resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the remaining increase in research and development expense in was due to higher costs for other expenses related to our development projects  such as travel  occupancy and supplies 
during we completed development of our th generation laseralign sensor for juki s industry leading line of pick and place machines 
the new sensor provides juki with a throughput improvement  alignment capability for the smallest components  improved reliability and the lowest cost of ownership 
early in we introduced an enhanced version of our flex series automated optical inspection system  the flex ultra 
we continued to make improvements to our se ultra and flex ultra smt products throughout  including improvements for speed  measurement performance  reliability  ease of use  and simplified operator interfaces with foreign language capability 
we also continued work on our epv technological initiative 
the decrease in research and development expenses in compared to  was principally due to a million decrease in company wide incentive compensation costs in  resulting from lower levels of revenue and profits 
during we completed development of our new se ultra solder paste inspection system  and our new inprinter inspection camera for dek international gmbh 
we also started development of an enhanced version of our flex series automated optical inspection system 
during  research and development efforts were primarily focused on initial development activities for several new sensor products  including development activities for the new embedded process verification sensor family epv  continued development of the se and flex series inspection systems  next generation laseralign products  and board alignment cameras 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to was due to increased compensation costs of million  including increases for company wide incentive compensation costs in  resulting from higher levels of revenue and profit  stock compensation expense resulting from adoption of sfas no 
r  plus additional field sales and applications support personnel required to generate the higher level of smt systems sales in travel costs were higher in due to the additional field sales and support headcount added in and the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in compared to  was principally due to a million reduction in sales commissions and company wide incentive compensation costs associated with lower levels of revenue and profits in  partially offset by increased costs for our new sales office in china that opened in december semiconductor research and development expenses were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in research and development expense in compared to is due to increased compensation costs for company wide incentive compensation programs and stock compensation expense resulting from adoption of sfas no 
r 
a million decrease in incentive compensation costs  resulting from lower levels of revenue and profit in  contributed to the decrease in research and development expense in compared to during and  we continued to develop various new sensors for our wafersense family of precision measurement tools  including new automated leveling  gapping and teachings sensors to assist with process optimization and yield improvement in the semiconductor fabrication process 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million or of revenue in  million or of revenue in and million or of revenue in the increase in selling  general and administrative expense in compared to is due to costs for additional management  higher sales commissions  equity compensation costs resulting from adoption of sfas no 
r and company wide incentive compensation costs resulting from higher levels of revenue and profit 
expenses in were flat compared to  as a million reduction in costs for sales commissions and company wide incentive compensation programs  resulting from lower revenue and profit levels in  were offset by higher costs for additional management and marketing employees 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our electronic assembly segment was million in  and we expect amortization expense for acquired intangible assets related to our electronic assembly segment to be million in amortization of acquired intangible assets related to our semiconductor segment was million in  million in and million in the decrease in semiconductor related amortization was due to certain acquired intangible assets becoming fully amortized during and we expect amortization expense for acquired intangible assets related to our semiconductor segment will be less than million in interest income and other interest income and other primarily includes interest earned on investments and gains and losses associated with foreign currency transactions 
interest income and other increased during and as the result of additional invested funds  higher rates of interest earned on those funds and lower foreign currency transaction losses 
interest income and other increased during as the result of additional invested funds  partially offset by increased foreign currency transaction losses 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of foreign net operating loss carry forwards  us tax credit carry forwards and temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carry forwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards no 

table of contents in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our decision to record the valuation allowance was based on the cumulative losses we had incurred over the three years prior to that date  the fact that we were continuing to generate operating losses and that we fully utilized our loss carry back benefit in from the third quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of  we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
during  we recorded an income tax provision of approximately million resulting in an effective income tax rate of approximately because we had utilized our available tax operating losses and were subject to alternative minimum tax limitations 
because we continued to maintain a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  projected current taxes payable comprised the entire tax provision  and were the basis for our effective tax rate 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets  initially established in the third quarter of  resulting in a non cash income tax benefit of million 
our tax benefit for  including reversal of the valuation allowance  was equal to million 
we considered a number of factors in our decision to reduce the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  including our anticipated level of profitability in the future  our history of recent profitability and cumulative profitability since inception  and utilization of our available us based net operating loss carry forwards 
after considering these factors  we concluded that a reduction in the valuation allowance was appropriate 
accordingly  the benefit we will derive in future accounting periods from carry forwards and deductible temporary differences has been reflected as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 
due to the prior year reduction of the valuation allowance  we were taxed at a more normalized rate in our tax provision for includes a million income tax benefit from favorable resolution of a tax contingency accrual for prior year s income taxes  resulting from the closing of a domestic statute of limitations 
we also recognized a million income tax benefit that resulted from the federal r d tax credit signed into law in the fourth quarter of and made retroactive for the full year 
for  including the income tax benefits described above  we recorded a tax provision at a consolidated worldwide effective tax rate of 
liquidity and capital resources our cash and cash equivalents increased by million during primarily because of maturities of million of marketable securities  net of purchases  million of cash generated from operating activities  partially offset by the purchase of million of capital assets and million of cash used by financing activities 
our cash and cash equivalents fluctuate in part because of maturities of marketable securities  and investment of cash balances in marketable securities  or from other sources of cash  in addition to marketable securities 
accordingly  we believe the combined balances of cash and marketable securities provide a more reliable indication of our available liquidity 
our combined balances of cash and marketable securities increased million to million as of december  from million as of december  we generated million of cash from operations during cash generated from operations included net income of million  which included million of net non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence  doubtful accounts and deferred taxes  foreign currency transactions and stock compensation expense 
changes in operating assets and liabilities included increases in accounts payable of million and increases in accrued expenses of million 
this cash generated was offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 
million  increases in inventory of million and decreases in advance customer payments of million 
increases in accounts payable are the result of inventory purchases to support additional customer evaluations of our smt system products 
the increase in accrued expenses resulted from the accrual of company wide incentive compensation costs due to higher levels of revenue and profit in and increases in warranty reserves resulting from higher revenue levels 
increases in accounts receivable are due to higher revenue levels in  compared to the decrease in advance customer payments is due to lower sales from customers who pay prior to our recognition of revenue from the related sale 
we generated million of cash from operations during cash generated from operations primarily included net income of million  which included net non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization  provisions for inventory obsolescence and doubtful accounts of million  tax benefits from the exercise of stock options of million and increases in accounts payable of million 
this cash generated was adjusted by million related to the non cash deferred tax provision and offset by an increase in accounts receivable of million  increases in inventory of million and increases in other assets of million  as well as reductions in accrued expenses of million 
increases in accounts payable are the result of increased inventory purchases 
the increase in deferred taxes resulted from the reversal of the valuation allowance established in increases in accounts receivable are due to higher revenue levels in the fourth quarter of  compared to  and proportionately more system sales through distributors  which increases the timing of receivable collections 
increases in inventory are the result of purchases to support higher order rates and backlog at the end of  compared to decreases in accrued expenses are primarily due to payment of incentive compensation accruals in 
table of contents we used million of cash for investing activities during compared to million in changes in the level of investments in marketable securities  resulting from the purchases and maturities of those securities  provided million of cash in and used million of cash in we used approximately million of cash in and million of cash in for the purchase of fixed assets and capitalized patent costs 
we used million of cash in for financing activities and generated million of cash from financing activities during stock option exercises and issuance of common stock under the employee stock purchase plan generated million of cash in compared to million of cash in the tax benefits from exercise of stock options generated million of cash in during  million of cash was used to repurchase common stock compared to common stock repurchases of million in at december   we had authority to purchase up to an additional  shares of our common stock under a stock repurchase program for a total of  shares approved by our board of directors in july future repurchases under this authorization could be a use of cash in at december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of establishing off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
we do not believe we are exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
except for our obligations under facilities leases and purchase contracts  we had no material commitments for expenditures as of december  while there were no material commitments  we evaluate investment opportunities that come to our attention and could make a significant commitment in the future 
our cash and equivalents and investments totaled million at december  we believe that on hand cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  coupled with anticipated future cash flow from operations  will be adequate to fund our cash flow needs for the foreseeable future  including contractual obligations discussed below 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
december  in s total less than year years after years contractual obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations we lease a  square foot mixed office and warehouse facility built to our specifications in golden valley  minnesota  which functions as our corporate headquarters and primary manufacturing facility 
the lease for this space is set to expire in june purchase obligations are defined as agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding 
included in the purchase obligations category above are obligations related to purchase orders for inventory purchases under our standard terms and conditions and under negotiated agreements with vendors and utilities 
we expect to receive consideration products or services for these purchase obligations 
the purchase obligation amounts do not represent all anticipated purchases in the future  but represent only those items for which we are contractually obligated 
the majority of our products and services are purchased as needed  with no contractual commitment 
consequently  these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of our expected future cash outflows on a stand alone basis 

table of contents related party transactions we did not engage in any related party transactions during the three year period ended december  inflation and foreign currency translation changes in our revenues have resulted primarily because of changes in the level of unit shipments and the relative strength of the worldwide electronics and semiconductor fabrication capital equipment markets 
we believe that inflation has not had a significant effect on our operations 
all of our international export sales are negotiated  invoiced and paid in us dollars 
accordingly  although currency fluctuations do not significantly affect our revenue and income per unit  they can influence the price competitiveness of our products and the willingness of existing and potential customers to purchase units 
in general  because the dollar has declined during the past few years relative to local currency  the currency fluctuations have enhanced our competitive position 
this has been largely offset by the entrance of other companies in our markets who compete with us on the basis of price 
we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature near the last day of each quarter  and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   we had one open swap agreement that was purchased on december  as a result  any unrealized gains or losses as of december  were inconsequential 
during the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of approximately million from settlement of foreign currency swap agreements that offset the approximately million transaction gain on the underlying inter company balance 
we have sales offices located in the uk  singapore  and china 
we do not believe that currency fluctuations will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
recent accounting developments in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes 
fasb interpretation no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of the interpretation to have a significant impact on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
will apply whenever another standard requires or permits assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances  and is effective beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  intangible assets  and income taxes 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the estimates and judgments that we believe have the most effect on our reported financial position and results of operations are as follows revenue recognition revenue from all customers  including distributors  is recognized when all significant contractual obligations have been satisfied and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
generally  revenues are recognized upon shipment under fob shipping point terms 
estimated returns and warranty costs are recorded at the time of sale 
sales of some surface mount technology smt products may require customer acceptance due to performance or other acceptance criteria included in the terms of sale 
for these smt product sales  revenue is recognized at the time of customer acceptance 
when a sale involves multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each respective element in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
allocation of revenue to undelivered elements of the arrangement is based on fair value of the element being sold on a stand alone basis 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components and excludes amortization of intangible assets 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider specific accounts  historical write offs  changes in customer relationships and credit worthiness and concentrations of credit risk 
specific accounts receivable are written off once a determination is made that the account is uncollectible 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is million as of december  allowance for warranty expenses 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
the allowance for warranties is million at december  reserve for inventory obsolescence 
we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  or if in the future we decide to discontinue sales and marketing of any of our products  additional inventory write downs may be required 
at december   we had a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of million 

table of contents valuation of intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets  long lived assets and related goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important  which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results 
significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business 
significant negative industry or economic trends 
significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
for intangible assets and long lived assets  if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows from such asset 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate that we believe is commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
annually  we also test for impairment of goodwill for each of our reporting units by estimating their fair value  utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology to determine a reasonable valuation 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
deferred tax assets 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets as a result of foreign net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between taxable income on our tax returns and income before income taxes under us generally accepted accounting principals 
a deferred tax asset generally represents future tax benefits to be received when these carryforwards can be applied against future taxable income or when expenses previously reported in our financial statements become deductible for income tax purposes 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets and the need for a valuation allowance based on statement of financial accounting standards no 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
our decision to record the valuation allowance was based on the cumulative losses we had incurred over the three years prior to that date  the fact that we were continuing to generate operating losses and that we fully utilized our loss carryback benefit in from the third quarter of through the third quarter of  we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against all future tax benefits produced by our operating results 
during the fourth quarter of  we reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets initially established in the third quarter of  resulting in a non cash income tax benefit of million 
we considered a number of factors in our decision to reduce the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in  and our ongoing assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets in  including our anticipated level of profitability in the future  our history of recent profitability and cumulative profitability since inception  and utilization of our available us based net operating loss carryforwards 
after considering these factors  we concluded that a reduction in the valuation allowance was appropriate in accordingly the benefit we will derive in future accounting periods from deductible temporary differences has been reflected as a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest excess funds not required for current operations in marketable securities 
the investment policy for these marketable securities is approved annually by the board of directors and administered by management 
a third party  approved by our board of directors  manages the portfolio at the direction of our management 
the investment policy dictates that marketable securities consist of us government or us government agency securities  various tax exempt securities or certain approved corporate instruments with maturities of five years or less and an average portfolio maturity of not more that months 
as of december  our portfolio of marketable securities had an average term to maturity of less than one year 
all marketable securities are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
we estimate that a hypothetical increase in market interest rates would decrease the market value of our marketable securities by approximately million 
if such a rate increase occurred  our net income would only be impacted if securities were sold prior to maturity 
we enter into foreign currency swap agreements to hedge short term inter company financing transactions with our subsidiary in the united kingdom 
these currency swap agreements are structured to mature near the last day of each quarter  and are designated as cash flow hedges 
at december   we had one open swap agreement that was purchased on december  as a result  any unrealized gains or losses as of december  were inconsequential 
during the year ended december   we recognized a net loss of approximately million from settlement of foreign currency swap agreements that offset the approximately million transaction gain on the underlying inter company balance 
our foreign currency swap agreements contain credit risk to the extent that our bank counter parties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements 
we minimize such risk by limiting our counter parties to major financial institutions 
we do not expect material losses as a result of defaults by other parties
