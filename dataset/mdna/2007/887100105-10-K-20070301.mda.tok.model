recent developments global reorganization as part of our commitment to better serve our consumers and improve our performance  in december we made a series of organizational changes that will better align our go to market infrastructure with the consumers we seek to serve 
in this context we are assessing our business segment definitions and anticipate that beginning in the second quarter of  we will shift to a reporting structure that mirrors the newly established consumer categories authentic youth  casualgear  outdoor group and industrial 
each of these categories will be led by a president  along with dedicated resources against merchandising  design  sales planning  category marketing and global sales 
the president of each group will report directly to the chief executive officer 
north american apparel licensing agreement in february   we announced that we entered into a licensing agreement with phillips van heusen for the design  sourcing and marketing of apparel in north america under the timberland brand  beginning with the fall line 
excluded from the agreement with phillips van heusen are timberland outdoor performance apparel  which timberland will continue to design  source and market worldwide  as well as timberland pro apparel  which is the subject of an exclusive license agreement with block corporation for the united states and canada 
as a result of our decision to license timberland brand apparel in north america  we will incur a pre tax restructuring charge in the range of million in to cover severance  outplacement services and asset disposal costs associated with implementation of this strategy 
we anticipate 
table of contents that this action will result in cost savings in the range of million in  weighted towards the second half of the year 
these savings have been factored into the company s financial outlook 
executive departures in february   the company also announced that kenneth p 
pucker  executive vice president and chief operating officer  and brian mckeon  executive vice president finance and administration and chief financial officer  will be leaving the company effective march  mr 
pucker has entered into a separation agreement with the company  which provides for a cash payment and the vesting of certain shares previously awarded under the company s incentive compensation plans

pucker but not vested upon termination 
overview our principal strategic goal is to become the authentic outdoor brand of choice globally 
we continue to develop a diverse portfolio of footwear  apparel and accessories that reinforces the functional performance  benefits and classic styling that consumers have come to expect from our brand 
we sell our products to consumers who embrace an outdoor inspired lifestyle through high quality distribution channels  including our own retail stores  which reinforce the premium positioning of the timberland brand 
to deliver against our long term goals  we are focused on driving progress on key strategic fronts 
these include enhancing our leadership position in our core footwear business  capturing the opportunity that we see for outdoor inspired apparel  extending enterprise reach through development of new brand platforms and brand building licensing arrangements  expanding geographically and driving operational and financial excellence while setting the standard for commitment to the community and striving to be a global employer of choice 
highlights of our financial performance include the following revenue of  million was relatively flat with the prior year 
gross margin was in  compared to in operating income for the year was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in operating income excluding restructuring charges in both years and including share based employee compensation costs related to stock option and employee stock purchase plans in was million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue 
net income was million in compared to million in excluding restructuring charges in both years and including share based employee compensation costs related to stock option and employee stock purchase plans in  net income was million compared to million in diluted earnings per share decreased from in to in excluding restructuring charges in both years and including share based employee compensation costs related to stock option and employee stock purchase plans in  diluted earnings per share decreased from to 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased from million in to million in cash at the end of the year was million with no debt outstanding 
we continue to maintain our focus on serving as a reference for socially responsible companies through our commitment to community 
during the fourth quarter of  we held our annual north american sales meeting in new orleans where we worked in unity with over volunteers to assist in the 
table of contents on going efforts to revitalize the city 
we also remain committed to being an employer of choice as demonstrated by our recognition for the tenth consecutive year in fortune magazine s list of best companies to work for 
for  we are targeting solid growth across our casual  outdoor and industrial categories 
we are also committed to improving performance in our boots and kids businesses  supported by a disciplined product supply and distribution strategy that is aligned with the premium position the company seeks to maintain with consumers 
in this context  we expect to see continued significant declines in boots and kids sales in  likely in excess of million globally 
these impacts will likely limit overall revenue to prior year levels for the full year 
lower boots and kids sales and impacts from higher relative product costs are expected to place continued pressure on operating margins  with expectations for potential full year declines in the range of basis points compared to prior year levels excluding restructuring costs 
we expect sales and operating margin pressures will be greater early in given warm winter weather conditions  the lapping of prior year results and macro factors such as the implementation of european union eu anti dumping duties 
we estimate these factors will contribute to a decline in operating profits excluding restructuring costs in the range of million in the first half of  with most of this decline in the first quarter 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns and allowances  realization of outstanding accounts receivable  the carrying value of inventories  derivatives  other contingencies  impairment of assets  incentive compensation accruals  shared based compensation and the provision for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
historically  actual results have not been materially different from our estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates used in applying our critical accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
we have identified the following as critical accounting policies  based on the significant judgments and estimates used in determining the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements sales returns and allowances our revenue consists of sales to wholesale customers including distributors  franchisees and commissioned agents  retail and e commerce store revenues  license fees and royalties 
we record wholesale and e commerce store revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to our customer  based on the terms of sale 
title passes generally upon shipment to or upon receipt by our customer  depending on the country of sale and the agreement with our customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of the sale 
license fees and royalties are recognized as earned per the terms of our licensing and royalty agreements 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated wholesale and retail customer returns and allowances 
we base our estimates on historical rates of customer returns and allowances  as well as the specific identification of outstanding returns and allowances  which are known to us but which have not yet been received 
our total reserves for sales returns and allowances were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the actual amount of customer returns and allowances may differ from our estimates 
if we determine that increases or decreases to sales returns and allowances are appropriate  we record either a reduction or an increase in sales in the period in which we make such a determination 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates for losses relating to our allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate potential losses primarily based upon our historical rate of credit losses and our knowledge of the financial condition of our customers 
our allowances for doubtful accounts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
the increase in our allowances for doubtful accounts reflects erosion in the timeliness of collections in the us and europe 
historically  losses have been within our expectations 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  adjustments may be required to these estimates 
furthermore  we provide for estimated losses resulting from disputes  which arise with respect to the gross carrying value of our receivables 
the settlement or resolution of these differences could result in future changes to these estimates 
if we determine that increases or decreases to the allowance for doubtful accounts are appropriate  we record either an increase or decrease to selling expense in the period in which we make such a determination 
inventory valuation we value our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out or market value 
market value is estimated based upon assumptions made about future demand and retail market conditions 
if we determine that the estimated market value of our inventory is less than the carrying value of the inventory  we provide a reserve for the difference as a charge to cost of sales 
our reserves related to inventory valuation totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
if actual market conditions are more or less favorable than our estimates  adjustments to our inventory reserves may be required 
the adjustments would decrease or increase our cost of sales in the period in which they are recognized 
derivatives we are routinely subject to currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income as we purchase and sell goods in foreign markets in their local currencies 
we use derivative instruments  specifically forward contracts  to hedge a portion of our forecasted foreign currency transactions 
we use our operating budget and forecasts to estimate future economic exposure and to determine the appropriate levels and timing of related hedging transactions 
we closely monitor our foreign currency exposure and adjust our hedge positions accordingly 
our estimates of anticipated transactions could fluctuate over time and could vary from the ultimate transactions see note to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
future operating results could be impacted by adjustments to these estimates 
contingencies in the ordinary course of business  we are involved in legal proceedings involving contractual and employment relationships  product liabilities  trademark rights and a variety of other matters 
we record contingent liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is estimable 
we disclose a contingent liability when there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
estimating probable losses requires analysis and judgment about the potential actions 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
we do not believe that any pending legal proceeding or claims will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
however  if actual or estimated probable future losses exceed our recorded liability  we would record additional expense during the period in which the loss or change in estimate occurred 
long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a long lived asset may be impaired  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows to be derived from the asset to determine whether or not a potential impairment exists 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of future undiscounted cash flows  impairment is calculated as the excess of the carrying value of the asset over the estimate of its fair market 
table of contents value 
we estimate future undiscounted cash flows using assumptions about expected future operating performance 
those estimates of undiscounted cash flows could differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions or changes to business operations 
for and  no significant impairment related to the carrying value of our long lived assets has been recorded 
incentive compensation accruals we use incentive compensation plans to link compensation to the achievement of specific annual performance targets 
we accrue for this liability during each year based on certain estimates and assumptions 
the amount paid  based on actual performance  could differ from our accrual 
share based compensation the company estimates the fair value of its stock option awards and employee stock purchase plan the esp plan rights on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
the black scholes model includes various assumptions  including the expected volatility for stock options and esp plan rights and the expected term of stock options 
these assumptions reflect the company s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of the company s control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  share based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under sfas r could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if the company uses different assumptions in future periods  share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for additional information regarding the company s adoption of sfas r 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board staff position fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards  in the fourth quarter of the company elected to adopt the alternative transition method for purposes of calculating the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon temporary book to tax differences 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions to realize the value of these assets 
if we were unable to generate sufficient future taxable income in these jurisdictions  an adjustment could be required in the net carrying value of the deferred tax assets  which would result in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for any valuation adjustment quarterly 
we estimate the effective tax rate for the full fiscal year and record a quarterly income tax provision in accordance with the anticipated annual rate 
as the fiscal year progresses  the estimate is refined based upon actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this continual estimation process periodically results in a change to the expected effective tax rate for the fiscal year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the year to date provision reflects the expected annual rate 
in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our effective tax rate estimate to from our previous full year estimate of 
we have provided reserves for certain tax matters  both domestic and foreign  which we believe could result in additional tax being due 
our tax reserves total approximately million at december  any additional assessment or reduction of these contingent liabilities will be reflected in the company s effective tax rate

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices that should mitigate a portion of the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we utilize cash from operations and us dollar denominated borrowings to fund our working capital and investment needs 
short term debt  if required  is used to meet working capital requirements and long term debt  if required  is generally used to finance long term investments

cash balances are invested in high grade securities with terms less than three months

we seek to minimize the impact of these foreign currency fluctuations through a risk management program that includes the use of derivative financial instruments  primarily foreign currency forward contracts 
these foreign currency forward contracts will expire in months or less
