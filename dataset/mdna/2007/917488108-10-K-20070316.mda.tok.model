item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations dollar amounts are in thousands except per share amounts  and where noted 
the following comments should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements 
productivity of assets and working capital 
a assets 
year end total assets were  compared to  in the increase was due essentially to an increase in cash and investment balances allowed by a substantial decrease in inventories and receivables coupled with continued excellent operating profitability 
the productivity of total assets average total asset turns  total sales divided by average total assets for the year was consistent with  with both years productivity diluted by the large cash equivalent balances 
year end and cash and investment balances were  and  respectively  representing and of total assets 
year end cash and investment balances increased  after utmd paid  in shareholder dividends   in share repurchases   to meet optionee tax withholding requirements on options exercised in return for option shares  and  in principal repayments for the ireland loan 
excluding average cash and investment balances  average total asset turns in and were and respectively 
in  total assets excluding cash and investment balances will continue to be substantially less than annual sales  which benefits return on average shareholders equity roe 
improvement in total asset turns including cash and investments will depend on the timing of deployment of excess cash and investment balances 
property  plant and equipment pp e assets are comprised of utah  oregon and ireland manufacturing molds  production tooling and equipment  test equipment  computer communications equipment and software  and the utah and ireland facilities 
utmd leases the oregon facility as a result of the cmi acquisition  and a portion of its midvale  utah parking lot 
in  net pp e depreciated book value increased despite the fact that actual depreciation of assets exceeded new capital expenditures by the increase in net pp e was due to currency exchange translation of book value of ireland assets which appreciated in us dollar value terms because of a weaker usd compared to the euro 
even with the weaker usd  consolidated pp e balances increased at a slower rate than the increase in sales  resulting in significantly higher pp e turns 
the current book value of consolidated pp e is of actual acquisition cost  which means that the continued productivity of the company s fixed assets will remain a source of future profitability  given that pp e is in good working order and capable of supporting increased sales activity 
in  depreciation of fixed assets should again equal or exceed new pp e purchases required to sustain current operations 
average inventory turns in increased to from in  meeting management s continuing objective for inventory turns for the first time since losing the baxter oem supply business ten years ago 
the improved turns were the result of a combination of higher sales and lower inventories compared to the end of net after allowance for doubtful accounts year end trade accounts receivable a r balances increased or about at the same time that sales activity increased  improving average days in a r on december  to days  based on q shipments  compared to days at the end of this performance remained well within management s continuing objective of days 
a r over days from invoice date at year end were of a r  up from at the end of the prior year 
the company believes the older a r will be collected or are within its reserve balances for uncollectible accounts 
working capital at year end was  compared to  at year end both of these amounts exceed working capital needs for growth in normal operations 
utmd s current ratio increased to from  mainly due to increases in cash and investments 
since the large majority of the working capital balance is excess cash and cash investments  the current ratio going forward in will depend primarily upon the timing and extent of use of existing cash and investment balances 
the other current asset and current liability components of working capital are expected to remain within management objectives  consistent with and earlier years 
net after accumulated amortization intangible assets  which are comprised of goodwill resulting from acquisitions and the costs of obtaining patents and other intellectual property including technology rights  were  at the end of compared to  sat the end of the goodwill balance of  reduced from time of acquisition  is the result of three acquisitions in  and which were made in cash at conservative valuations 
the reduction was goodwill amortization as a result of utmd using previous gaap through for the purchase method of acquisition accounting 
under current gaap  goodwill is not expensed unless and until the market value of the acquired entity becomes impaired 
the three acquisitions continue to be viable parts of utmd s overall business  representing of total sales in utmd does not expect the goodwill value of the acquisitions to become impaired in other intangible assets decreased in of that decline  resulted from sale of intellectual property rights  which had no impact on the income statement 
the remaining decrease was the result of amortization expense 
net intangible assets at the end of represented of total assets compared to at the end of liabilities 
utmd s current liabilities decreased  and total liabilities decreased  from the end of to the end of the resulting ending total debt ratio was of total assets  down from a total debt ratio of at the end of current liabilities declined because of a normal fluctuation in timing of payments of accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the long term ireland note payable  which is denominated in euros  declined just in book value despite actual principal payments of  because of the decline in the value of the usd 
in euros  the note declined from  at the beginning of to  at the end of as a reminder to shareholders  the note was initiated in december to finance repatriation of profits achieved in ireland since under the american jobs creation act of utmd ltd 
plans to repay this note from profits generated in ireland over about the next four years 
in addition to liabilities  utmd has operating lease and purchase obligations described in note results of operations 
a revenues 
global consolidated sales increased in compared to the prior year 
foreign international sales increased 
increases and decreases in us domestic sales categories essentially offset each other 
domestic sales were  in compared to  in and  in utmd divides its domestic sales into two distribution channels direct sales which are sales to end user customers by utmd s direct sales force  independent commissioned sales reps  specialty distributors and national hospital distribution companies  and oem sales which are component sales to other companies where products are packaged and resold as part of another company s finished product offerings 
as a percentage of total domestic sales  direct sales in were of domestic sales compared to in and in therefore domestic oem sales were of domestic sales in both and  and of domestic sales in domestic oem sales were up at  in  compared to  in and  in domestic direct sales in were essentially the same as in  and represented of global consolidated sales in compared to in both and international sales were  in compared to  in and  in  and were of global consolidated sales in compared to in both and of the international sales  were distributed to customers in europe  compared to in and in ireland operations utmd ltd 
shipped of international sales in usd terms in  compared to in and in utmd ltd 
shipments  including intercompany sales of subassemblies to midvale  were up in euro terms and up in usd terms compared to utmd groups its sales into four general product line categories obstetrics  comprised of labor and delivery management tools for monitoring fetal and maternal well being  for reducing risk in performing difficult delivery procedures and for improving clinician and patient safety  gynecology electrosurgery urology  comprised of tools for gynecological procedures associated primarily with cervical uterine disease including letz  endometrial sampling  diagnostic laparoscopy  and other mis procedures  specialty excision and incision tools  conservative urinary incontinence therapy devices  and urology tools  neonatal care  comprised of devices that provide developmentally friendly care to the most critically ill babies including providing vascular access  administering vital fluids  maintaining a neutral thermal environment  providing protection and assisting in specialized applications  and blood pressure monitoring accessories other  comprised of specialized components as well as molded parts sold on an oem basis to other companies 
in these four categories  utmd s primary revenue contributors often enjoy a dominant market share and may have differentiated product features protected by patents 
global revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
international revenues by product category obstetrics gynecology electrosurgery urology neonatal blood pressure monitoring and accessories total includes molded components sold to oem customers 
as a brief explanation of revenues in the above tables  of the decline in total obstetrics sales in  was from lower sales of vacuum assisted delivery systems vads  a decline  and from lower iupc sales  a decline 
the lower vads and iupc sales resulted primarily from a trend in obstetrics practice that favors abdominal operative deliveries over vaginal operative deliveries because of medical malpractice litigation risk  and increased competition including effects of gpo product bundling agreements 
cheaper priced  less clinically effective products represent significant competition where hospital administrators are constrained by gpo contracts or may not take the total cost of care into consideration  including increased risk of complications and utilization rates 
gynecology electrosurgery urology product sales increased or  with of the increase coming from higher electrosurgical generator and electrode sales 
consolidated global neonatal product sales increased or in the international portion of neonatal product sales grew  and represented of the increase 
domestic blood pressure monitoring and accessories bpm sales increased  while international bpm sales increased 
looking forward to  utmd s improvement in sales depends on its continued ability to maintain medical staff involvement in purchasing decisions for utmd s physician preference products used in us hospitals where administrators are increasingly making the product decisions through the use of anticompetitive gpos contracts  continued expansion in clinical acceptance of its newer specialty products  release of new products after fda concurrence with premarketing submissions and continued development of utmd s international distribution channels 
excluding the possibility of addition of a product line with established sales  management projects a overall revenue increase in b gross profit 
utmd s gross profit  the surplus after subtracting costs of manufacturing  inspecting  packaging  sterilizing and shipping products cgs from net revenues  was  compared to  in and  in gross profit margins gpms  gross profits expressed as a percentage of net sales  were in compared to in both and the lower gpm in reflects inflation in wages and raw material cost  particularly in ireland where at the same time costs increased  unit sales prices declined in usd terms because of a weaker dollar 
in addition  from a sales channel mix perspective  the increase in sales came predominantly from international sales at relatively lower than average unit selling prices 
utmd continues to retain facilities and other manufacturing capabilities in excess of its needs 
as a result  it projects that the dilution of fixed overhead costs that will occur with increased sales in will help mitigate a continuing expected increase in incremental direct material and labor costs together with some competitive pressure on prices 
also  the company will move much of the intercompany work performed in ireland during the last few years back to the us and offset the loss of that work in ireland with expected continued increases in international trade sales  yielding an overall gpm in comparable to oem sales are sales of utmd components and subassemblies that are marketed by other companies as part of their product offerings 
utmd utilizes oem sales as a means to help maximize utilization of its capabilities established to satisfy its direct sales business 
as a general rule  prices for oem sales expressed as a multiple of direct variable manufacturing expenses are lower than for direct sales because  in the oem and international channels  utmd s business partners incur significant expenses of sales and marketing 
because of utmd s small size and period to period fluctuations in oem business activity  allocations of fixed manufacturing overhead expenses cannot be meaningfully allocated between direct and oem sales 
therefore  utmd does not report gpm by sales channels 
c operating profit 
operating profit  or income from operations  is the surplus after operating expenses are subtracted from gross profits 
operating expenses include sales and marketing s m expenses  product development r d expenses and general and administrative g a expenses 
combined operating expenses were  in  compared to  in and  in in  operating profit includes other operating income  net of associated expenses  resulting from utmd s patent infringement victory over tyco 
litigation expenses are included as part of g a expenses 
the decline in total operating expenses in was due primarily to the favorable conclusion of the fda litigation in late  as noted in the table below r d expenses s m expenses g a fda litigation expenses g a stock option expense g a all other expenses g a expenses total total operating expenses operating profits in were  utmd s operating profit margin operating profits divided by total sales was in  compared to in and in the and margins do not correlate to sales since there were substantial expenses and or other income in those two years that were unrelated to sales 
excluding the other operating income related to patent infringement damages and fda litigation expenses  operating profits would have been  and  and operating profit margins would have been and  in and respectively  which management believes is a better measure of operating profits relative to sales activity in the prior two years 
looking forward to  utmd expects to control operating expenses  excluding consideration for litigation expenses which are less predictable  at a level below of sales  yielding a operating profit margin consistent with i s m expenses s m expenses are the costs of communicating utmd s differences and product advantages  providing training and other customer service in support of the use of utmd s solutions  attending clinical meetings and medical trade shows  processing orders and funding gpo fees 
because utmd sells internationally through third party distributors  its s m expenses are predominantly for us business activity where it sells directly to clinical users 
the largest component of s m expenses is the cost of directly employing representatives that provide customer support coverage across the us as a percent of total sales  s m operating expenses were in  in and in in  utmd intends to continue to manage s m expenses to less than of total sales 
ii r d expenses r d expenses include the costs of investigating clinical needs  developing innovative concepts  testing concepts for viability  validating methods of manufacture  completing premarketing regulatory documentation and other activities required for design control  responding to customer requests for product enhancements  and assisting manufacturing engineering on an ongoing basis in developing new processes or improving existing processes 
as a percent of sales  r d expenses were in compared to in and in in  utmd will opportunistically invest in r d in order to reinvigorate its product development pipeline 
iii g a expenses g a expenses include the front office functional costs of executive management  finance and accounting  corporate information systems  human resources  shareholder relations  risk management  protection of intellectual property  and legal costs 
starting in  g a expenses also included estimated stock option compensation expense  which was  as required by new accounting rules 
in addition to employing the personnel required to coordinate or manage those front office functions  g a expenses include outside director fees and costs  outside legal counsels and litigation experts fees  independent accounting audit fees including auditing for internal controls under sox  k plan administration  nasdaq exchange fees  write offs of uncollectible receivables  general business insurance and corporate contributions to charitable organizations 
aggregate g a expenses as a percent of sales were in  in and in g a expenses excluding all litigation expenses were  and of sales in  and  respectively  which may provide a clearer comparison of g a expense ratios 
total litigation expenses in the three years of were  of which the expenses associated with the unwarranted fda lawsuit were  the balance was due to expenses associated with defense or prosecution of patent infringement claims 
there were no litigation expenses during the three years related to product liability 
utmd plans to hold g a expenses at a level about of sales  excluding any currently unexpected significant litigation costs 
iv other operating income other operating income in resulted from utmd s patent infringement victory over tyco 
in january  the company received a payment of  in damages and interest resulting from a district federal court judgment  and a post judgment settlement 
the company recognized other operating income of  in first quarter and  net of expenses in fourth quarter in  an unexpected favorable result would occur if the government does the right thing and accepts utmd s claims for damages for the fda s abuse of process in d non operating income  non operating expense and ebt 
non operating income includes royalties from licensing utmd s technology to other companies  rent from leasing underutilized property to others  income earned from investing the company s excess cash and gains or losses from the sale of assets  offset by non operating expenses which include interest expenses and bank fees 
non operating income was  in  in and in the significant increase in resulted from capital gains  corporate dividends and interest from utmd investing its excess cash which exceeded royalties received were in all three years  which came from one source 
the licensed patents for which the royalties were received are due to expire in mid in  utmd paid for interest compared to in and none in the interest in and resulted from borrowing million  in december to facilitate the repatriation in of profits generated by utmd s ireland operations since utmd expects interest expense of about in as a result of the ireland note payable 
although average loan balances will be lower in  the interest rate will be higher and utmd expects the average conversion rate of the usd from the euro will be weaker than in  resulting in about the same amount of usd interest 
management expects non operating income will be about lower in than in because the company s cash is now invested solely in short term money market instruments 
in  utmd realized in capital gains when liquidating its investments in equities 
the actual amount of non operating income may be even lower if utmd utilizes excess cash for an acquisition  unexpected litigation costs or substantial share repurchases 
earnings before income taxes ebt result from adding utmd s non operating income to its operating profits 
ebt was  in compared to  in and  in ebt margin is ebt divided by total sales 
utmd s ebt margin was  and in  and  respectively 
excluding the tyco income  the ebt margin would have been  which management believes is a better indicator of ebt in that year 
given projections as previously noted  management is targeting ebt about the same as  as the expected lower non operating income will be offset by higher consolidated operating profits 
e net income  eps and roe 
net income is ebt minus income taxes  often called the bottom line 
net income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the effective income tax rate was  and respectively 
the significantly lower income tax provision in was a result of the american jobs creation act of the act enacted in october which allowed a temporary tax deduction on repatriated foreign earnings accomplished in prior to  utmd included a deferred tax liability in reported results  anticipating that profits generated by its ireland facility would eventually be repatriated  triggering us income taxes 
also  utmd recorded a favorable deferred tax liability adjustment after the conclusion of an irs audit in q these were non recurring tax benefits limited to the year which provided the much lower tax provision in that year 
other year to year fluctuations in the tax rate may result from variations in profits of the ireland subsidiary which is taxed at a rate on exported manufactured products and a rate on rental income  extraterritorial income eti exclusions  higher marginal tax rates for ebt above million  and other factors such as r d tax credits 
management expects the consolidated income tax rate to increase in because the eti exclusion has been repealed 
utmd s net income expressed as a percentage of sales was  and for years  and  respectively 
utmd s profitability has consistently ranked in the top performance tier of all us publicly traded companies  and has been a primary driver for utmd s past excellent returns on shareholders equity roe 
earnings per share eps is net income divided by the number of shares of stock outstanding diluted to take into consideration stock option awards which are in the money  ie  have exercise prices below the applicable period s weighted average market value 
diluted eps were  and in  and  respectively 
utmd s eps has grown at an annually compounded rate of per year during the nine years since the end of weighted average number of diluted common shares the number used to calculate diluted eps were  in thousands compared to  shares in and  shares in dilution for in the money unexercised options for the year was in thousands shares compared to in and in the total number of options outstanding at year end declined from year end dilution decreased in from because the average number of options outstanding decreased substantially  even though a higher average share price in the stock market increased the dilution effect of each option 
actual outstanding common shares as of december  were  return on shareholders equity roe is the portion of net income retained by utmd after payment of dividends to internally finance its growth  divided by the average accumulated shareholders equity during the applicable time period 
roe includes balance sheet measures as well as income statement measures 
roe in was before dividends  the same as in compared to and  roe in was helped by lower litigation costs 
a higher net profit margin in was offset by higher dividends to shareholders and lower financial leverage 
asset turns remained about the same 
roe in was before dividends and before dividends in the roe was aided by tyco patent infringement damages 
utmd s roe before dividends has averaged per year over the last years 
this ratio determines how fast the company can afford to grow without diluting shareholder interests 
for example  a roe will financially support annual growth in revenues without issuing more stock 
looking forward  unless utmd utilizes its cash to make an acquisition or repurchase shares  roe will be lower than because net profitability is projected to remain about the same while average shareholders equity and dividends increase and asset turns and financial leverage decrease 
retaining a high cash balance which returns only about dilutes overall roe 
liquidity and capital resources 
cash flows 
net cash provided by operating activities  including adjustments for depreciation and other non cash operating expenses  along with changes in working capital and the tax benefit attributable to exercise of employee incentive stock options  totaled  in compared to  in and  in compared to  net cash provided by operating activities was enhanced in by an increase of in net profits  a substantial tax benefit of  from the exercise of employee options compared to in and in and excellent balance sheet management by decreasing inventories  receivables and other current assets in the presence of higher sales activity 
in  the major contributor was a receivable of about million from tyco international for patent infringement 
the company s use of cash for investing activities was primarily as a result of purchases of liquid investments  in an effort to maximize returns on excess cash balances while maintaining safety and liquidity 
utmd expended  in on such purchases  compared to  in and  in in  utmd received  from selling short term investments  compared to  in and  in no cash acquisitions were made in or utmd invested  in second quarter to acquire abcorp  inc  its vendor for fetal monitoring belts 
please see the table under supplemental disclosure of cash flow information for more detail of the abcorp assets purchased 
in  utmd received and issued  shares of stock upon the exercise of employee and director stock options 
employees and directors exercised a total of  option shares in  with  shares immediately being retired as a result of the individuals trading the shares in payment of the exercise price of the options and related tax withholding subject to statutory limitations 
utmd paid  in to meet tax withholding requirements on options exercised 
utmd repurchased  shares of stock in the open market at a cost of  during option exercises in were at an average price of per share 
share repurchases in the open market were at an average cost of per share  including commissions and fees 
in comparison  in utmd received from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee and director stock options  including  shares retired upon employees and directors trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price and related tax withholding 
in  the company received  from issuing  shares of stock on the exercise of employee and director stock options  including  shares retired upon employees trading those shares in payment of the stock option exercise price 
in december  utmd s foreign subsidiary borrowed million  to finance repatriation from ireland to the us of profits achieved since under the american jobs creation act of utmd did not borrow during or in  utmd made repayments of  on the ireland note 
although utmd has not borrowed under its revolving line of credit since it paid off the balance in  the line of credit is used to guarantee the current ireland loan in order to achieve the most favorable credit terms 
management believes that future income from operations and effective management of working capital will provide the liquidity needed to finance internal growth plans 
planned capital expenditures are expected to be less than to keep facilities  equipment and tooling in good working order 
in addition  utmd may use cash in for selective infusions of technological  marketing or product manufacturing rights to broaden the company s product offerings  for continued share repurchases if the price of the stock becomes undervalued  and if available for a reasonable price  acquisitions that may strategically fit utmd s business and are accretive to performance 
the revolving line of credit will continue to be available for liquidity when the timing of acquisitions or repurchases of stock require a large amount of cash in a short period of time not otherwise available from existing cash and investment balances 
in summary  management plans to utilize cash not needed to support normal operations in one or a combination of the following to make investments in new technology and or processes  to acquire a product line that will augment revenue growth and better utilize utmd s existing infrastructure  and or to repurchase utmd shares in the open marketplace 
management s outlook 
in summary  in utmd plans to retain the significant us market shares of key products  and continue growth of newer products  add proprietary products helpful to clinicians through internal new product development  continue to disproportionately increase international sales  make effective adjustments to intracompany manufacturing operations to minimize consolidated manufacturing costs  continue outstanding overall financial operating performance  look for new acquisitions to augment sales growth  and utilize current cash balances in shareholders best long term interest 
the reliability and performance of utmd s products is high and represent significant clinical benefits while providing minimum total cost of care 
physicians do care about the well being of their patients  but their time is limited to evaluate choices  and they have hospital administrators to deal with who often look at the initial price of a product without understanding the total cost of care which includes risk of unwanted complications and unnecessary utilization 
in the us  utmd will continue to leverage its reputation as an innovator which will responsively take on challenges to work with physicians who use its products in specialty hospital areas  or outside the hospital in their office practices 
internationally  where utmd must depend on the knowledge  focus  relationships and energy of independent distributors  management will continue to closely monitor performance and recruit needed business partners 
utmd will continue to focus on differentiating itself  especially from commodity oriented competitors 
utmd is small  but its employees are experienced and diligent in their work 
our passion is in providing innovative clinical solutions that will help reduce health risks for women and their babies 
the company has a defined focus and does not seek revenue growth as its primary motivation 
we fundamentally seek to do an excellent job in meeting our customers and their patients needs  and provide our shareholders with excellent returns 
looking back five years from the end of to the end of  utmd s eps have increased while the year ending share price has more than doubled up 
in comparison  the nasdaq composite  s p index and djia indices were all up only about over that same time span 
over the most recent five year period  utmd s share price appreciated six times the rate of increase of the major indices  providing long term shareholders with excellent returns 
in  while the year ending share price only increased  utmd increased dividends share paid to shareholders by  and decreased outstanding unexercised options by 
diluted shares outstanding declined about 
this was achieved in by utmd again demonstrating a high positive cash flow by meeting its operational goals  managing working capital effectively and keeping new capital expenditures below the rate of depreciation of existing assets 
utmd s balance sheet is strong enough to be able to finance a substantial acquisition in without issuing stock  should an attractive one become available 
in considering acquisitions  utmd looks to acquire successful companies  products or technologies that will enhance its specialist focus  but not significantly increase its business risk and not dilute its financial performance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience  current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
management has identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies which require significant judgment and estimates 
although management believes its estimates are reasonable  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the majority of the company s receivables are with hospitals and medical device distributors 
although the company has historically not had significant write offs of bad debt  the possibility exists  particularly with foreign customers where collection efforts can be difficult or in the event of widespread us hospital bankruptcies 
inventory valuation reserves the company strives to maintain a good balance of inventory to meets its customer s needs while not tying up an unnecessary amount of the company s resources increasing the possibility of  among other things  obsolescence 
the company believes its method of reviewing actual and projected demand for its existing inventory allows it to arrive at a fair inventory valuation reserve 
while the company has historically not had significant inventory write offs  the possibility exists that one or more of its products may become unexpectedly obsolete for which a reserve has not previously been created 
the company s historical write offs have not been materially different from its estimates 
accounting policy changes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this statement clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions 
the provisions of fin will be effective for utmd starting in first quarter  with the cumulative effect of the change  if material  recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
management is currently evaluating the impact of fin on the consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company had manufacturing operations  including related assets  in ireland denominated in the euro  and sold products under agreements denominated in various western european currencies 
the euro and other currencies have been and are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that are beyond the control of utmd 
the exchange rate for the euro was  
and 
per us dollar as of december   and  respectively 
please see note in item   below under translation of foreign currencies for more information 
utmd manages its foreign currency risk without separate hedging transactions by converting currencies as transactions occur
