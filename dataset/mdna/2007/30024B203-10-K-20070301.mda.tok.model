item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with  and are qualified by reference to  our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in item of this report and selected financial data included in item of this report 
certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to current year presentation 
certain statements set forth below under this caption constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform of refer to the cautions about forward looking statements preceding item of this report 
also  for a discussion of certain risk factors applicable to our business and operations see risk factors in item a of this report 
overview we are leveraging a vertically integrated  coal based platform to deliver combined energy  environmental and economic solutions  producing clean  efficient and affordable energy 
we intend to meet the specific needs of industrial  international and public utility market customers 
we provide economical solutions to environmental emission standards compared to other emission standard alternatives 
our proprietary k fuel process uses heat and pressure to physically and chemically transform high moisture  low btu coals  such as subbituminous coal and lignite  into a more energy efficient  lower emission fuel 
the pre combustion refinement of raw coal into k fuel refined coal reduces mercury content up to percent and upon combustion  sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxides by significant amounts 
studies show that the increased efficiency of k fuel refined coal will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by beneficial amounts 
the following discussion is focused on the recent events that we believe have the most significant impact on our business 
on february   we received the results of test burns conducted at the university of notre dame 
these test burns were conducted and monitored by an independent third party 
we blended percent and percent of k fuel refined coal with high sulfur  low fusion eastern ohio bituminous coal 
test burns using percent of our k fuel refined coal were also conducted 
blended results indicated improvements in emissions that could help coal fired boilers comply with the new federal industrial boiler maximum achievable control technology rule for emissions while maintaining load capacities through higher btu values 
using only k fuel refined coal resulted in reduced chloride emission by percent sulfur dioxide emissions by percent and reduced the mercury content by percent when compared to the high sulfur  low fusion eastern ohio bituminous coal 
on december   we received the test burn results of blending k fuel refined coal with high sulfur ohio coal 
the test burns were conducted with the city of painesville  ohio department of utilities 
the results indicated compliance with a new federal clean air standard for industrial coal fired boiler that goes into effect in emissions included pounds of particulate matter per million btu s generated  pounds of hydrogen chloride per million btu s generated and nine pounds of mercury per trillion btus generated 
on december   we signed agreements with two major utilities to advance the integration of several k direct coal refineries in both existing and new coal power plants 
we completed the initial construction and are in the start up phase for our fort union k fuel plant and mine site project in wyoming s powder river basin  which is our first plant implementing the k fuel process 
on september   we listed our common stock on the nyse arca platform under the new ticker symbol eee 
on september   in keeping with our strategy to use technology to create cleaner coal for generating power  we began doing business as evergreen energy inc on september   we signed an agreement with bechtel power corporation for plant engineering  standardization and design optimization for our k fuel refined coal plants 
the agreement provides for engineering services in the areas of architecture  civil structural  mechanical  electrical  and controls  including subsystems engineering and design for our future k fuel and k direct commercial plants 
effective february   this agreement was amended and restated to include engineering  procurement and construction contracts for building several k direct plants that are currently being evaluated by us 
on august   we shipped our first unit train of k fuel refined coal 
on june   we purchased a  pound per hour circulating fluidized bed coal fired boiler island 
we have unexercised options to purchase two more coal fired boiler islands 
the fixed price for this first coal fired boiler island is million 
as we are primarily focused on the construction of k direct facilities in the near term  we are evaluating alternatives for this boiler  including potentially selling it to a third party 
on june   we entered into a long term marketing  distribution and transportation logistics services agreement with dte coal services  inc on april   we completed the acquisition of buckeye industrial mining co  which continues our strategy to transition from an energy technology company into an energy production company 
in february  we sold approximately million shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share pursuant to a follow on common stock offering  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million 
our consolidated financial statements include all of our wholly owned subsidiaries  including the nine months ended december   for buckeye industrial mining co 
acquisition date of april  
with the acquisition of buckeye  we have expanded our segments and our segment presentation 
we have identified three segments our plant and licensing segment  mining segment and operating segment 
our results of operations are evaluated and allocations of capital resources are based upon the vertical integration and operation of these segments 
the plant and licensing segment represents revenue and costs related to the use and application of our proprietary  patented k fuel process and our mine site in gillette  wyoming 
the mining segment represents our mining operations at our buckeye location and includes certain marketing personnel  the ash disposal facility  the blending facility and mines 
the operating segment is comprised of all other operations 
we incorporate the acquisition of buckeye into our overall strategy and therefore  we do not operate or evaluate it as other stand alone coal mining operations might 
the value of buckeye to us is its marketing team and strategic location  rail road loading facility  port dock loading facility on the ohio river  blending facility and mines and coal reserves 
our analysis presented below is organized in a way that provides the information required  while highlighting the information that we believe will be instructive for understanding the results of our operations and relevant trends 
discussions of our results related to our segments are presented in the context of our overall results and  unless otherwise indicated  relate to our operating segment 
we will continue to evaluate how we manage our business and  as necessary  adjust our segment reporting accordingly 
significant trends for the last several years  our operations have been focused on developing our technology and the construction of the fort union plant 
as a result  we have limited revenues from k fuel refined coal and  historically most of our costs are related to general and administrative expenses 
with the addition of buckeye  we have begun to generate revenue and incurred more substantial mining costs 
in the future  we plan to construct  own and operate k direct and k fuel production facilities domestically  both wholly owned and through joint ventures  as well as to license the k fuel technology to third parties  primarily internationally 
as our operations expand  we expect our revenue and cost structure will also increase 
the following discussion and analysis is focused on the events and trends that we believe have or will in the future have the most significant impact on our business 
revenue trends in the future we expect to generate revenue from the following sources revenues from production facilities including k direct and k fuel plants  coal sales from blending our k fuel refined coal with other mined coal  coal sales from our buckeye operations  licensing of our technology  including license fees for constructing a plant and royalty fees for operating a plant  and consulting services to parties who license our technology 
the value and pricing of our k fuel refined coal is evolving 
over time  as the market for our product develops  we will adjust the price at which we sell our refined coal 
we may be able to charge a premium for k fuel refined coal in certain industries and different geographic regions of the united states 
conversely  we may be required to sell k fuel refined coal to customers at substantially discounted rates so customers can test combustion  emissions and coal handling through their own systems 
additionally  we may process raw coal provided by potential customers through our fort union plant to assess the removal of mercury and reductions in the emission of carbon dioxide  sulfur dioxide  nitrogen oxides and various product handling aspects at little or no cost to the potential customers 
in addition  to the extent that we execute on our vertical integration strategy and acquire companies that conform to our business strategy  we anticipate revenues from those sources as well 
we have granted certain rights and limited licenses for the use of certain k fuel technology  which may limit our revenue from production of k fuel refined coal to the extent that the rights are exercised 
expense trends plant costs we have completed the initial construction and entered the plant start up phase of our fort union plant in gillette  wyoming 
plant start up costs were higher than anticipated and production was less than anticipated due to general start up issues with this first of a kind plant and the acceleration of initial production runs 
the commissioning of the facility at this accelerated pace resulted in a number of plant operating inefficiencies 
to eliminate these inefficiencies and optimize the facility  we are continuously modifying  testing  reconfiguring and improving the plant 
we believe that the start up costs incurred are not indicative of future continuous operations and that start up costs will trend downward in future periods 
as our fort union plant begins continuous operation and future potential k direct and k fuel plants are constructed  we will incur additional expenses  the most significant on a per ton basis are raw material costs  coal transportation costs  outsourced engineering and technical support  fluid processing costs  by product and water disposal costs  royalty costs  relating to fees we owe to parties who own certain rights that support our patents and proprietary technology  primarily the koppelman estate 
see further discussion of the royalty owed to the estate of edward koppelman in note deferred royalty costs in item of this report coal mining operating expenses with the acquisition of buckeye we expect to incur mine operating expenses including all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility 
additionally  as our fort union plant obtains continuous production  we expect to blend our k fuel refined coal with prepared and raw coal at buckeye s facility and incur the associated shipping and blending costs 
general and administrative expenses as we continue to pursue vertical integration through acquisitions and joint ventures and generally expand our business including hiring additional personnel at our corporate and plant locations and outsourced professional services  we will incur additional expenses  the most significant of which are non cash  share based compensation  payroll and related burdens  rent and utilities  and professional support fees 
we anticipate that accounting for non cash  share based compensation will add approximately million to million per year in the foreseeable future to our expenses 
in the event we should achieve certain performance goals  we would significantly accelerate recognition of these costs 
costs such as payroll and related burdens  professional support fees and utilities are variable costs that increase with size and the location 
as we expand our vertical integration strategy we expect these costs increase in future periods 
results of operations revenue revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to  for the same period ended december  substantially all the increase was due to our acquisition of buckeye  which resulted in million of revenue in our mining segment for the nine months ended december  acquisition date of april  
the fluctuations are as follows  coal revenue includes mined raw and prepared coal sales within our buckeye operations 
buckeye coal sales  including transportation costs charged to customers  were million or sales realization per ton sold for the nine months ended december  acquisition date of april  
brokered coal sales net  include the revenues reduced by costs associated with the purchase of coal from other coal producers  which we ship directly to customers 
we recognized  of net revenue for the nine months ended december  acquisition date of april  in our mining segment 
ash disposal revenue includes revenue generated from the disposal of coal combustion bi products at our ash pit in ohio 
ash disposal revenues were million for the nine months ended december  acquisition date of april   in our mining segment 
during the year ended december   we recognized  of revenue related to shipments of k fuel refined coal in our plant and licensing segment 
k fuel refined coal sales were less than expected primarily due to less production at our fort union plant 
in addition  we sold a portion of our k fuel refined coal at discounted rates 
in  we entered into a licensing and royalty agreement related to a previous version of our proprietary technology with a third party 
during  the equipment relating to the licensing agreement was placed into service 
as a result of the equipment being placed into service  we received a cash royalty payment for  in the first quarter we recognized  of royalty revenue for in the first quarter of in our plant and licensing segment 
during the second quarter of  we received an annual cash royalty payment for in the amount of  we anticipate that we will only recognize future revenue as circumstances dictate  including the receipt of cash payments 
this licensing agreement expires in we recognized revenue of  from the million up front licensing fee received in december from cook inlet coal llc in our plant and licensing segment for the year ended december  to date we have completed all of our contractual deliverables for the licensing fee and are waiting for cook inlet coal to provide specific site information before the next phase of revenue recognition can commence 
revenues for the years ended december  and were  and  for the year ended december   we recognized  on the million up front licensing fee received in december in our plant and licensing segment as discussed above 
revenues for the period ended december  were insignificant to our operations 
coal mining operating expenses our coal mining operating expenses include all costs associated with the mining of saleable coal and costs relating to our coal ash disposal facility at buckeye  which represents our mining segment 
coal mining operating expenses coal mining operating expenses include employee related costs  outside contracted mining for our underground mines  internal and external coal transportation costs  blasting  drilling  heavy equipment costs  blending costs  coal purchases from others used to blend with our coal and other mining related costs 
coal mining operating expenses were million for the nine months ended december  acquisition date of april  
the increase in mining costs is attributed to the acquisition of buckeye in the second quarter of sfas no 
requires under purchase price accounting that finished goods inventory be valued at estimated selling prices less a reasonable profit allowance for the selling effort and that raw materials be valued at current replacement costs 
we determined that the book value for buckeye s raw material inventory as of april  was equal to current replacement cost 
for finished goods  we increased the inventory to fair value from a book value of million to a fair value of million  for a total increase of  as a direct result of this purchase price adjustment  the sales of buckeye s inventory resulted in a reduction in operating income in our mining operation for the nine months ended december  acquisition date of april  
ash disposal ash disposal expenses include employee related costs  consulting  repairs and maintaining culverts and drainage ponds  transportation  heavy equipment costs and other costs associated with the ash disposal facility 
ash disposal expenses were million for the nine months ended december  acquisition date of april  
general and administrative the following table summarizes our general and administrative costs for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands employee non cash  share based compensation employee related costs non cash  arch warrants professional fees travel and office costs insurance and other total general and administrative employee non cash  share based compensation expenses were million and for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the expenses for relate to i stock options outstanding  ii restricted stock grants  and iii the discount and the fair value calculation for the look back provision for employee stock purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
the increase in non cash  share based compensation was in direct correlation with the adoption of sfas r as of january  see note stock options  stock grants and employee benefit plans for further discussion in item of this report 
non cash  share based compensation in primarily related to restricted stock and option grants to our chief executive officer  chief operating officer and our chief technology officer 
employee related costs primarily include salaries and wages  bonuses  benefits  employer payroll taxes and education and training 
employee related costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increases for the year ended december  were primarily related to an increase in the number of employees  which increased salaries and related burdens 
during  we added personnel in many areas  including engineering and business development 
in addition  the number of employees increased as a result of the buckeye acquisition 
during  we entered into two agreements with arch coal  inc which allowed us to evaluate the potential of constructing and operating a plant at their coal creek mine site and required us to issue warrants 
in  we extended these agreements to allow additional time for the evaluation of the project 
in connection with the extension  the expiration date of the warrants was also extended and  pursuant to sfas r  we were required to recognize an additional million of non cash expense for the year ended december  based on discussions with arch coal  it was mutually agreed not to further extend these agreements 
the first agreement expired on september  and the warrant agreement expired on october  as market conditions and other circumstances change we may enter into new agreements with arch coal 
professional fees include legal  audit and accounting  public relations  governmental relations and similar costs 
professional fees were million and million for the period ended december  and  respectively 
the increases can be attributed to a general overall increase in legal and accounting fees when compared to the same period ended travel and office costs include airfare  lodging  meals  office rent  office supplies  phone and utilities 
travel and office expenses were million as compared to for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of the increase is attributed to our increase in the number of employees at our corporate office and as a result of our acquisition of buckeye 
the increase in the number of employees at our corporate office led to our office expansion in june and the related increases in rent and utilities 
in addition  we increased our travel related to our expanded business development efforts  including travel to our ohio subsidiary and travel to identify potential sites for future plants 
we also saw an increase in travel to our fort union plant site by non plant related employees and management in  as the plant entered the startup phase 
insurance and other costs primarily include costs related to our property and commercial liability  other insurance and all costs that cannot be categorized elsewhere and include  among other costs  various business and franchise taxes  repair and maintenance  director fees and director expenses 
insurance and other costs for the year ended december  were million compared to million for the same period ended the increase can be attributed primarily to an overall increase in property and commercial liability premiums for our fort union plant  and our buckeye operations 
employee non cash  share based compensation expenses were million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
non cash  share based compensation in primarily related to restricted stock and option grants to our current chief executive officer  chief operating officer and our chief technology officer 
employee related costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily related to an increase in the number of employees and related burdens as we hired more employees at our corporate and plant office 
pursuant to agreements we entered into with arch coal  previously described  we issued million warrants in to arch to purchase our common stock at prices ranging from to 
we recognized million of general and administrative expense during the year ended december  related to the warrants 
professional fees were million  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we experienced fluctuations in professional fees due to the following in  we recognized million of non cash expense related to the issuance of stock to a consultant in exchange for services performed 
in there was a million non cash charge for consulting fees relating to assistance with regulatory issues 
travel and office costs were million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in was due to additional non plant related employees and management traveling to our fort union plant site and increased international travel related to visits to lurgi south africa s facilities and other business development opportunities 
additionally  we experienced increases in all aspects of office expense due to the expansion of our business and the increase in the number of employees 
insurance and other expenses were million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
increases were attributed to an overall increase in general and commercial liability premiums for our fort union plant 
plant start up costs plant start up costs include purchased raw materials  coal transportation  outsourced engineering and technical support  fluid processing  by products and water disposal  and employee related costs which are reflected in our plant and licensing segment 
plant start up costs were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
plant start up costs were higher than anticipated due to general start up issues with this first of a kind plant and the acceleration of initial production runs 
the commissioning of the facility at this accelerated pace resulted in a number of plant operating inefficiencies 
we incurred higher feed stock costs as we chose to purchase coal from a nearby mine and incurred trucking costs for the transportation of that purchased coal 
outsourced engineering and employee related costs were incurred to assist with the acceleration of the initial production 
the water handling system was limited in its ability to process water from the production process 
disposal of this excess water required utilizing third parties to transport water to approved disposal sites 
this resulted in higher water disposal costs 
depreciation  depletion and amortization depreciation  depletion and amortization are comprised of depreciation on our fort union plant using the units of production method  based on actual tons processed and depreciation on other fixed assets using the straight line method  depletion  based on actual tons mined at our mine sites in ohio and wyoming  and amortization related to our patents 
depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to  during the same period ended the increases are primarily attributable to the acquisition of buckeye in the second quarter of depreciation  depletion and amortization expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  during the same period ended research and development research and development costs include costs incurred to advance  test  or otherwise modify our proprietary technology or develop new technologies and primarily include costs incurred to operate and maintain our laboratory facilities and professional engineering fees related to off site testing of our k fuel refined coal 
research and development costs were million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the decrease is primarily a result of our fort union plant entering the start up phase of operation  which resulted in costs that were previously classified as research and development now being classified as plant start up costs 
research and development costs were million and  for the years ended and  respectively 
the majority of the increase can be attributed to an increase in the number of employees and related overhead at our laboratory facilities and increases in new technology development and feasibility studies for future large scale plant sites 
the increased activity at our laboratory facilities was indicative of internal coal testing of our k fuel refined coal 
cost of license and consulting revenue cost of license and consulting revenue includes costs to transfer our technology related to licensing and royalty agreements  including amortization of deferred royalty costs  salaries and wages of certain personnel and professional fees 
cost of licensing and consulting revenue was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases in these costs were in direct correlation to the revenue recognized in on the licensing agreement we entered into in cost of licensing and consulting revenue was  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increases in these costs were in direct correlation to the revenue recognized in on the licensing agreement we entered into in bad debt and asset impairment charges bad debt and asset impairment charges were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in  we wrote off  of certain site specific costs  which we were evaluating for a future k fuel facility 
through a series of transactions  pegasus became indebted to us for million 
we have rights to collect payments under this note from pegasus and to demand payment upon certain events of default 
during the year ended december   we determined that pegasus might not have sufficient contracts to continue to meet this obligation 
therefore  we have recorded an allowance for bad debt for the note receivable of million 
despite this allowance  we retain all of our rights to collect payments under this note from pegasus and to demand payment upon certain events of default 
bad debt and asset impairment charges were million for each of the years ended december  and in  we incurred million plant development impairment primarily related to certain site specific and plant size specific costs incurred associated with evaluating three other locations for our fort union plant 
other income expense interest income  net interest income  net was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is attributed to interest earned on our cash balance  which was significantly higher compared to the same period in  primarily as a result of our public stock offering in february of interest income  net was million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase is attributed to interest earned on our cash balance  which was significantly higher compared to the same period in other income expense  net other income expense  net was million for the year ended december  in  we completed an equity exchange transaction pursuant to which we transferred our interest in pegasus technologies  inc for full ownership of k fuel llc  now part of a wholly owned subsidiary named kfx technology  llc 
as a part of this exchange transaction  we exchanged an intercompany working capital loan with pegasus with an outstanding balance of million for a contingent earn out agreement of up to million in the aggregate  plus accrued interest prime rate plus basis points  payable out of a portion of future cash flows generated by pegasus 
due to the contingent nature of this potential stream of future cash flows  we did not recognize an asset or any associated income at the time of the exchange transaction 
as a result of a transfer of ownership interests  the earn out provisions were triggered and we received a payment of million from pegasus as a payment in full satisfaction of the million obligation 
deferred tax benefit we have not reflected a deferred tax benefit  primarily from net operating loss carryforwards  since based on the weight of available evidence  both positive and negative  management has determined that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets may not be realized 
the primary evidence was our history of net operating losses 
as we begin to earn revenue and realize net income  we will continue to evaluate our valuation allowance and at such time as there is sufficient evidence that we will utilize at least some portion of our deferred tax assets  we will reverse a related portion of our valuation allowance 
certain limitations apply to the annual amount of net operating losses that can be used to offset taxable income due to certain ownership changes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
liquidity and capital resources in february  we sold approximately million shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share pursuant to a follow on common stock offering  resulting in net proceeds of approximately million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we used part of the proceeds from this offering to fund the acquisition of buckeye and the construction of our fort union plant 
we plan on using the remaining funds for new k direct and k fuel facility construction costs and general corporate purposes 
our cash will primarily be used to fund operations and for capital expenditures 
the capital expenditure budget for is approximately million to million which will be used for fort union completion costs  buckeye mining and development costs and costs associated with initial k direct facilities 
after completion of the next phase and upon initiation of definitive agreements  future capital costs will be adjusted to reflect the construction of two new k direct facilities 
we believe our cash level is sufficient to support our operations  including the fort union plant  start preliminary site investigation  design  permitting and similar long lead time activities related to k direct plants located on site at coal fired power generating and industrial facilities and other large scale k fuel plants for at least the next twelve months 
however  as we identify strategic opportunities to accelerate construction of k direct and large scale commercial plants  or other agreements such as joint ventures  we will need to obtain additional funding 
we plan to seek additional capital from time to time as needed through equity offerings or the exercise of outstanding options and warrants  debt offerings  partnering with third parties in the construction and operation for some of our large scale commercial plants through the formation of joint ventures  and fees from additional licensing of our k fuel technology 
while we believe we will obtain additional capital through one or more of the alternatives described  we can provide no assurance that any of the alternatives will be available to us or be on terms acceptable to us 
payment obligations the following table summarizes our future commitments as of december  payments due by period thereafter total in thousands operating leases capital lease and other obligations purchase commitment obligations consulting and service commitments total commitments this table does not include accounts payable  accrued expenses nor asset retirement obligations  which are reported in our december  consolidated balance sheets 
we generally have not included any obligation in which either party has the right to terminate except as discussed below 
additionally  we have not included royalty payments  as we cannot presently determine when such payments will be made as such payments are based upon our receipt of cash for licensing and royalties 
we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases with initial terms exceeding one year 
rent expense in the years ended december   and was   and  respectively 
included in operating leases is a year port dock lease on the ohio river  we have the right to cancel this lease upon six months written notice  if we cancelled this lease as of december   we would be obligated to pay only  of the million included in the table 
purchase commitments include our  pound per hour circulating fluidized bed coal fired boiler island that is being constructed 
we have the right to cancel this at any time with a penalty  if we cancelled this as of december   we would be obligated to pay only million of the million included in the table 
consulting and service commitments include agreements with consultants to advise us on proposed legislation and regulations and advocate our interests before the us congress and regulatory agencies  these agreements are for months 
also included in consulting and service agreements is an agreement for technical and engineering service in which we have the right to cancel upon six months written notice  if we cancelled this agreement as of december   we would be obligated to pay only million of the million include in the table 
effective february   we amended and restated a service agreement with bechtel  as a result of this amendment  if we were to cancel early we would be required to pay up to a million termination fee 
historical view cash used in provided by operating activities cash used in operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the majority of the cash used in operating activities for the year ended december   relates to cash utilized in our on going operations  as adjusted for non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the most significant adjustment to net loss to arrive at cash used in operating activities for the year ended december   were non cash expense related to the adoption of sfas r and the issuance of stock and warrants for services resulting in a million charge and depreciation  depletion and amortization of million  primarily from the acquisition of buckeye 
the most significant adjustments to net loss for the year ended december  were non cash expense related to the issuance of warrants and options to employees  directors and consultants of million  and a million non cash charge to establish and an allowance for a note receivable 
cash used in operating activities was million and cash provided by operating activities was million for the years ended december  and  respectively

the majority of the uses of cash related to the following  we spent million and million on our fort union plant for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we had capital expenditures related to other purchases of property and equipment of  and  for and  respectively 
we were required to restricted cash to serve as collateral of million and million in and  respectively  to collateralize other contractual obligations and our asset retirement obligation 
cash provided by financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the same period ended  an increase of million 
the increase is attributable to the million of cash received from our public offering in february and an increase of million of cash proceeds from the exercise of warrants and options 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million compared to the same period ended the majority of our financing activities related to the exercise of options and warrants and the issuance of common stock in private placements

in addition  in  we generated cash from the issuance of common stock from private placements of million 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates below as critical to our current and future business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other significant accounting policies  see the notes to our consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
these policies and estimates are considered critical because they either had a material impact or they have the potential to have a material impact on our financial statements  and because they require significant judgments  assumptions or estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements in this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect both the results of operations as well as the carrying values of our assets and liabilities 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base estimates on historical experience and or on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  making it possible that a change in these estimates could occur in the near term 
set forth below is a summary of our most critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  generally when an agreement has been signed  all significant obligations have been satisfied  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
any up front fees received are deferred and recognized over the provision of specific deliverables as defined in the agreements 
as our history related to customer relationships is limited  we may be required to change the estimated period over which we recognize our revenue as more information becomes available 
arrangements that include multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine whether the elements are separable based on objective evidence 
if the elements are deemed separable  total consideration is allocated to each element and the revenue associated with each element is recognized as earned 
if the elements are not deemed separable  total consideration is deferred and recognized ratably over the longer of the contractual period or the expected customer relationship period 
we believe that the accounting estimates related to customer relationship periods and to the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable are critical accounting estimates because they require management to make assumptions about how long we will retain customers  for which we have limited history  the assessment of whether bundled elements are separable can be subjective  and the impact of changes in actual retention periods versus these estimates on the revenue amounts reported in our consolidated statements of operations could be material 
accounts and notes receivable and allowances 
receivables are recorded at their estimated net realizable value 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through an analysis of the past due status of receivables and assessments of risk regarding collectability 
if the financial condition of the customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
as of december   we had a million recorded allowance for doubtful accounts relating primarily to a note receivable 
capitalization of costs 
generally  we expense plant start up costs as incurred that do not extend the life of the plant or increase production volumes 
in addition  we expense mine exploration costs as incurred 
once it has been determined that it is economically feasible to extract coal  we begin to capitalize these costs as premining costs 
we have identified the commencement of permitting as the point to begin capitalizing premining costs 
judgment is exercised in determining i if costs extend the life of the plant  ii if costs increase plant production volumes  and iii the feasibility of extracting coal 
if these judgments are incorrect  we may capitalize more costs than we otherwise should 
mineral rights and mine development 
a significant portion of our coal reserves are controlled through leasing arrangements 
costs to obtain coal lands and leased mineral rights  including capitalized premining costs  are capitalized and depleted to operations using the units of production method based on tons produced utilizing only proven and recoverable reserves in the depletion base and are assumed to have no residual value 
premining costs include drilling  permitting  county and state filing fees and the initial overburden removal 
we used assumptions such as selling price of coal  costs to mine and a discount rate to value our mines at buckeye 
if the assumptions used to value the proven and recoverable reserves change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
useful lives of our long lived assets 
selecting the useful lives of long lived assets to be depreciated  depleted or amortized requires a significant amount of judgment 
we placed our fort union plant into service in the third quarter of as this is the first of its kind plant  assumptions were made in order to estimate the total expected production for the life of the plant 
these assumptions were primarily based upon research and inquiry of our engineers and out source engineers 
as there is no history on which to base the economic life of the equipment and as we used a number of assumptions and estimates in determining the production of the plant  we may periodically need to re evaluate the economic life of and production our fort union plant and may be required to take additional depreciation expense 
valuation of long lived assets 
the valuation of our long lived and intangible assets  including our fort union plant  mineral rights and patents  have significant impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
we must assess the realizable value of these assets for potential impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of these assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
the estimates and assumptions related to our fort union plant are particularly difficult to determine as it is a first of its kind facility 
in addition  we must make assumptions regarding the useful lives of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
asset retirement obligations 
we are required to record the fair value of legally required removal costs and retirement obligations as a liability and we also recorded an offsetting asset 
initially  our asset retirement obligations were recorded at their fair value using an expected cash flow approach  in which multiple cash flow scenarios that reflected the range of possible outcomes and a credit adjusted risk free rate were applied 
the liability is then accreted over time by applying the interest method of allocation 
in determining the initial liability  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors 
in addition  the rate of accretion is based upon our best estimate of the rate at which cost to complete the reclamation will increase 
if these estimates and their related assumptions are incorrect or change in the future  we may be required to increase our obligation 
accounting for stock grants  options and warrants 
we issue stock grants  options and warrants to employees  board of directors and consultants in connection with our various business activities 
in accounting for these awards we are required to make estimates of the fair value of the related instruments  the periods benefited and forfeiture rates 
these estimates may affect such financial statement categories as stockholders equity and general and administrative expense 
if these estimates are incorrect  we may be required to incur additional expense in the future 
accounting for acquisitions 
the acquisition of businesses is an important element of our strategy 
we are required to record the net assets acquired at the estimated fair value at the date of acquisition 
the determination of the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect our financial statements 
for example  the value and estimated life of assets may affect the amount of future period depletion and depreciation expense for the assets as well as possible impairment charges that may be incurred 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 fair value measurement 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the financial accounting standards board having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are in the process of evaluating the impacts  if any  of adopting this pronouncement 
in september  the us securities and exchange commission released staff accounting bulletin no 
 financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
expresses the staff s view regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
the interpretations in sab no 
are being issued to address diversity in practice in quantifying financial statement misstatements and the potential under current practice for the build up of improper amounts on the balance sheet 
sab no 
is effective for annual financial statements covering the first fiscal year ending after november  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position or results our operations 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that we recognize  in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of january  we are in the process of evaluating the impacts  if any  of adopting this pronouncement 
in may  the financial accounting standards board  as part of an effort to conform to international accounting standards  issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which was effective for us beginning on january  sfas no 
requires that all voluntary changes in accounting principles be retrospectively applied to prior financial statements as if that principle had always been used  unless it is impracticable to do so 
when it is impracticable to calculate the effects on all prior periods  sfas no 
requires that the new principle be applied to the earliest period practicable 
since adoption  sfas no 
has not had a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to risks inherent in operations  we are exposed to the following market risks in our business we are exposed to market risk due to changes in natural gas prices 
natural gas is used in our k fuel process at our fort union plant 
there has been a generally increasing trend in natural gas prices during the last few years due to various supply factors  including the increasing overall demand for natural gas from industrial users  which is affected  in part  by the general conditions of the united states economy  and other factors 
seasonal fluctuations exist each year resulting from various supply and demand factors  such as the severity of winters affecting consumer consumption for heating and the severity of  summers affecting industrial demand for electrical generation  among other factors 
a hypothetical increase of per mmbtu of natural gas prior to the installation of a reboiler and other plant modifications could increase the cost per ton by approximately per ton of k fuel or approximately million annually  assuming the plant is operating at near full design utilization 
some of the products used in our mining activities  such as diesel fuel and explosives  are subject to commodity price risk 
we expect to consume million to million gallons of fuel per year 
on a per gallon basis  based on this usage  a change in fuel prices of one cent per gallon would result in an increase in our operating costs of approximately  per year 
alternatively  a one dollar per barrel change in the price of crude oil would increase or decrease our annual fuel costs by approximately  we are indirectly exposed to fluctuations in fuel commodity prices 
to the extent that fuel prices rise or fall  there may be greater or lesser demand for our k fuel refined coal 
we own or hold no derivative instruments or floating rate debt and do not expect to derive a material amount of our revenues from such interest bearing securities 
currently  we have no significant foreign operations 
we were required to establish an irrevocable standby letter of credit in euros  which will be adjusted to account for the change in foreign currency rates 
as these adjustments are made we will either increase or decrease our restricted cash balance 
at this time we are still evaluating our exposure to these foreign currency rate adjustments 
however  to the extent that we establish significant foreign operations in the future  we may attempt to mitigate risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates contractually and through the use of hedging activities and other means considered appropriate 
we hold no equity market securities  which are subject to equity market risk relative to our own equity securities
