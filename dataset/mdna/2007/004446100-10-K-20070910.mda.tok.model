item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide the readers of our financial statements with a narrative discussion about our business 
the md a is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
we are reporting a  increase in operating profit to  for the year ended june  as compared to  for the prior year 
this increase in operating profit was achieved  despite a highly competitive environment  primarily through maintaining our profit margin and our successful management of selling  general and administrative costs 
net sales for fiscal were  an increase of  from fiscal this increase in net sales also impacted our gross profit  which increased  to  for fiscal our net income increased to  or per diluted share  an increase of or compared to fiscal year our financial position as of june   remains strong  as we had cash and short term investments of  working capital of  no long term debt and shareholders equity of  our business is separated into three principal segments health sciences  chemicals colorants and crop protection 
the health sciences segment is our largest segment in terms of both sales and gross profits 
products that fall within this segment include api s  pharmaceutical intermediates  nutritionals and biopharmaceuticals 
in fiscal  we entered the market for finished dosage form generic drugs when we received orders for our first aceto branded product  isoflurane 
we typically partner with both customers and suppliers years in advance of a drug coming off patent to provide the generic equivalent 
we believe we have a pipeline of new api s poised to reach commercial levels over the coming years as the patents on existing drugs expire  both in the united states and europe 
in addition  we continue to explore opportunities to provide a second source option for existing generic drugs with approved anda s 
the opportunities that we are looking for are to supply the api s for the more mature generic drugs where pricing has stabilized following the dramatic decreases in price that these drugs experienced after coming off patent 
as is the case in the generic industry  the entrance into the market of other generic competition generally has a negative impact on the pricing of the affected products 
by leveraging our worldwide sourcing and regulatory capabilities  we believe we can be an alternative lower cost  second source provider of existing api s to generic drug companies 
the chemicals colorants segment is a major supplier to the many different industries that require outstanding performance from chemical raw materials and additives 
products that fall within this segment include intermediates for dyes  pigments and agrochemicals 
we provide chemicals used to make plastics  surface coatings  textiles  lubricants  flavors and fragrances 
many of aceto s raw materials are also used in high tech products like high end electronic parts circuit boards and computer chips and binders for specialized rocket fuels 
aceto is currently responding to the changing needs of our customers in the color producing industry by taking our resources and knowledge downstream as a supplier of select organic pigments 
we expect that continued global gross domestic product growth will drive higher demand for the chemical industry  especially in china and other emerging regions of the world 
with supply growth limited  we expect that industry supply demand balances will remain favorable 
however  continued volatility in energy costs will add uncertainty to our profit outlook 
the crop protection segment sells herbicides  pesticides  and other agricultural chemicals to customers  primarily located in the united states and western europe 
our joint venture with nufarm  which markets butoxone r  increased our market share of the peanut  soybean and alfalfa herbicide markets 
in fiscal  we entered into a multi year contract with a major agricultural chemical distributor and launched generic asulam  an herbicide for sugar cane and the first generic registration that aceto has received 
our plan is to develop over time a pipeline of additional products in a similar manner 
the crop protection segment was formerly reported as the agrochemical segment with the name change effected on december  we formerly also reported under the institutional sanitary supplies segment  which included cleaning solutions  fragrances and deodorants for commercial and industrial customers 
this former segment was successfully divested from our ongoing business during fiscal our main business strengths are sourcing  regulatory support  quality control  marketing and distribution 
with a physical presence in ten countries  we distribute over  chemicals and pharmaceuticals used principally as raw materials in the pharmaceutical  agricultural  color  surface coating ink and general chemical consuming industries 
we believe that we are currently the largest buyer of pharmaceutical and specialty chemicals for export from china  purchasing from over different manufacturers 
in this md a  we explain our general financial condition and results of operations  including the following o factors that affect our business o our earnings and costs in the periods presented o changes in earnings and costs between periods o sources of earnings o the impact of these factors on our overall financial condition as you read this md a  refer to the accompanying consolidated statements of income  which present the results of our operations for the three years ended june  we analyze and explain the differences between periods in the specific line items of the consolidated statements of income 
critical accounting estimates and policies this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing these financial statements  we were required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we regularly evaluate our estimates including those related to allowances for bad debts  inventories  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  long lived assets  environmental and other contingencies  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on various factors  including historical experience  advice from outside subject matter experts  and various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  which together form the basis for our making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affected our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from sales of any product when it is shipped and title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
we have no acceptance or other post shipment obligations and we do not offer product warranties or services to our customers 
sales are recorded net of returns of damaged goods from customers  which historically have been immaterial  and sales incentives offered to customers 
sales incentives consist primarily of volume incentive rebates 
we record volume incentive rebates as the underlying revenue transactions that result in progress by the customer in earning the rebate are recorded  in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts relating to estimated losses resulting from customers being unable to make required payments 
allowances for doubtful accounts are based on historical experience and known factors regarding specific customers and the industries in which those customers operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their ability to make payments being impaired  additional allowances would be required 
inventories inventories  which consist principally of finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost first in first out method or market 
we write down our inventories for estimated excess and obsolete goods by an amount equal to the difference between the carrying cost of the inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a significant sudden increase in demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  we may overestimate or underestimate the demand for our products which would result in our understating or overstating  respectively  the write down required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and reported operating results 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
other indefinite lived intangible assets principally consist of trademarks 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment on at least an annual basis 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  we use many assumptions and estimates that directly impact the results of the testing 
in making these assumptions and estimates  we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
if our estimates or our related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
identifiable intangible assets principally consist of customer relationships  customer lists  epa registrations and related data  patent license and covenants not to compete 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
recoverability of assets held for sale is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the assets to their estimated fair value 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceed the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
environmental and other contingencies we establish accrued liabilities for environmental matters and other contingencies when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can reasonably be estimated 
if the contingency is resolved for an amount greater or less than the accrual  or our share of the contingency increases or decreases  or other assumptions relevant to the development of the estimate were to change  we would recognize an additional expense or benefit in income in the period that the determination was made 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach to financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we had current net deferred tax assets of  and non current net deferred tax assets of  these net deferred tax assets have been recorded based on our projecting that we will have sufficient future earnings to realize these assets  and the net deferred tax assets have been provided for at currently enacted income tax rates 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize a deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of net income at that time 
deferred taxes have not been provided on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries since substantially all of these earnings are expected to be permanently reinvested in our foreign operations 
a deferred tax liability will be recognized when we expect that we will recover those undistributed earnings in a taxable manner  such as through receipt of dividends or sale of the investments 
determination of the amount of the unrecognized us income tax liability is not practical because of the complexities of the hypothetical calculation 
in addition  unrecognized foreign tax credit carryforwards would be available to reduce a portion of such us tax liability 
tax reform has taken place in germany whereby an income tax law was passed in july  awaiting approval into the federal gazette 
the enacted tax rate in germany will potentially change from to 
as a result  the deferred tax balance could decrease by  in stock based compensation with the adoption of sfas no 
r on july   we are required to record the fair value of stock based compensation awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we apply the black scholes option pricing model  including an estimate of forfeitures 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option term  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that are based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option term assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
we use an expected stock price volatility assumption that is based on the historical daily price changes of the underlying stock which are obtained from public data sources 
for stock option grants issued during fiscal  we used an expected stock price volatility of based upon the historical volatility at the time of issuance 
with regard to the weighted average option term assumption  for stock option grants issued during fiscal  we used an expected option term assumption of years as determined under the simplified method prescribed in sec staff accounting bulletin sab no

prior to july  certain freight and storage costs were not able to be allocated to the segments 
effective july  as a result of certain system improvements  all freight and storage costs are allocated to a particular segment 
therefore  the unallocated portion of certain freight and storage costs for the year ended june  have now been identified to the segments as presented above 
total company gross profit and margin were not affected by this change in allocation of costs 
however  the comparison of gross profit by segment will be affected by the change in allocation of these costs 
net sales net sales increased  or  to  for the year ended june   compared with  for the prior year 
we reported sales increases in our health sciences and chemicals colorants segments  which were partially offset by a slight sales decrease in our crop protection segment 
health sciences net sales for the health sciences segment increased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a increase over net sales of  for the prior year 
the sales increase from the prior period is primarily related to increased sales from our foreign operations of  specifically our germany and singapore operations  and increased sales from the pharmaceutical intermediates and diagnostics products of  these increases were partially offset by a decrease from one specific generic product of  due to its normal selling pattern 
chemicals colorants net sales for the chemicals colorants segment were  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year 
this increase of  or  over the prior period is attributable to an increase in the number of products being offered by our foreign subsidiaries  namely germany and singapore 
sales of chemicals colorants by our foreign subsidiaries for the year ended june  increased by  over the comparable prior year period 
the increase in sales for this segment also resulted from the increase in sales in the coatings product group of  the increase in chemicals and colorant sales is partially offset by one customer within our color pigment and pigment intermediate business  whose contract expired in fiscal and purchased  during as compared to zero in our chemical business is diverse in terms of products  customers and consuming markets 
crop protection net sales for the crop protection segment decreased to  for the year ended june   a decrease of  or  over net sales of  for the prior year 
the overall decrease in net sales was mainly attributable to decreases in three products of  due to the unseasonable dry weather conditions  particularly in the southern us region and the reduction of peanut acreage in favor of corn due to the increased demand for ethanol 
these decreases were partially offset by the launch of our asulam product in the first quarter of which resulted in sales of  gross profit gross profit by segment increased  to  of net sales for the year ended june   as compared to  of net sales for the prior year 
the gross profit of each segment was negatively affected by the direct allocation of certain freight and storage costs in that had been reported as unallocated in prior years 
the company s overall gross profit and margin were not affected but the segmental comparisons to last year have been affected 
health sciences health sciences gross profit of  for the year ended june   was or higher than the prior year 
this increase in gross profit was directly attributable to the increase in the sales volume 
the gross margin declined to in fiscal compared to a gross margin of for the prior fiscal year which is directly attributed to the direct allocation of certain freight and storage charges that are not included in last year s comparable period 
chemicals colorants gross profit for the year ended june   decreased by  or  over the prior year due to the direct allocation of certain freight and storage charges not included in last year s comparable period as well as settlement of an anti dumping claim of gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the foreign subsidiaries  primarily germany and singapore  contributed or more gross profit in as compared to additionally  the coatings product group reported an increase of due to the sales increase previously mentioned above over the prior year 
crop protection gross profit for the crop protection segment increased to  for the year ended june   versus  for the prior year  an increase of or 
the primary reason for the increase in gross profit was due to the launch of the asulam product 
the gross profit was negatively affected by  related to the sales decline in the three products discussed earlier  which was partially offset by lower costs to maintain our epa registered products of unallocated freight and storage costs unallocated cost of sales was for fiscal compared to  in as a result of certain system improvements  certain freight and storage costs which were not able to be identified to a particular segment in the prior fiscal years  have now been included within the segments 
therefore  there are no unallocated freight and storage costs in the current year 
total company gross profit and margin were not affected by this allocation 
this revision will affect the comparison of the segments gross profits  however 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a decreased to for fiscal versus for fiscal the increase in sg a is primarily attributable to the increase of  in personnel costs including increased bonus expenses and additional employees  increase in sales and marketing expenses  and increased legal costs  partially offset by lower operating expenses of resulting from the sale of one of our subsidiaries in august and a charge for settlement of legal claims against one of our subsidiaries in operating income fiscal operating income was  compared to  in the prior year  an increase of  or 
this increase was due to the  increase in gross profit  which was partially offset by the overall increase in sg a expenses of interest and other income  net interest and other income was for fiscal  which represents a decrease from in fiscal the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease of in a government subsidy paid annually for doing business in a free trade zone in shanghai  china and net loss on foreign currency of  partially offset by an increase in interest income of due to increased investments during the year and increased interest rates

health sciences net sales for the health sciences segment decreased by  for the year ended june   to  which represents a decrease over net sales of  for the prior year 
the sales decrease from the prior period is directly attributable to the loss of foreign business of  from two previously launched apis due to increased competition 
the fiscal results  net of the two lost apis  include a sales reduction of  from our foreign operations which was partially offset by a sales increase of  from our domestic operations over the prior fiscal year 
chemicals colorants net sales for the chemicals colorants segment were  for the year ended june   compared to  for the prior year 
this increase of  or  over the prior period is primarily attributable to an increase in the agricultural intermediate  food  beverage and cosmetics and coatings product groups of  as compared to fiscal our chemical business is diverse in terms of products  customers and consuming markets 
one customer within our color pigment and pigment intermediate business purchased  less product during fiscal as their contract had expired 
this reduction was more than offset by an increase over the prior period in domestic sales of our diverse chemical and colorants offerings 
in addition  net sales include a  increase relating to our former cdc business  primarily from sales of the anti clog product we retained

this decrease in gross profit was directly attributable to the loss of business on two larger previously launched apis in asia of  due to significant competitive pressures as well as a decrease in our foreign business  net of the two apis  of this lost gross profit was partially offset by an increase in gross profit from sales increases from our domestic business of  over the prior fiscal year 
the gross margin increased to in fiscal compared to a gross margin of for the prior fiscal year due primarily to a shift in the product mix of net sales to higher margin products during the fiscal year 
chemicals colorants gross profit for the year ended june   decreased by  or  over the prior year 
gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal decreases in categories such as organic chemicals and chemical intermediates in terms of both volume and margins were the primary reasons for these decreases 
in addition  the decrease in gross margin percentage was partly attributable to an increased allocation of certain freight and storage costs 
crop protection gross profit for the crop protection segment decreased to  for the year ended june   versus  for the prior year  a decrease of  or 
gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the primary cause of the decrease was lower royalty payments from our foreign customers of and lower gross margins on our second highest volume product compared to the prior fiscal year of the gross profits and margins were also negatively affected by higher costs associated with maintaining our epa registered products and increased rebate expenses of unallocated freight and storage costs unallocated cost of sales decreased  to  in fiscal  compared to  in the prior year  representing a decrease 
the lower costs were mainly a result of decreased sales and shipments to customers 
in addition  certain system improvements allow previously unallocated costs to be identifiable and included in a particular segment 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a decreased  or  to  for the year ended june  compared to  for the prior year 
as a percentage of sales  sg a remained stable at for fiscal versus for fiscal the decrease in sg a was primarily due to a  decrease in expenses for our former cdc business  reduced legal fees of  a reduction in audit and sarbanes oxley compliance costs of and reduced sales and marketing related expenses of these expense reductions were partially offset by a charge for a settlement of legal claims against one of our subsidiaries

fifra requires that test data be provided to the epa to register  obtain and maintain approved labels for pesticide products 
the epa requires that follow on registrants of these products compensate the initial registrant for the cost of producing the necessary test data on a basis prescribed in the fifra regulations 
follow on registrants do not themselves generate or contract for the data 
however  when fifra requirements mandate that new test data be generated to enable all registrants to continue marketing a pesticide product  often both the initial and follow on registrants establish a task force to jointly undertake the testing effort 
we are presently a member of three such task force groups and historically  our payments have been in the range of per year 
we may be required to make additional payments in the future 
we  together with our subsidiaries  are subject to pending and threatened legal proceedings that have arisen in the normal course of business 
we do not know how the final resolution of these matters will affect our results of operations in a particular reporting period 
our management is of the opinion  however  that the ultimate outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect upon our financial condition or liquidity 
in march  arsynco received notice from the epa of its status as a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla for a site described as the berry s creek study area 
arsynco is one of over prp s which have potential liability for the required investigation and remediation of the site 
the estimate of the potential liability is not quantifiable for a number of reasons  including the difficulty in determining the extent of contamination and the length of time remediation may require 
in addition  any estimate of liability must also consider the number of other potentially responsible parties and their financial strength 
since an amount of the liability can not be reasonably estimated at this time  no accrual is recorded for these potential future costs 
the impact of the resolution of this matter on the company s results of operations in a particular reporting period is not known 
however  management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of this matter will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
related party transactions certain of our directors are affiliated with law firms that serve as our legal counsel on various corporate matters 
during fiscal years  and  we incurred legal fees of  and  respectively  for services rendered to the company by those law firms 
we believe that the fees charged by those firms were at rates comparable to rates obtainable from other firms for similar services

investment market price risk we had short term investments of  at june  those short term investments consisted of government and agency securities  corporate bonds and corporate equity securities  and they were recorded at fair value and had exposure to price risk 
if this risk is estimated as the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in prices quoted by stock exchanges  the effect of that risk would be as of june  actual results may differ 
foreign currency exchange risk in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  we hedge some of our transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies applicable to each of our various entities 
the instruments used for hedging are short term foreign currency contracts futures 
the changes in market value of such contracts have a high correlation to price changes in the currency of the related hedged transactions 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts outstanding that had a notional amount of  the difference between the fair market value of the foreign currency contracts and the related commitments at inception and the fair market value of the contracts and the related commitments at june   was not material 
in addition  we enter into cross currency interest rate swaps to reduce foreign currency exposure on inter company transactions 
in june we entered into a one year cross currency interest rate swap transaction  which expired in june when the underlying inter company loan was repaid  and in may we entered into a five year cross currency interest rate swap transaction  both for the purpose of hedging fixed interest rate  foreign currency denominated cash flows under inter company loans 
under the terms of these derivative financial instruments  us dollar fixed principal and interest payments to be received under inter company loans will be swapped for euro denominated fixed principal and interest payments 
the change in fair value of the swaps from date of purchase to june   was 
the gains or losses on the inter company loans due to changes in foreign currency rates will be offset by the gains or losses on the swap in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
since our interest rate swaps qualify as hedging activities  the change in their fair value  amounting to and in fiscal and  respectively  is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates for our subsidiaries that use a foreign currency as their functional currency and are translated into us dollars 
these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
on june   we had translation exposure to various foreign currencies  with the most significant being the euro and the chinese renminbi 
the potential loss as of june   resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates amounted to  actual results may differ 
interest rate risk due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our financial instrument holdings at year end were analyzed to determine their sensitivity to interest rate changes 
in this sensitivity analysis  we used the same change in interest rate for all maturities 
all other factors were held constant 
if there were an adverse change in interest rates of  the expected effect on net income related to our financial instruments would be immaterial 
however  there can be no assurances that interest rates will not significantly affect our results of operations
