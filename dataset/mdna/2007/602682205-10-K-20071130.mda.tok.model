item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we design  develop and sell semiconductor networking solutions for communications applications in enterprise  access  metropolitan and wide area networks 
our products  ranging from optical network transceiver solutions to voice and internet protocol ip processors  are classified into three focused product families high performance analog products  multiservice access digital signal processor dsp products and wide area networking wan communications products 
our products are sold to original equipment manufacturers oems for use in a variety of network infrastructure equipment  including mixed media gateways  high speed routers  switches  access multiplexers  cross connect systems  add drop multiplexers  digital loop carrier equipment  ip private branch exchanges pbxs and optical modules 
service providers use this equipment for the processing  transmission and switching of high speed voice  data and video traffic  including advanced services such as voice over ip voip  within different segments of the communications network 
our oem customers include alcatel lucent  cisco systems  inc  huawei technologies co  ltd  lm ericsson telephone company  nortel networks  inc  nokia siemens networks and zhongxing telecom equipment corp 
zte 
trends and factors affecting our business our products are components of network infrastructure equipment 
as a result  we rely on network infrastructure oems to select our products from among alternative offerings to be designed into their equipment 
these design wins are an integral part of the long sales cycle for our products 
our customers may need six months or longer to test and evaluate our products and an additional six months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our products 
we believe our close relationships with leading network infrastructure oems facilitate early adoption of our products during development of their products  enhance our ability to obtain design wins and encourage adoption of our technology by the industry 
we market and sell our semiconductor products directly to network infrastructure oems 
we also sell our products indirectly through electronic component distributors and third party electronic manufacturing service providers  who manufacture products incorporating our semiconductor networking solutions for oems 
sales to distributors accounted for approximately of our revenues for fiscal sales to customers located outside the united states  primarily in the asia pacific region and europe  were approximately of our net revenues for fiscal we believe a substantial portion of the products we sell to oems and third party manufacturing service providers in the asia pacific region is ultimately shipped to end markets in the americas and europe 
we have significant research  development  engineering and product design capabilities 
our success depends to a substantial degree upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely fashion new products and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
we have made  and plan to make  substantial investments in research and development and to participate in the formulation of industry standards 
we spent approximately million on research and development for fiscal we seek to maximize our return on our research and development spending by focusing our research and development investment in what we believe are key high growth markets  including voip and high performance analog applications 
we have developed and maintain a broad intellectual property portfolio  and we intend to periodically enter into strategic arrangements to leverage our portfolio by licensing or selling our patents or other intellectual property that are no longer core to our business 
we recognized our first revenues from the sale of patents during the fourth quarter of fiscal we are dependent upon third parties for the manufacture  assembly and testing of our products 
our ability to bring new products to market  to fulfill orders and to achieve long term revenue growth is dependent on our ability to obtain sufficient external manufacturing capacity  including wafer fabrication capacity 
periods of upturn in the semiconductor industry may be characterized by rapid increases in demand and a shortage of capacity for wafer fabrication and assembly and test services 
in such periods  we may experience longer lead times or indeterminate delivery schedules  which may adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders for our products 
during periods of capacity shortages for manufacturing  assembly and testing services  our primary foundries and other suppliers may devote their limited capacity to fulfill the requirements of other clients that are larger than we are  or who have superior contractual rights to enforce manufacture of their products  including to the exclusion of producing our products 
we may also incur increased manufacturing costs  including costs of finding acceptable alternative foundries or assembly and test service providers 
in order to achieve profitability  we must reduce operating expenses or achieve substantial revenue growth 
through fiscal  we have completed a series of cost reduction actions which have improved our operating cost structure 
our ability to achieve the necessary revenue growth will depend on increased demand for network infrastructure equipment that incorporates our products  which in turn depends primarily on the level of capital spending by communications service providers 
we believe the market for network infrastructure equipment in general  and for communications semiconductors in particular  offers attractive long term growth prospects due to increasing demand for network capacity  the continued upgrading and expansion of existing networks and the build out of telecommunication networks in developing countries 
however  the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and is characterized by constant and rapid technological change  rapid product obsolescence and price erosion  evolving technical standards  short product life cycles and wide fluctuations in product supply and demand 
in addition  there has been an increasing trend toward industry consolidation  particularly among major network equipment and telecommunications companies 
consolidation in the industry may lead to pricing pressure and loss of market share 
these factors have caused substantial fluctuations in our revenues and our results of operations in the past  and we may experience cyclical fluctuations in our business in the future 
on september   we acquired the product portfolio and intellectual property assets of ample communications  inc  an innovative developer of ethernet media access controller mac products for carrier ethernet aggregation applications 
we paid approximately million in cash to acquire the assets in a private foreclosure sale from ample s senior creditor 
ample s products ship to major oem equipment customers for installation in ethernet metropolitan  access  and enterprise networks  including wireless cellular backhaul and ethernet over sonet applications 
we intend to market  sell and support these ethernet aggregation products with densities ranging from two to ports and ethernet transmission speeds from mbps to gbps 
we also expect to develop and further extend the ethernet mac product line 
stock based compensation programs we use stock based compensation to attract and retain employees and to provide long term incentive compensation that aligns the interests of our employees with those of our stockholders 
prior to fiscal  our stock based compensation consisted principally of stock options 
eligible employees received grants of stock options at the time of hire  we also made broad based stock option grants covering substantially all of our employees annually 
stock option awards have exercise prices not less than the market price of our common stock at the grant date and a contractual term of eight or ten years  and are subject to time based vesting generally over four years 
from time to time we have also used restricted stock awards with time based vesting for incentive or retention purposes 
beginning in fiscal  we revised our stock based compensation arrangements to provide current and long term incentive compensation  principally through restricted stock awards 
during fiscal and fiscal  we granted an aggregate of million shares and million shares  respectively  of restricted stock to our employees 
these awards principally consisted of broad based grants  covering substantially all of our employees 
one broad based grant was intended to provide performance emphasis and incentive compensation through vesting tied to each employee s performance against individual goals for each of the fiscal years 
another broad based grant of restricted stock was intended to provide long term incentive compensation  these awards vest ratably over a period of four years  and require continued service 
in fiscal  certain senior management personnel also received additional restricted stock awards having vesting tied to our achievement of an operating profit 
from time to time  we also grant stock options or other stock based awards for incentive or retention purposes 
we periodically review  and may further revise  our compensation arrangements based on our assessment of the effectiveness of our compensation arrangements and to keep our overall compensation package at market levels 
effective october   we adopted financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment using the modified prospective application 
sfas r requires that we account for all stock based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the service period 
as required by sfas r  our stock based compensation expense for fiscal and fiscal includes the fair value of new awards  modified awards and any unvested awards outstanding at october  however  the consolidated financial statements for periods prior to the adoption of sfas r have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based upon the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards  as of the grant date  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the fair value of each award is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting or service period 
stock based compensation expense totaling million  million and  for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  is included in cost of goods sold  research and development expenses  selling  general and administrative expenses and special charges 
the increase principally reflects the cost of restricted stock and other awards made during fiscal and fiscal  as well as the cost of awards outstanding at october  but vesting after that date 
as of september   there was unrecognized compensation expense of million related to unvested stock options  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years and unrecognized compensation expense of million related to unvested restricted stock awards  which we expect to recognize over a weighted average period of years 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
among the significant estimates affecting our consolidated financial statements are those relating to inventories  revenue recognition  allowances for doubtful accounts  stock based compensation  income taxes and impairment of long lived assets 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
to the extent actual results differ from those estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our estimates  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in the event we experience unanticipated demand and are able to sell a portion of the inventories we have previously written down  our gross margins will be favorably affected 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r requires that we account for all stock based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the service period 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based upon the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards  as of the grant date  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes model requires that we make a number of estimates  including the expected option term  the expected volatility in the price of our common stock  the risk free rate of interest and the dividend yield on our common stock 
if our expected option term and stock price volatility assumptions were different  the resulting determination of the fair value of stock option awards could be materially different 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest upon the fulfillment of service conditions such as time based vesting or the achievement of specific performance conditions 
if the actual number of awards that ultimately vest differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues when the following fundamental criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii our price to the customer is fixed or determinable  and iv collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
delivery occurs when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  in accordance with the terms specified in the arrangement with the customer 
revenue recognition is deferred in all instances where the earnings process is incomplete 
we make certain product sales to electronic component distributors under agreements allowing for a right to return unsold products 
we defer the recognition of revenue on all sales to these distributors until the products are sold by the distributors to a third party 
we record a reserve for estimated sales returns and allowances in the same period as the related revenues are recognized 
we base these estimates on our historical experience or the specific identification of an event necessitating a reserve 
to the extent actual sales returns differ from our estimates  our future results of operations may be affected 
development revenue is recognized when services are performed and was not significant for any of the periods presented 
revenues from the sale of intellectual property is recognized when the above mentioned four criteria are met and was not significant for any of the periods presented 
deferred income taxes we have provided a full valuation allowance against our u 
s federal and state deferred tax assets 
if sufficient evidence of our ability to generate future u 
s federal and or state taxable income becomes apparent  we may be required to reduce our valuation allowance  resulting in income tax benefits in our statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the need for a valuation allowance quarterly 
impairment of long lived assets we continually monitor and review long lived assets  including fixed assets  goodwill and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of an asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
our estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  technological changes  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in our operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this pronouncement recommends a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the company s tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
the accounting provisions of fin will be effective for our first fiscal quarter of fiscal we are in the process of evaluating the effect  if any  the adoption of fin will have on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurement  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
we will be required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
the statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are currently not required to be measured at fair value 
we will be required to adopt sfas in the first quarter of fiscal and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb ratified emerging issues task force consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for non refundable advanced payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf issue no 
requires that these payments be deferred and capitalized and expensed as goods are delivered or as the related services are performed 
we will be required to adopt eitf in the first quarter of fiscal and do not expect that the adoption will have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
results of operations fourth quarter fiscal compared to fourth quarter fiscal in the fourth quarter of fiscal  our net revenues grew year over year  reaching million 
our fiscal fourth quarter net revenues increased approximately from fiscal third quarter net revenues of million 
over the past year we have been reviewing our portfolio of intellectual property with a view to license some of our key patents 
in addition  we have been considering the sale of certain patents that are no longer core to our business 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized our first revenues from these efforts 
our operating loss for the fiscal fourth quarter was  compared to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the decrease in our operating loss reflects a higher gross margin of million and decreased operating expenses of million mainly due to cost cutting measures implemented beginning in the first quarter of fiscal net revenues fiscal compared to fiscal  fiscal compared to fiscal the following table summarizes our net revenues change change dollars in millions multiservice access dsp products high performance analog products wan communications products net revenues the decrease in our net revenues for fiscal compared to fiscal reflects lower sales volumes across each of our product families 
net revenues from our multiservice access dsp products decreased million  or  reflecting a decrease in sales in our legacy products mostly offset by increased sales volumes across our newer voip product families as well as revenues recorded on the sale of intellectual property 
we are experiencing increased sales volumes of our newer voip product families as telecommunication service providers install equipment to transmit their voice traffic over ip data networks 
we believe we are benefiting from the increasing deployment of ip based networks both in new network buildouts particularly in asia and the replacement of circuit switched networks 
net revenues from our high performance analog products decreased by million  or  mostly due to decreased shipments of our physical media dependent devices serving fiber optic markets somewhat offset by increased shipments of video infrastructure products serving standard and high definition broadcast video markets 
sales of our wan communications products decreased by million  or  primarily resulting from a slowdown in consumption of our products in access and metropolitan area network applications such as t e carrier transmission products 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in demand for our atm mpls network processor products for use in wireless  enterprise and broadband infrastructure applications 
for fiscal  the increase in our net revenues compared to fiscal reflects higher sales volumes across each of our product families 
net revenues from our multiservice access dsp products increased million  or  reflecting increased sales volumes across the majority of our voip product families 
net revenues from our high performance analog products increased by million  or  benefiting from increased shipments of our crosspoint switches  physical media dependent devices serving fiber optic markets and video infrastructure products serving standard and high definition broadcast video markets 
sales of our wan communications products increased by million  or  reflecting increased shipments of our t e carrier transmission products serving metro access and aggregation as well as wireless markets  partially offset by lower demand for our atm mpls network processor products serving router markets 
gross margin change change dollars in millions gross margin percent of net revenues gross margin represents net revenues less cost of goods sold 
as a fabless semiconductor company  we use third parties including tsmc  jazz and amkor for wafer fabrication and assembly and test services 
our cost of goods sold consists predominantly of purchased finished wafers  assembly and test services  royalty and other intellectual property costs  labor and overhead costs associated with product procurement  and sustaining engineering expenses pertaining to products sold 
our gross margin for fiscal decreased million over fiscal  principally reflecting the decrease in our net revenues 
our gross margin as a percent of net revenues for fiscal decreased from fiscal primarily as a result of a million reduction in the benefit related to the sale of inventory previously written down to a zero cost basis in in addition  the change in provision for excess and obsolete inventories was an increase in the provision of million in fiscal compared to a net decrease of  for fiscal our gross margin for fiscal increased million over fiscal  principally reflecting the increase in our net revenues in fiscal and the favorable effect of increased manufacturing volumes  net favorable impact of higher than anticipated manufacturing yields  a net decrease in the provision for excess and obsolete inventories  partially offset by a greater level of depreciation on photomask production tooling and a higher level of variable manufacturing overhead 
our gross margin as a percent of net revenues for fiscal declined from fiscal primarily as a result of a reduction in the benefit related to the sale of inventory previously written down to a zero cost basis in the change in provision for excess and obsolete inventories was a decrease of  for fiscal  compared to an increase in the provision of  for fiscal our gross margins also benefited from the sale of inventories with an original cost of million  million and million that we had written down to a zero cost basis during fiscal these sales resulted from renewed demand for certain products that was not anticipated at the time of the write downs 
the previously written down inventories were generally sold at prices which exceeded their original cost 
in fiscal  we recorded an aggregate of million of inventory write downs  reducing the cost basis of the affected inventories to zero 
the fiscal inventory write downs resulted from the sharply reduced end customer demand for network infrastructure equipment during that period 
as a result of these market conditions  we experienced a significant number of order cancellations and a decline in the volume of new orders beginning in the fiscal first quarter 
the inventories written down in fiscal principally consisted of multiservice access processors and dsl transceivers 
we assess the recoverability of our inventories at least quarterly through a review of inventory levels in relation to foreseeable demand generally over twelve months 
foreseeable demand is based upon all available information  including sales backlog and forecasts  product marketing plans and product life cycles 
when the inventory on hand exceeds the foreseeable demand  we write down the value of those inventories which  at the time of our review  we expect to be unable to sell 
the amount of the inventory write down is the excess of historical cost over estimated realizable value 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
our products are used by oems that have designed our products into network infrastructure equipment 
for many of our products  we gain these design wins through a lengthy sales cycle  which often includes providing technical support to the oem customer 
in the event of the loss of business from existing oem customers  we may be unable to secure new customers for our existing products without first achieving new design wins 
when the quantities of inventory on hand exceed foreseeable demand from existing oem customers into whose products our products have been designed  we generally will be unable to sell our excess inventories to others  and the estimated realizable value of such inventories to us is generally zero 
from the time of the fiscal inventory write downs through september   we scrapped a portion of these inventories having an original cost of million and sold a portion of these inventories with an original cost of million 
the sales resulted from increased demand beginning in the first quarter of fiscal which was not anticipated at the time of the write downs 
as of september   we continued to hold inventories with an original cost of million which were previously written down to a zero cost basis 
we currently intend to hold these remaining inventories and will sell these inventories if we continue to experience a renewed demand for these products 
while there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so  if we are able to sell a portion of the inventories which are carried at zero cost basis  our gross margins will be favorably affected by an amount equal to the original cost of the zero cost basis inventory sold 
to the extent that we do not experience renewed demand for the remaining inventories  they will be scrapped as they become obsolete 
we base our assessment of the recoverability of our inventories  and the amounts of any write downs  on currently available information and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
demand for our products may fluctuate significantly over time  and actual demand and market conditions may be more or less favorable than those projected by management 
in the event that actual demand is lower than originally projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
research and development change change dollars in millions research and development expenses percent of net revenues our research and development r d expenses consist principally of direct personnel costs  photomasks  electronic design automation tools and pre production evaluation and test costs 
the million decrease in r d expenses from fiscal to fiscal principally reflects a million decrease in compensation and personnel related costs and a million decrease in the cost of our facilities resulting from our expense reduction actions 
the decrease in r d expenses also reflects a million decrease in depreciation expense  principally resulting from certain assets reaching the end of their depreciable lives  and a million decrease in the cost of materials  photomasks and preproduction devices 
the decrease in r d expenses fiscal compared to fiscal includes a million decrease in compensation and personnel related costs  partly attributable to a one time vacation requirement  a million decrease in depreciation expense and a million decrease in materials  supplies and mask sets  principally resulting from the expense reduction actions we completed in fiscal during fiscal  we reduced our workforce and closed design centers in herzlia  israel and lisle  illinois 
the affected research and development programs were principally our asynchronous transfer mode atm multi protocol label switching mpls network processor products and  to a lesser extent  our t e carrier transmission products 
these personnel related cost savings were partly offset by increased headcount and spending directed toward voip products and our high performance analog products  and by a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
the decrease in r d expenses in fiscal also reflects lower costs for materials  photomasks and preproduction devices resulting from the aforementioned expense reduction actions and the reduction in new product development activities in the atm mpls and t e carrier transmission product lines 
selling  general and administrative change change dollars in millions selling  general and administrative expenses percent of net revenues our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses include personnel costs  independent sales representative commissions and product marketing  applications engineering and other marketing costs 
our sg a expenses also include costs of corporate functions including accounting  finance  legal  human resources  information systems and communications 
the million decrease in our sg a expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal reflects a million decrease in personnel related costs and a million decrease in the cost of our facilities  all of which are a result of our expense reduction actions 
in addition  insurance costs decreased million and commissions expense decreased million as a result of a reduction in the usage of outside sales representatives 
the increase in our sg a expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal principally reflects a million increase in stock based compensation expense  partially offset by the benefit of a one time vacation requirement 
the increase also reflects increased compensation and personnel related costs and higher sales commissions associated with the increase in sales for fiscal compared to fiscal amortization of intangible assets and change in accounting for goodwill dollars in millions amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased to zero beginning in fiscal because the remainder of our intangible assets became fully amortized during fiscal  reducing their carrying value to zero 
intangible assets were amortized over periods averaging approximately five years for each major asset class and extending to various dates through june in conjunction with the acquisition of certain assets of ample communications  inc which occurred at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  we have recorded intangible assets over periods ranging from three months to ten years that will be amortized beginning in fiscal special charges special charges consist of the following in millions asset impairments restructuring charges asset impairments during fiscal  we recorded asset impairment charges totaling  related to property and equipment that we determined to abandon or scrap  including assets associated with the closure of our former design centers in herzlia  israel and lisle  illinois 
we continually monitor and review long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  for possible impairment 
future impairment tests may result in significant write downs of the value of our assets 
restructuring charges mindspeed restructuring plan during the first and second quarters of fiscal  we implemented a restructuring plan under which we reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
the affected employees included approximately persons in research and development  in sales and marketing and in general and administrative functions 
in connection with this reduction in workforce  we recorded a charge of million for severance benefits payable to the affected employees and  for the value of stock based compensation awards that will vest without future service to us 
on december   we vacated approximately  square feet of excess space at our newport beach headquarters and recorded a charge related to contractual obligations on this space of approximately million 
this charge was increased by million during the second fiscal quarter of and an additional million in the fourth fiscal quarter of as a result of a change in sub lease income estimates 
we expect to incur a total of million of additional restructuring costs in future periods related to this plan 
activity and liability balances related to the mindspeed restructuring plan through september  are as follows in thousands workforce reductions facility and other total charged to costs and expenses    cash payments    reversal of non cash charges restructuring balance  september    mindspeed restructuring plan in march  we implemented a restructuring plan under which we reduced our workforce by approximately employees 
the affected employees included approximately persons in research and development  in sales and marketing and in general and administrative functions 
in july  we continued this restructuring plan and reduced our workforce by an additional employees 
the affected employees included approximately persons in research and development and in sales and marketing 
in connection with the restructuring plan  we recorded million of restructuring charges for fiscal these restructuring charges included million of severance benefits payable to employees and  for the value of stock based compensation awards that vest without future service to us 
activity and liability balances related to the mindspeed restructuring plan through september  are as follows in thousands workforce reductions charged to costs and expenses  cash payments  reversal of non cash charges restructuring balance  september  reversal of previously accrued costs and expenses cash payments non cash charges restructuring balance  september  other restructuring plans in fiscal  and  we implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives to improve our operating cost structure 
the cost reduction initiatives included workforce reductions  significant reductions in capital spending  the consolidation of certain facilities and salary reductions for the senior management team 
during the year ended september   we made cash payments of  under these restructuring plans and reversed  of previously accrued costs and expenses related to a facility closure 
as of september   there were no remaining liabilities under these restructuring plans 
as of september   we have a remaining accrued restructuring balance for all restructuring plans totaling million principally representing obligations under non cancelable leases  employee severance benefits and other contractual commitments 
we expect to pay these obligations over their respective terms  which expire at various dates through fiscal the payments will be funded from available cash balances and funds from product sales and are not expected to significantly impact liquidity 
interest expense in millions interest expense interest expense for fiscal  and represents interest on the million convertible senior notes we issued in december interest expense increased for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  because the notes were outstanding during the entire fiscal year 
other income  net in millions other income  net other income principally consists of interest income  foreign exchange gains and losses  franchise taxes and other non operating gains and losses 
the decrease in other income in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally reflects lower interest income resulting from the lower cash  cash equivalent and marketable security balances 
the decrease in other income in fiscal as compared to fiscal principally reflects lower interest income resulting from the lower cash  cash equivalent and marketable security balances partially offset by higher interest rates that prevailed during fiscal provision for income taxes in millions provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes for fiscal years  and principally consisted of income taxes incurred by our foreign subsidiaries 
as a result of our recent operating losses and our expectation of future operating results  we determined that it is more likely than not that the us federal and state income tax benefits principally net operating losses we can carry forward to future years which arose during fiscal   and will not be realized 
accordingly  we have not recognized any income tax benefits relating to our us federal and state operating losses for those periods and we do not expect to recognize any income tax benefits relating to future operating losses until we believe that such tax benefits are more likely than not to be realized 
we expect that our provision for income taxes for fiscal will principally consist of income taxes related to our foreign operations 
as of september   we had a valuation allowance of million against our us federal and state deferred tax assets which reduces their carrying value to zero because we do not expect to realize these deferred tax assets through the reduction of future income tax payments 
as of september   we had us federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  including the net operating loss carryforwards we retained in the distribution 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents our operating results for each of the eight fiscal quarters in the period ended september  the information for each of these quarters is derived from our unaudited interim financial statements which have been prepared on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
in our opinion  all necessary adjustments  which consist only of normal and recurring accruals as well as the inventory write downs and special charges  have been included to fairly present our unaudited quarterly results

in addition  in the second and third quarters of fiscal we believe we experienced a build up of inventory at our customers that resulted in lower shipments in the fourth quarter of fiscal and into fiscal by the third quarter of fiscal  both the consolidations at our customers and build up of inventory in the channel were substantially remedied 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recognized our first revenues from the sale of a patent 
the changes in our quarterly gross margin for fiscal and generally reflect the changes in sales volume experienced in each respective quarter 
our quarterly r d expenses generally decreased through fiscal and as a result of the workforce reductions and other cost reduction initiatives we have implemented 
in fiscal and fiscal  we recorded special charges for our restructuring plans 
interest expense for fiscal and fiscal represents interest on the million convertible senior notes we issued in december other income decreased during fiscal as a result of lower invested cash balances 
in the past  our quarterly operating results have fluctuated due to a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
these include changes in the overall demand for network infrastructure equipment  the timing of new product introductions  the timing of receipt  reduction or cancellation of significant orders by customers  supply availability and other factors that have had a significant impact on our revenues and gross margins 
significant quarterly fluctuations in results of operations have also caused significant fluctuations in our liquidity and working capital  including our cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and payable and inventories 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal operating cash flows for fiscal reflect our net loss of million  partially offset by non cash charges depreciation  stock compensation  inventory provisions and other of million  and net working capital increases of approximately million 
the net working capital increases for fiscal included a million decrease in accounts payable and a million decrease in accrued expenses and other current liabilities mainly due to the timing of vendor payments 
these amounts were partially offset by a million decrease in net inventories resulting from our efforts to reduce inventory on hand and a million decrease in accounts receivable resulting from a decrease in our average collection period 
cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal consisted of net sales of marketable securities net of purchases of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million and the acquisition of assets from ample communications of million 
cash provided by investing activities of million for fiscal principally consisted of net sales of marketable securities net of purchases of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million

cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal consisted of proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal consisted of net proceeds of million from the sale of million principal amount of convertible senior notes and proceeds of million from the exercise of stock options and warrants  partially offset by debt issuance costs of  convertible senior notes offering in december  we sold million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due for net proceeds after discounts and commissions of approximately million 
the notes are senior unsecured obligations  ranking equal in right of payment with all future unsecured indebtedness 
the notes bear interest at a rate of  payable semiannually in arrears each may and november we used approximately million of the proceeds to purchase us government securities that were pledged to the trustee for the payment of the first four scheduled interest payments on the notes when due 
the notes are convertible  at the option of the holder  at any time prior to maturity into shares of our common stock 
upon conversion  we may  at our option  elect to deliver cash in lieu of shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
effective may   the conversion price of the notes was adjusted to per share of common stock  which is equal to a conversion rate of approximately shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
prior to this adjustment  the conversion price applicable to the notes was per share of common stock  which was equal to approximately shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes 
the adjustment was made pursuant to the terms of the indenture governing the notes 
the conversion price is subject to further adjustment under the terms of the indenture to reflect stock dividends  stock splits  issuances of rights to purchase shares of common stock and certain other events 
if we undergo certain fundamental changes as defined in the indenture  holders of notes may require us to repurchase some or all of their notes at of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest 
if  upon notice of certain events constituting a fundamental change  holders of the notes elect to convert the notes  we will be required to increase the number of shares issuable upon conversion by up to shares per  principal amount of notes 
the number of additional shares  if any  will be determined by the table set forth in the indenture governing the notes 
in the event of a non stock change of control constituting a public acquirer change of control as defined in the indenture  we may  in lieu of issuing additional shares or making an additional cash payment upon conversion as required by the indenture  elect to adjust the conversion price and the related conversion obligation such that the noteholders will be entitled to convert their notes into a number of shares of public acquirer common stock 
for financial accounting purposes  our contingent obligation to issue additional shares or make additional cash payment upon conversion following a fundamental change is an embedded derivative 
as of september   the estimated fair value of our liability under the fundamental change adjustment was not significant 
conexant warrant in the distribution  we issued to conexant a warrant to purchase million shares of our common stock at a price of per share  exercisable for a period of ten years after the distribution 
the warrant contains antidilution provisions that provide for adjustment of the exercise price  and the number of shares issuable under the warrant  upon the occurrence of certain events 
if we issue  or are deemed to have issued  shares of our common stock  or securities convertible into our common stock  at prices below the current market price of our common stock as defined in the warrants at the time of the issuance of such securities  the warrant s exercise price will be reduced and the number of shares issuable under the warrant will be increased 
the amount of such adjustment  if any  will be determined pursuant to a formula specified in the warrant and will depend on the number of shares issued  the offering price and the current market price of our common stock at the time of the issuance of such securities 
adjustments to the warrant pursuant to these antidilution provisions may result in significant dilution to the interests of our existing stockholders and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the antidilution provisions may also limit our ability to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us 
moreover  we may not realize any cash proceeds from the exercise of the warrant held by conexant 
a holder of the warrant may opt for a cashless exercise of all or part of the warrant 
in a cashless exercise  the holder of the warrant would make no cash payment to us and would receive a number of shares of our common stock having an aggregate value equal to the excess of the then current market price of the shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant over the exercise price of the warrant 
such an issuance of common stock would be immediately dilutive to the interests of other stockholders 
liquidity our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash balances  marketable securities and cash generated from product sales 
as of september   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
our working capital at september  was million 
in order to become profitable  or to generate positive cash flows from operations  we must further reduce operating expenses and or increase revenues 
through fiscal  we have completed a series of cost reduction actions which have improved our operating cost structure 
these expense reductions alone may not make us profitable or allow us to sustain profitability if it is achieved 
our ability to achieve the necessary revenue growth will depend on increased demand for network infrastructure equipment that incorporates our products  which in turn depends primarily on the level of capital spending by communications service providers and enterprises 
we may not be successful in achieving the necessary revenue growth or we may be unable to sustain past and future expense reductions in subsequent periods 
we may not achieve profitability or sustain such profitability  if achieved 
we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  along with cash expected to be generated from product sales  will be sufficient to fund our operations  research and development efforts  anticipated capital expenditures  working capital and other financing requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we will need to continue a focused program of capital expenditures to meet our research and development and corporate requirements 
we may also consider acquisition opportunities to extend our technology portfolio and design expertise and to expand our product offerings 
in order to fund capital expenditures  increase our working capital or complete any acquisitions  we may seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing 
we may also need to seek to obtain additional debt or equity financing if we experience downturns or cyclical fluctuations in our business that are more severe or longer than anticipated or if we fail to achieve anticipated revenue and expense levels 
however  we cannot assure you that such financing will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the future payments we are required to make under contractual obligations as of september  payments due by period contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt interest expense on long term debt operating leases purchase obligations total long term debt consists of million aggregate principal amount of our convertible senior notes 
the notes bear interest at a rate of  payable semiannually in arrears each may and november  and mature on november  in june  we extended our sublease with conexant pursuant to which we lease our headquarters in newport beach  california 
the sublease  which had been amended and restated in march  had an initial term through june the sublease was extended for an additional two year term through june for a reduced amount of space 
rent payable under the sublease for the next months is approximately million and will be reduced to approximately million annually thereafter resulting from the space reduction 
rent payable is subject to annual increases of  plus a prorated portion of operating expenses associated with the leased property 
we estimate our minimum future obligation under the sublease at approximately million over the remainder of the lease term  but actual costs under the sublease will vary based upon conexant s actual costs 
in addition  each year we may elect to purchase certain services from conexant based on a prorated portion of conexant s actual costs 
we lease our other facilities and certain equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
the leases expire at various dates through and contain various provisions for rental adjustments  including  in certain cases  adjustments based on increases in the consumer price index 
the leases generally contain renewal provisions for varying periods of time 
although we have entered into non cancelable subleases with anticipated rental income totaling million and extending to various dates through fiscal  we have not reduced the amount of our contractual obligations under the related operating leases to take into account the anticipated rental income 
off balance sheet arrangements we have made guarantees and indemnities  under which we may be required to make payments to a guaranteed or indemnified party  in relation to certain transactions 
in connection with the distribution  we generally assumed responsibility for all contingent liabilities and then current and future litigation against conexant or its subsidiaries related to the mindspeed business 
we may also be responsible for certain federal income tax liabilities under the tax allocation agreement between us and conexant  which provides that we will be responsible for certain taxes imposed on us  conexant or conexant stockholders 
in connection with certain facility leases  we have indemnified our lessors for certain claims arising from the facility or the lease 
we indemnify our directors  officers  employees and agents to the maximum extent permitted under the laws of the state of delaware 
the duration of the guarantees and indemnities varies  and in many cases is indefinite 
the majority of our guarantees and indemnities do not provide for any limitation of the maximum potential future payments we could be obligated to make 
we have not recorded any liability for these guarantees and indemnities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of demand deposits and highly liquid money market funds 
our marketable securities consist of auction rate securities whose interest rates reset periodically generally every seven or twenty eight days and us treasury securities having maturities of less than eighteen months 
our main investment objectives are the preservation of investment capital and the maximization of after tax returns on our investment portfolio 
consequently  we invest in the securities that meet high credit quality standards and we limit the amount of our credit exposure to any one issuer 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or investment purposes 
interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities or variable interest rate characteristics of these instruments 
as of september   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
our long term debt consists of convertible senior notes which bear interest at a fixed rate of 
consequently  our results of operations and cash flows are not subject to any significant interest rate risk relating to our long term debt 
foreign exchange risk we transact business in various foreign currencies and we face foreign exchange risk on assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies 
the majority of our foreign exchange risks are not hedged  however  from time to time  we may utilize foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge a portion of our exposure to foreign exchange risk 
these hedging transactions are intended to offset the gains and losses we experience on foreign currency transactions with gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate our overall risk of foreign exchange gains and losses 
we do not enter into forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
at september   we held no foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
based on our overall currency rate exposure at september   a change in currency rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
