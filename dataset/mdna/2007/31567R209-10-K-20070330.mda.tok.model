item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
some of the statements in the following discussion are forward looking statements that are based on our current expectations  estimates and projections about our business and operations 
for a variety of reasons  including those described in forward looking statements and risk factors  our actual results may differ materially 
except for our prices and unless otherwise specified  all dollar amounts presented under results of operations below are in thousands since the merger was accounted for as a reverse acquisition  our historical financial statements for periods prior to the merger are the historical financial statements of old fibertower and include the results of first avenue from and after the merger 
as a result  our historical financial statements may not be indicative of our future results of operations 
executive overview we provide backhaul services to wireless carriers 
we began generating backhaul service revenue in by providing our services in dallas  texas 
we have commercial relationships with of the leading wireless carriers in the united states 
as of december   we had employees 
we market our services solely in the united states through our direct sales force 
we use a variety of metrics to assess the growth and evaluate the performance of our operations 
in addition to traditional financial evaluations  including performance against budget  we also consider non financial measurements  the most important of which are the number of sites deployed  number of sites billing  the number of customer locations billing and total t s billing 
the number of sites deployed represents sites from which we could deliver our services in a particular market 
customer locations billing are carrier locations  at which we currently provide t s 
a deployed site could have multiple customer carrier locations 
the number of sites billing represents the number of deployed sites on which we currently have sold at least one t to a customer 
a t is an increment of bandwidth that the company sells of approximately megabits per second 
we consider these to be key metrics because the number of sites constructed is a key factor in determining the amount of additional capital expenditures required to grow the network and the number of field personnel required to support our operations and sales growth 
sites billing  the number of customer locations billing and the number of t s per sites billing are all indicators of the productivity of the network 
as we expand into new markets  we incur significant up front costs for predevelopment site evaluation  site leases  cost of new capital equipment and construction costs 
these expenses are incurred well in advance of receiving revenues from customers 
accordingly  in most cases  we will incur substantial upfront costs in constructing sites  without any assurance of significant future revenues from those sites 
prior to  our strategy was to construct networks only where a site had committed customer orders prior to any network design or deployment activities 
beginning in late  in order to shorten the time a customer had to wait between commitment and initial service delivery  we implemented a new strategy to deploy networks where not all sites had committed customer orders at the start of deployment 
as a consequence  we may have an inventory of sites where t s are available following completion of a deployment project  including some sites where no t s are being used to deliver services 
as of december   we had deployed  sites  of which  had billing customers 
a deployed site may not yet be billing for various reasons including we have sold service at that site  but have not yet commenced providing service to the customer  or we have not yet sold any service at that site  but the site is located in a market in which wireless carriers who are our customers operate but with whom we may not have yet secured a commitment for this specific market 
sites where we have sold service but not yet commenced providing service may be subject to factors including the customer is not yet able to take delivery of the t  other elements of the network between the site and the drop off location are not yet constructed  so service cannot yet be delivered  or during certain periods in certain markets  we may complete construction of sites at a faster rate than the services associated with those sites can be provisioned to the customer  resulting in a temporary increase in the number of sites not yet billing 
our business plan depends on the fact that most  if not all  sites will generate revenue at some future date sufficient to fully recover our investment in property and equipment 
if we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from these sites in the future  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we have recognized relatively limited amounts of revenues to date  have generated operating and net losses and negative cash flows and expect to generate operating and net losses and negative cash flows for the foreseeable future 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
service revenues we generate revenue by charging a monthly recurring charge per circuit a circuit is one t line 
the durations of our customer contracts are generally three or five years 
we have derived more than of our historic revenues from two customers  cingular wireless and sprint nextel as shown below year ended december  cingular wireless sprint nextel accounts receivable from these two customers comprised the following percentages of our total accounts receivable balances at december  and as of december  cingular wireless sprint nextel cost of service revenues and operating expenses cost of service revenues are comprised primarily of engineering and maintenance personnel expenses  site lease expense for space leased at our sites  fiber service provider and fiber lease expenses  and costs associated with unsuccessful site acquisition 
we expect cost of service revenues to increase significantly in future periods as we execute our business plan to grow our network operations into other geographic locations and the continuing effects of statement of financial accounting standards r sfas r  which relates to accounting for share based payments for future grants 
sales and marketing expenses are comprised primarily of compensation and related benefits and travel expenses 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase in future periods as a result of expanding our operations and the continuing effects of sfas r for future grants 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of compensation and related benefits  recruiting fees  travel expenses  professional fees and insurance 
we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in future periods as a result of expanding operations and the continuing effects of sfas r for future grants 
depreciation and amortization expenses primarily consist of depreciation related to the deployment of network sites and the amortization of debt issuance costs 
we expect depreciation expenses to increase in future periods as a result of deploying and commencing depreciation on additional sites 
challenges facing our business in addition to the risks described in the section entitled risk factors  there are various challenges facing our business including deploying in a predictable manner  scaling our business and managing growth  acquiring new customers on existing sites  the concentrated nature of our customers and the emerging nature of our market 
deploying in a predictable manner can be challenging given the numerous landlords that we must deal with in order to lease space on sites  complying with the various zoning and permitting laws of different cities or districts  and managing the contractors involved with construction  program and project management 
we have taken steps to reduce deployment unpredictability by engaging with large  well established  turnkey vendors that are experienced in this area 
additionally  we concentrate on selecting sites owned by major tower operators with whom we already have agreements  which we believe will help minimize the risk of failing to negotiate a definitive lease for a site 
we are a rapidly growing company  and hiring qualified personnel and developing processes and systems rapidly are necessary in order to grow successfully 
if we cannot hire qualified employees  manage our growth and develop these systems and processes successfully  our business would be adversely affected 
as described above  acquiring customers on existing sites in a timely fashion is important for appropriate return on the capital that we invest  particularly since we incur significant costs in preparing sites to become operational 
in many cases  these costs are incurred well in advance of having committed revenue from a customer 
our business  financial condition and results of operations will be negatively affected if we do not obtain sufficient revenues from constructed sites 
we are a new entrant into a highly concentrated market with few potential customers in any particular market 
maintaining and growing our existing relationships with the leading wireless carriers and developing new relationships with other carriers are critical to our success 
we operate in an emerging market 
our future success depends on an increased demand for wireless services for voice and other mobile broadband services such as transmissions of photos or videos and internet communication 
internal controls as discussed in item a 
controls and procedures  our management has identified and reported to our audit committee and our independent registered public accounting firm  the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
the scope and complexity of our operations increased during late  principally as a result of the merger between old fibertower and first avenue  and our subsequent convertible debt offering 
as a result  we do not have a sufficient number of accounting personnel with the relevant technical accounting and financial reporting experience and skills  and we lack the requisite accounting systems which were largely non integrated as of december   to facilitate the preparation of timely and accurate consolidated financial statements  particularly with respect to accounting for significant unusual transactions 
consequently  material errors occurred  or have the potential to occur  in our i goodwill and deferred income tax liability accounts and ii embedded derivative financial instruments and other income and expense accounts  as well as in the related financial statement disclosures 
therefore  we recorded a number of adjustments to our consolidated financial statements  and related disclosures  prior to their inclusion in this report 
as a result of this material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  our ceo and cfo have concluded that  as of december   our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting were not effective 
we are implementing and will continue to implement measures intended to address this material weakness and improve our internal control over financial reporting 
while we believe that such measures will improve our internal controls  we recognize that the process of designing  implementing and maintaining effective internal controls is a continuous process that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environment 
if these measures are insufficient to address the issues raised  or if we discover additional internal control deficiencies or material weaknesses  we may fail to meet reporting requirements established by the sec and our obligations under the terms of the notes and our future indebtedness  our financial statements may contain material misstatements and require restatement and our business and operating results may be harmed 
results of operations presented below are selected statement of operations data for the years ended december   and that have been derived from our audited consolidated financial statements which are presented elsewhere in this document 
you should read this information together with the consolidated financial statements and related notes that are included elsewhere in this document 
our historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results that are expected in future periods 
statement of operations data in thousands year ended december  service revenues cost of service revenue excluding depreciation and amortization sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization other income expense  net net loss the following table sets forth selected statement of operations data as a percentage of our service revenues for each of the periods indicated 
year ended december  service revenues cost of service revenue excluding depreciation and amortization sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization interest income net of interest expense net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  service revenues for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily driven by the addition of new billing sites and a increase in billing t lines to our network during the previous months combined with adding new customers on existing sites 
included in the revenues for the year ended december  was revenue in the amount of million relating to nonrecurring penalties incurred by a customer for the early termination of certain circuits 
the acquisition of first avenue contributed million in revenue over the last four months of cost of service revenues excluding depreciation and amortization increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   as a result of additional costs incurred to support the billing sites that were added to the network during the past year and share based compensation of million recorded to cost of service revenues in the year ended december  service revenues tend to lag cost of service revenues initially for new sites  especially in new markets  because there are certain upfront costs that are generally incurred for a period of time before a site generates revenue 
these costs include site evaluation expenses  lease payments that are incurred as a site is being constructed  payments to fiber service providers in order to ensure sufficient capacity is available to carry new traffic  as well as costs related to unsuccessful site acquisitions that are incurred during deployment 
due to the fact that most of our sites are relatively new  cost of service revenues excluding depreciation and amortization has exceeded service revenues 
the acquisition of first avenue contributed million in cost of service revenues for the last four months of sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  due to the expansion of marketing efforts to a limited number of customers  and the effect of stock based compensation expense  which contributed million in expense for the year ended december  the acquisition of first avenue contributed million in sales and marketing expense for the last four months of general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase is the result of increases in personnel costs due to an increase in headcount  stock based compensation  which contributed million in expense for the year ended december   and professional fees 
the acquisition of first avenue contributed million in general and administrative expenses for the last four months of depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to an increase of  network sites that were deployed during the past months 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to increased interest income resulting from cash proceeds from the million series a preferred stock financing that closed in july and the million of gross proceeds from the convertible notes issued in november interest expense increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to interest incurred as a result of million in convertible notes issued in november year ended december  compared to year ended december  service revenues for increased to million from million in this increase was primarily driven by the addition of new billing sites to our network during the year combined with adding new customers on our existing sites 
cost of service revenues excluding depreciation and amortization increased or million to million for  compared to million for as a result of costs incurred to support the expanding network 
the increase in cost of revenues was due to the increase in upfront costs associated with the addition of the new sites to the network in advance of receiving significant revenues from these sites 
sales and marketing expenses increased  or million  to million for  compared to million for this increase was a result of additional salaries and benefits to support our sales efforts as well as increases in travel expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased or million to million for  from million for this increase was the result of increases in personnel costs due to increases in headcount and professional fees to support our growth 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for this increase resulted from an increase of deployed sites in our network 
other income expense  net totaled million for as compared to million for this increase was due to increased interest income resulting from the million series a preferred stock financing that closed in july liquidity and capital resources our business does not currently generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our short term or long term liquidity needs  and we may not be able to generate cash flow from operations sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the future  which would require us to continue to raise funds through external sources 
we have relied on the proceeds from equity and debt financings to provide cash for our operations 
on november   we completed the sale of million of convertible senior secured notes due on november  notes 
the notes were sold to two initial purchasers in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes are fully guaranteed  jointly and severally  by us and each of our subsidiaries guarantees 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these notes 
we anticipate that we will use approximately million of cash for investing activities during to expand our network 
our primary liquidity needs arise from capital requirements necessary to expand our network and fund operating losses 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents  certificates of deposit and short term investments of approximately million at december  we believe this gives us sufficient liquidity to continue operations at least through december  and beyond 
we also require cash to service the interest on the notes described above 
at the time of the closing of the sale of the notes to the initial purchasers  we deposited into an escrow account million of the net proceeds from the notes offering  which  together with the proceeds from the investment thereof  will be sufficient to make the first four interest payments on the notes 
thereafter  we have the option to pay interest on the next four interest payment dates in additional notes 
our ability to pay our expenses and make payments due on the notes depends on our future performance  which will be affected by financial  business  economic  legislative and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
we anticipate that we will continue to invest significantly in deploying our network over the next several years 
the size of our capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including our ability to grow revenues  control costs  and deploy our network on a timely basis according to plan and customer requirements 
we will require significant cash expenditures related to capital construction costs and operating losses 
we intend to obtain financing through the issuance of additional equity or debt securities  or both 
there can be no assurance that this additional financing will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to raise sufficient funds  we may need to reduce our operations or delay our expansion 
in addition  we may be required to sell assets or incur additional debt  or we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or before maturity 
we may not be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
in addition  the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from adopting any of these alternatives 
cash flow analysis our principal liquidity requirements are primarily for working capital purposes and the expansion of our network through our investment in network equipment and site acquisition and construction costs 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities increased by million to million compared to cash used in operations of million for the year ended december  the negative cash flow from operations in was primarily caused by a net loss of million for the year  and a decrease of million in accounts payable due to the payment of vendors 
the net loss for the year includes non cash charges of million  which consist primarily of million of depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation of million  million in accretion of convertible notes 
net cash used in operating activities increased by million to million in  compared to million in this increase was principally the result of an increase in net loss of million in  which was offset by an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million and non cash charges of million  which consists principally of depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million is due principally to the expansion of our network 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities consisted primarily of our investment in network equipment and site construction costs as well as the back office systems to support the network 
in addition  in we received million in cash and maturing certificates of deposit from our merger with first avenue networks  net of million in transaction related expenses 
net cash used in investing activities were as follows in thousands period ended amount year ended december in the year ended december   we completed deployment on  sites spending million in capital expenditures 
in and  we completed deployment on and sites  respectively and incurred related capital expenditures of million and million  respectively 
we anticipate that we will use approximately million of cash for investing activities during to expand our network 
we invested million in short term investments 
additionally  we purchased million in us treasury securities to fund the restricted escrow account established to pay for the first four interest payments on the convertible senior secured notes 
financing activities on november   we completed the sale of the notes  which provided million in net proceeds 
the notes were sold to two initial purchasers in a private placement exempt from the registration requirements of the securities act of  as amended 
the notes are fully guaranteed  jointly and severally  by us and each of our subsidiaries 
as part of the private placement we incurred million in debt issuance costs that were paid at closing 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these notes 
net cash was also provided by the exercise of stock options and amounted to   and  in  and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities in and was derived almost exclusively from the proceeds of various series of old fibertower preferred stock financings that provided proceeds of million and million  net of closing costs  in and  respectively 
all of old fibertower s preferred stock was converted into common stock in connection with the merger 
in  cash was used in financing activities relating to loans aggregating million to four stockholders these notes receivable from stockholders were repaid in august in connection with the merger 
debt obligations and restricted cash and investments long term accounts payable consisted of trade payables with extended payment terms relating to our purchase of equipment  software and professional services from certain vendors 
two of these vendor contracts  which contain the nonrevolving lines of credit described below  assessed interest on unpaid balances million as of december  and none at december  at per annum 
two of our vendor contracts contained nonrevolving lines of credit for the purchase of equipment in the aggregate amount of million through july  as of december  and  we had no additional borrowing capacity under these lines of credit 
as of december   we had utilized million of these lines of credit 
the aggregate outstanding balance was million as of december  none at december  
also  in relation to a service supplier agreement that was executed in  we were required to maintain a restricted cash equivalent balance with a financial institution of million as of december  and we also maintain five additional letters of credit with a financial institution in connection with other obligations 
four of these letters of credit  which expire between june  and november   totaled  at december  and  at december  and and were collateralized by cash equivalents of  as of december  and  as of december  and  respectively 
the fifth letter of credit expires in june and totaled  at december  and at december  and the total restricted cash and cash equivalents balance as of december  and was million  and million  respectively 
at december   we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of million that were held in bank accounts  money market mutual funds  short term obligations of the federal home loan mortgage corporation and commercial paper issued by major us and foreign corporations and financial institutions 
in addition  under the terms of our november convertible note agreement  we have an additional million invested in restricted us treasury securities 
we believe we have limited exposure to financial market risk including changes in interest rates 
we believe the fair value of the investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the investment portfolio 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total fiscal fiscal fiscal beyond fiscal contractual obligations operating lease obligations asset retirement obligations convertible senior secured notes other commercial commitments letters of credit total critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
for additional information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates  please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements in item the application of these policies requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our accounting estimates on historical experience and other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with our audit committee 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies represent the more significant judgments and estimates made in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies and estimates we make in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue and expense recognition we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the services have been provided to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable and the collection of the sales price is reasonably assured 
amounts billed in advance of providing service are deferred and recorded as deferred revenues 
incremental direct costs of service activation are charged to expense as incurred 
we purchase electricity and lease collocation site space from certain of our customers 
we receive an identifiable benefit in exchange for the amounts paid to our customers and we can reasonably estimate the fair value of the purchased electricity and leased tower site space 
therefore  we charge such amounts to cost of service revenues as incurred  unless the amount paid exceeds the respective fair value  in which case the differential is recorded as a reduction of service revenues 
other consideration provided to customers  such as customer incentives  is recorded as a reduction of service revenues 
accounts receivable allowances we encounter billing disputes with certain customers in the ordinary course of business in the telecommunications industry 
we believe the impact of such disputes on our accounts receivable and service revenues is reasonably estimable based on historical experience 
accordingly  we maintain an allowance  through charges to service revenues  based on management s best estimate of the ultimate resolution of customer disputes 
we provided an allowance for billing disputes of as of december  none at december  
we perform ongoing evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral or other credit enhancements 
we will record an allowance for bad debts based on historical experience and our best estimate of future credit losses 
we provided an allowance for doubtful accounts of as of december  none at december  
useful life assignments and impairment evaluations associated with long lived assets  including intangible assets property and equipment  which consists principally of network equipment and capitalized site development costs  are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are calculated using the straight line method over the estimated economic lives ranging from three to ten years 
depreciation is commenced when the assets are placed in service 
the economic lives are estimated at the time assets are placed in service and are based on experience and anticipated technological changes 
in assessing the recoverability of our property and equipment  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
property and equipment are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized whenever i the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset and ii the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying value 
when an impairment loss is identified  the carrying value of the asset is reduced to its fair value 
as described more fully below  we evaluate our intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually and between annual evaluations if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
in cases where required  an impairment provision will be recognized in an amount by which the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of such assets 
in december  we tested our intangible assets pursuant to the guidance in sfas this testing did not result in any impairment charges against the intangible assets  fcc licenses recoverability of the carrying value of fcc licenses is dependent on numerous factors  including successful deployment of networks and radio links or sales of such assets to a third party 
we consider the fcc licenses to have an indefinite useful life under the provisions of sfas we perform an impairment test on these assets on an annual basis or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate the assets might be impaired 
the impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the fcc licenses with the carrying value of the assets 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
our licenses are integral to our business 
as a result  we believe that we must focus on protecting this valuable asset as our business plan evolves 
under fcc rules  licenses are renewed based upon service provided as of the renewal date 
the fcc does not consider service provided during the ten year period for which the licenses are granted 
they evaluate whether substantial service is provided as of the renewal date 
we will continue to lease spectrum  utilizing this non capital intensive method to put more of our fcc licenses to work 
we may also introduce new product offerings utilizing our spectrum 
under our current business plan  we believe that we will meet the fcc s substantial service requirement as of the various license renewal dates 
we will continue to periodically assess our progress toward meeting these requirements 
if at any time we determine that we will most likely not meet these requirements  we will first test the fcc licenses for impairment and then we will modify the life of the particular fcc licenses and begin amortizing the cost over the remaining license period 
to evaluate whether an impairment of our fcc licenses has occurred  we consider a number of factors  including i the change in our public equity value  ii the change in the public equity value of companies providing similar services or holding similar fcc licenses  iii private purchases of similar licenses  iv discounted cash flow analyses for the future cash flows relating to the fcc licenses  and v the results of fcc spectrum auctions for similar spectrum 
recoverability of the carrying value of our fcc licenses is dependent on successful deployment of networks and radio links or sales of such assets to a third party 
at december   fibertower s fcc licenses had a carrying value of million 
goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets of acquired companies is allocated to goodwill 
under the provisions of sfas  goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we have one reporting unit for consideration in the application of the impairment requirements of sfas when determining the fair value of this reporting unit  we consider a combination of the market price of our common equity and discounted cash flows 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows  discount rates and other factors to determine if an impairment has occurred 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
future declines in our goodwill value could result in an impairment charge to earnings  increasing our operating loss in future periods 
our stock price could decline as a result of such a charge to earnings 
at december   fibertower s goodwill had a carrying value of million 
asset retirement obligations we account for asset retirement obligations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
we recognize liabilities for asset retirement obligations relating to the estimated costs of removing network equipment from our leased colocation sites  as stipulated in the related lease agreements 
the asset retirement obligations are recognized in the period in which they are incurred if a reasonable estimate of their fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related long lived assets and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful life of ten years 
we calculate the net present value of the retirement obligation assuming a credit adjusted  risk free interest rate of 
we also assume the settlement date for removing the network equipment from our leased colocation sites to be ten years from the date the asset is placed into service  which is the expected term of the related leases 
we monitor the estimates and assumptions used in determining our asset retirement obligations and adjust them accordingly if deemed necessary 
deferred taxes we have recorded a full valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would be reported as follows 
to the extent any of the  of valuation allowance associated with the first avenue merger is subsequently reversed  it will be recognized first as a reduction of goodwill  then as a reduction of other intangible assets  and  lastly  as a reduction of that period s income tax expense 
to the extent any of the valuation allowance related to first avenue s predecessor is subsequently reversed as a result of the use of net operating loss carryforwards  it will be recognized as a direct addition to additional paid in capital 
to the extent that an adjustment to the valuation allowance arises for any other reason  it will be recorded as a reduction of income tax expense in the period such determination is made 
leases we lease our office space  certain network facilities and vehicles under operating leases  and account for these leases in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
most of our operating lease arrangements represent agreements made with landlords for space leased at our colocation sites 
the term of these agreements is typically for five years and we have the unilateral ability and intent to extend the term of these site lease agreements such that the minimum lease periods equal or slightly exceed the estimated year useful lives of the property and equipment located at such leased sites 
we also do not believe there are any explicit or implicit penalties  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for leases  for failure to renew any site leases at the end of the respective assumed lease terms of approximately years that would extend the lease term past the assumed terms of approximately years 
for leases that contain scheduled rent escalation provisions  we record the total rent payable during the lease term on a straight line basis over the lease term 
stock based compensation prior to january   we accounted for stock based compensation paid to employees under the recognition and measurement provisions set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb under the intrinsic value method set forth in apb  no compensation cost was required to be recognized for awards that had an exercise price equal to  or greater than  the market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement no 
revised of the financial accounting standards board fasb  share based payment sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
r requires the fair value of all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as expense over the employees requisite service period 
we adopted sfas no 
r on a prospective basis effective january  under the prospective method we continue to account for previously outstanding stock options at the date of adoption of sfas no 
r under apb the application of sfas no 
r increased our net loss for the year ended december  by million per share out of a total share based compensation of million 
we accounted for stock options granted to nonemployees prior to using the fair value method set forth in sfas no 
effective january   we account for share based payments to nonemployees based on the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees 
we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes merton option valuation at model and the assumptions shown in note  stockholders equity  in the condensed consolidated financial statements 
we estimate the expected term of options granted based on the guidance in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
expected volatilities were calculated based on the historical volatilities of similar public companies in the telecommunications industry 
we base the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of the grant 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes merton option valuation model 
we use the straight line method for share based payment expense recognition  and estimate forfeitures and only recognize share based payment expense for those awards expected to vest 
our estimated forfeiture rate is based on our historical forfeiture experiences 
we may elect to use different assumptions under the black scholes merton option valuation model in the future if our experience indicates that a different measure is preferable  which could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share 
related party transactions during the years ended december  and  we leased colocation space from certain stockholders that i own greater than of our outstanding equity securities and or ii have representatives who serve on our board of directors 
one of these related parties also provided us with certain services pertaining to its network operations center during such years 
the aggregate operating expenses included in the accompanying statements of operations for years ended december  and  respectively  pertaining to these lease and service arrangements were approximately  and  respectively 
we do not consider the corresponding amounts for the year ended december  to be material to our financial statements 
as a result of the merger  the ownership interests of one related party is less than of our outstanding equity securities and transactions with this entity during the fourth quarter of is excluded 
during the years ended december   and  i a member of our board of directors and ii one of our investors served as consultants to the company on various aspects of our business and strategy 
these individuals were compensated for their services with varying amounts of cash and stock options  which we do not consider to be material to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
representatives from three entities holding approximately of the outstanding common stock serve on our board of directors

as of december   we believe we have limited exposure to financial market risk  including changes in interest rates  because our investments have a maturity of less than three months 
we believe the fair value of the investment portfolio will not be significantly impacted by changes in interest rates due mainly to the short term nature of the investment portfolio  although future interest income would be impacted by changes in interest rates as well as the amount of funds available to be invested in such securities

the fair value of such notes is dependent upon a number of factors including future interest rates and the market value of fibertower s common stock 
the notes are traded in a very thinly traded resale market
