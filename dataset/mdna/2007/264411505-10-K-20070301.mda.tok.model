item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a self administered and self managed reit that began operations through a related entity in as of december   we owned or jointly controlled industrial  office and retail properties including properties under development  consisting of approximately million square feet  and owned or jointly controlled more than  acres of unencumbered land with an estimated future development potential of more than million square feet of industrial  office and retail properties 
we provide the following services for our properties and for certain properties owned by third parties and joint ventures property leasing  property management  construction  development  and other tenant related services 
management philosophy and priorities our key business and financial strategies for the future include the following our business objective is to increase funds from operations ffo by i maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing properties  ii developing and acquiring new properties for rental operations in our existing markets  iii expanding geographically by acquiring and developing properties in new markets  iv using our construction expertise to act as a general contractor in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis  v developing and repositioning properties in our existing markets and other markets which we will sell through our service operations property sale program  and vi providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties 
see the year in review section below for further explanation and definition of ffo 
our financing strategy is to actively manage the components of our capital structure including common and preferred equity and debt to maintain a conservatively leveraged balance sheet and investment grade ratings from our credit rating agencies 
this strategy provides us with the financial flexibility to fund both development and acquisition opportunities 
we seek to maintain a well balanced  conservative and flexible capital structure by i extending and sequencing the maturity dates of debt  ii borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than  iii pursuing current and future long term debt financings and refinancing generally on an unsecured basis  iv maintaining conservative debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios  and v issuing attractively priced perpetual preferred stock for of our total capital structure 
year in review during  we successfully executed on our strategy that we began in earnest in to improve our portfolio of held for investment buildings through our capital recycling program  increasing our development pipeline to over billion  and initiating geographic expansion that we anticipate will provide future earnings growth 
as a result of these accomplishments  we achieved steady operating results while maintaining a strong balance sheet 
net income available for common shareholders for the year ended december   was million  or per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted for the year ended the decrease is primarily attributable to the million gain from the sale of a portfolio of real estate properties the industrial portfolio sale that occurred in which was partially offset by income generated by current year building sales  acquired properties and organic growth 
through increased leasing activity  we achieved a growth in rental revenues from continuing operations in over as our in service portfolio occupancy increased from at the end of to at the end of as an important performance metric for us as a real estate company  ffo available to common shareholders totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in which is the result of the time necessary to redeploy the proceeds from the industrial portfolio sale noted above into ffo generating assets 
industry analysts and investors use ffo as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust reit 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry investors and analysts have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  improves the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and makes comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management considers ffo to be a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  ffo assists in comparing the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
the following table summarizes the calculation of ffo for the years ended december in thousands net income available for common shareholders adjustments depreciation and amortization company share of joint venture depreciation and amortization earnings from depreciable property sales wholly owned earnings from depreciable property sales share of joint venture minority interest share of adjustments funds from operations throughout  we continued to maintain a conservative balance sheet and investment grade debt ratings from moody s baa  standard poors bbb and fitch bbb 
our debt to total market capitalization ratio total market capitalization is defined as the total market value of all outstanding common and preferred shares and units of limited partner interest in our operating partnership plus outstanding indebtedness of at december  compared to at december  continues to provide us financial flexibility to fund new investments 
highlights of our debt financing activity in are as follows in january  we renewed our line of credit  including the extension of the maturity date to january and the increase of borrowing capacity by million to billion with interest rates ranging from libor 
to libor 
as of december we had million outstanding on our line of credit as of december  through new issuances  as well as assumptions of debt in conjunction with our acquisitions  we added million of new secured debt in at a weighted average interest rate of and we retired million of secured debt of which million was variable rate 
we issued million of unsecured debt at a weighted average interest rate of and retired million of unsecured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 
we issued million of exchangeable senior notes exchangeable notes in november the exchangeable notes can be exchanged for shares of our common stock upon certain events as well as at any time beginning on august  and ending on the second business day prior to the maturity date 
the exchangeable notes will have an initial exchange rate of approximately common shares per  principal amount of the notes  representing an exchange price of approximately per share of our common stock and an exchange premium of approximately based on the last reported sale price of per share of our common stock on the date of issuance 
the initial exchange rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances  including increases in our rate of dividends 
upon exchange  the holders of the exchangeable notes would receive cash equal to the principal amount of the note and  at our option  either cash or shares of common stock for the remaining balance due 
in order to reduce potential dilution of our common stock  we purchased a capped call option with the proceeds of the exchangeable notes offering that allows us to buy our common shares  up to a maximum of approximately million shares or our common stock  from the option counterparties at prescribed prices 
the capped call option will terminate upon the earlier of the maturity date of the related exchangeable notes or the first day all of the related exchangeable notes are no longer outstanding due to exchange or otherwise 
the capped call option  which cost million  was recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity and effectively increased the exchange price to above the stock price on the issuance date 
on the equity side of our balance sheet  we repurchased approximately million common shares for approximately million from the proceeds of our exchangeable notes issuance 
additionally  we issued two new series of preferred equity securities  series m cumulative redeemable preferred shares and series n cumulative redeemable preferred shares  for total gross proceeds of million while we redeemed our series i cumulative redeemable preferred shares of million 
we continued strategic initiatives to expand geographically and projects to leverage our development  construction and management capabilities as follows we completed the acquisition of a washington dc metropolitan area portfolio of suburban in service office and light industrial properties  the assets of a related real estate management company  as well as significant undeveloped land positions all referred to as the mark winkler portfolio for a purchase price of approximately million 
in december  we contributed of the in service properties to joint ventures in which we hold a continuing interest 
we will contribute eight in service properties to the joint ventures in the first quarter of we completed the purchase of a portfolio of industrial real estate properties in savannah  georgia consisting of buildings for a purchase price of approximately million 
we increased our investment in undeveloped land to provide greater opportunities to use our development and construction expertise in the improving economic cycle 
throughout  we completed land acquisitions totaling million 
the new land positions include industrial  office and retail positions in several markets  including the washington dc  baltimore  houston  and phoenix markets  which we entered during we disposed of non strategic wholly owned held for rental properties  most notably our entire cleveland industrial portfolio  for million of gross proceeds 
additionally  unconsolidated subsidiaries disposed of non strategic held for rental properties of which our share of the gross proceeds totaled million 
these transactions were a continuation of our long term strategy of recycling assets into higher yielding new developments 
finally  we will continue to develop long term investment assets to be held in our portfolio and develop assets to be sold upon completion 
with over billion in our development pipeline at december   we are encouraged about the long term growth opportunities in our business 
key performance indicators our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our office and industrial properties rental operations 
the following highlights the areas of rental operations that we consider critical for future revenue growth 
all square footage totals and occupancy percentages reflect both wholly owned properties and properties in joint ventures 
occupancy analysis as discussed above  our ability to maintain occupancy rates is a principal driver of our results of operations 
the following table sets forth occupancy information regarding our in service portfolio of rental properties as of december in thousands  except percentage data total percent of square feet total square feet percent occupied type industrial service centers bulk office other total we experienced continued strong occupancy in our in service portfolio with the overall increase driven primarily by a increase in the occupancy of our office portfolio 
lease expiration and renewals our ability to maintain and grow occupancy rates primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re lease expiring space

our lease renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively consistent at a success rate 
we do not presently expect this renewal percentage in to differ from that experienced in future development another source of growth in earnings is the development of additional properties 
these properties should provide future earnings through income upon sale or from rental operations growth as they are placed in service 
we had million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs of billion at december   compared to million square feet and total costs of million at december  we have increased our development pipeline significantly through and will continue to focus on the development side of our business in the following table summarizes our properties under development as of december  in thousands  except percentage data anticipated in service date square feet percent leased project costs anticipated stabilized return held for rental st quarter nd quarter rd quarter thereafter service operations buildings st quarter nd quarter rd quarter thereafter total acquisition and disposition activity we continued to selectively dispose of non strategic properties in sales proceeds related to the dispositions of wholly owned held for rental properties were million  which included the disposition of our entire portfolio of industrial properties in the cleveland market 
our share of proceeds from sales of properties within unconsolidated joint ventures  of which we have a less than interest  totaled million 
in  proceeds from the disposition of non strategic properties totaled billion for wholly owned held for rental properties  as the result of the industrial portfolio sale  and million for our share of property sales from unconsolidated joint ventures

the primary causes of the increase in rental income from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below in  we acquired new properties and placed development projects in service 
these acquisitions and developments are the primary factor in the overall increase in rental revenue for the year ended compared to as they provided incremental revenues of million and million respectively 
these acquisitions totaled million on million square feet and were leased at december  acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in provided million and million  respectively  of incremental revenue in our in service occupancy increased from at december   to at december  rental income includes lease termination fees 
lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
lease termination fees increased from million in to million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies 
these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
these earnings increased from million in to million in during  our joint ventures sold non strategic buildings  with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling million 
during the second quarter of  one of our ventures sold three buildings  with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling million 
rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statement of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental expenses office industrial non segment total real estate taxes office industrial non segment total rental expenses and real estate taxes for have increased from by million and million  respectively  as the result of acquisition and development activity in and as well as from our increase in occupancy over the past two years 
interest expense interest expense increased from million in to million in  as a result of the following interest expense on the unsecured line of credit increased by million from as the result of increased borrowings throughout the year  as well as increased interest rates 
interest expense on unsecured notes increased by million as the result of an overall increase in borrowings used mainly to fund acquisitions and development 
interest expense on secured debt increased by million as the result of the increase in borrowings in amortization of deferred financing fees increased by million as the result of additional borrowings in offsetting the above increases  capitalized interest increased by million as the result of increased development activity 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in as the result of increases in our held for rental asset base from acquisitions and developments during and service operations service operations primarily consist of sales of properties developed or acquired with the intent to sell within a short period of time and the leasing  management  construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties 
these operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy  as leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations 
service operations earnings increased from million in to million in the following are the factors related to the increase in service operations earnings in our service operations building development and sales program  whereby a building is developed or repositioned by us and then sold  is a significant component of earnings from service operations 
during  we generated pre tax gains of million from the sale of nine properties compared to million from the sale of ten properties in profit margins on these types of building sales fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold  the strength of the underlying tenant and nature of the sale  such as a pre contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market 
partially offsetting the increased gains from our service operations building development and sales program was the effect of a decreased focus on third party construction services as well as the fact that in the first quarter of  we recognized million of a non recurring deferred gain associated with the sale of our landscaping operations in general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in general and administrative expenses consist of two components 
the first component is direct expenses that are not attributable to specific assets such as legal fees  external audit fees  marketing costs  investor relations expenses and other corporate overhead 
the second component is the unallocated overhead costs associated with the operation of our owned properties and service operations  including construction  leasing and maintenance operations 
overhead costs not allocated to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses from was largely attributable to an increase in our overall pool of overhead costs to support our current and anticipated future growth 
discontinued operations the results of operations for properties sold during the year or designated as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of net earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues  rental expenses  real estate taxes  allocated interest expense  depreciation expense and minority interest  as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties 
we classified the operations of buildings as discontinued operations as of december  these buildings consist of industrial  office and three retail properties 
as a result  we classified net income from operations  net of minority interest  of million  million and million as net income from discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these properties  were sold during  properties were sold during  properties were sold during  and operating properties are classified as held for sale at december  the gains on disposal of these properties  net of impairment adjustment and minority interest  of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are also reported in discontinued operations

service operations earnings increased from million in to million in the increase reflects higher construction volumes partially offset by increased staffing costs in other factors impacting service operations are discussed below 
our service operations development and sales program  whereby a building is developed or repositioned by us and then sold  is a significant component of construction and development income 
during  we generated pre tax gains of million from the sale of properties compared to million from the sale of six properties in profit margins on these types of building sales fluctuate by sale depending on the type of property being sold  the strength of the underlying tenant and nature of the sale  such as a pre contracted purchase price for a primary tenant versus a sale on the open market 
in  we experienced an increase in our third party construction business as evidenced by the increase in general contractor revenues in over we achieved a slight increase in our profit margins during  which reflected improved pricing in certain markets and our ability to select more profitable projects as resources are re positioned to our increasing held for investment development pipeline 
in the first quarter of  we recognized million of a non recurring deferred gain associated with the sale of our landscaping operations in the gain was deferred as a result of future performance provisions contained in the original sales agreement 
as a result of contract renegotiations effective in the first quarter of  all future performance provisions were removed and the deferred gain was recognized 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in general and administrative expenses consist of two components 
the first component is direct expenses not attributable to specific assets such as legal fees  external audit fees  marketing costs  investor relations expenses and other corporate overhead 
the second component is the unallocated overhead costs associated with the operation of our owned properties and service operations  including construction  leasing and maintenance operations 
overhead costs not allocated to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of an increase in payroll expenses associated with long term compensation plans and an increase in the number of employees to support our overall growth 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions  and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors 
the following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements  degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions accounting for joint ventures we analyze our investments in joint ventures under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation 
to the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities  we further assess under the guidelines of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf  statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures  accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements and fasb no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  to determine if the venture should be consolidated 
we have equity interests ranging from in joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or substantial participating rights 
control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day to day operations  refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner 
we use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial polices 
under the equity method of accounting  our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet  however  the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet 
cost capitalization direct and certain indirect costs  including interest  clearly associated with and incremental to the development  construction  leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property 
we capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
we believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry 
the interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt 
we also capitalize direct and indirect costs  including interest costs  on vacant space during extended lease up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use 
if costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease  then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed 
once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space  project costs are no longer capitalized 
we cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease up periods after the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains occupancy 
in addition  all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
in assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized  we first allocate payroll costs  on a department by department basis  among activities for which capitalization is warranted ie  construction  development and leasing and those for which capitalization is not warranted ie  property management  maintenance  acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions 
to the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non capitalizable activities  the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity 
once the payroll costs are allocated  the non payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs 
to ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized  the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed 
these standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease 
these standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity 
the use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized 
impairment of real estate investments we evaluate our real estate investments upon occurrence of significant changes in the operations  but not less than annually  to assess whether any impairment indications are present that affect the recovery of the recorded value 
if any real estate investment is considered to be impaired  a loss is provided to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its estimated fair value 
we utilize the guidelines established under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  to determine if impairment conditions exist 
under sfas  we review the expected undiscounted cash flows of each property in our held for rental portfolio to determine if there are any indications of impairment of a property 
the review of anticipated cash flows involves subjective assumptions of estimated occupancy and rental rates and ultimate residual value 
in addition to reviewing anticipated cash flows  we assess other factors such as changes in business climate and legal factors that may affect the ultimate value of the property 
these assumptions are subjective and the anticipated cash flows may not ultimately be achieved 
real estate assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying value amount or the fair value less estimated cost to sell 
acquisition of real estate property in accordance with sfas  business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
the allocation to tangible assets buildings  tenant improvements and land is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the remaining purchase price is allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet  both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values  based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are depreciated over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
valuation of receivables we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  we perform in house credit review and analysis on major existing tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
we have established the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables and record allowances we maintain a tenant watch list containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk 
various factors such as late rent payments  lease or debt instrument defaults  and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list 
as a matter of policy  we reserve the entire receivable balance  including straight line rent  of any tenant with an amount outstanding over days 
straight line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long term risk  regardless of the status of rent receivables  are reviewed and reserved as necessary 
revenue recognition on construction contracts we recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method 
using this method  profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts 
a portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
this revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes 
with regard to critical accounting policies  management has discussed the following with the audit committee criteria for identifying and selecting  methodology in applying  and impact on the financial statements 
the audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies we identified 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements over the next twelve months  including payments of dividends and distributions  as well as recurring capital expenditures relating to maintaining our current real estate assets  primarily through the following working capital  net cash provided by operating activities  and proceeds received from real estate dispositions although we historically have not used any other sources of funds to pay for recurring capital expenditures on our current real estate investments  we may rely on the temporary use of borrowings or property disposition proceeds needed to fund such expenditures during periods of high leasing volume 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage debt maturities  refinancing of long term debt  preferred share redemptions  the retirement of unsecured notes and amounts outstanding under the unsecured credit facility  property acquisitions  financing of development activities and other non recurring capital improvements  primarily from the following sources issuance of additional equity  including common and preferred stock  issuance of additional debt securities  undistributed cash provided by operating activities  if any  and proceeds received from real estate dispositions 
rental operations we believe our principal source of liquidity  cash flows from rental operations  provides a stable source of cash to fund operational expenses 
we believe this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition except for periodic straight line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition 
we are subject to risks of decreased occupancy through market conditions  as well as tenant defaults and bankruptcies  and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re letting of properties  which would result in reduced cash flow from operations 
however  we believe that these risks are mitigated by our relatively strong market presence in most of our locations and the fact that we perform in house credit review and analysis on major tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
credit facility we had one unsecured line of credit available at december   summarized as follows in thousands borrowing maturity interest outstanding description capacity date rate at december  unsecured line of credit january libor 
we use this line of credit to fund development activities  acquire additional rental properties and provide working capital 
the line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line  at rates lower than the stated interest rate  subject to certain restrictions 
interest rates on the amounts outstanding on the unsecured line of credit as of december   ranged from libor 
to libor 
equal to and as of december  the line of credit also contains financial covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and defined levels of performance  including those related to variable interest indebtedness  consolidated net worth and debt to market capitalization 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our line of credit 
debt and equity securities on july   we filed with the sec an automatic shelf registration statement on form s relating to the offer and sale  from time to time  of an indeterminate amount of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock  depositary shares and warrants 
from time to time  we expect to issue additional securities under this new automatic shelf registration statement to fund the development and acquisition of additional rental properties and to fund the repayment of the credit facility and other long term debt upon maturity 
on february   we filed a resale shelf registration statement on form s with respect to  shares of our common stock issuable upon the exchange or redemption of the exchangeable notes 
recipients of such common stock  whom we refer to as the selling shareholders  may use the prospectus filed as part of the resale shelf registration statement to resell  from time to time  the shares of our common stock that we may issue to them upon the exchange or redemption of the exchangeable notes
