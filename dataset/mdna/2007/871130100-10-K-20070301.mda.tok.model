table of contents on november  we acquired mobile  inc which we renamed sybase  inc  a privately held mobile messaging and content delivery company for approximately million 
sybase delivers mobile data and messaging  premium content  and value added services for leading mobile operators  content providers  global brands  media companies  and financial institutions worldwide 
total revenues and operating loss of mobile for period from november  through december   were million and million  respectively 
executive overview our business sybase is a global enterprise software and services company exclusively focused on managing and mobilizing information from the data center to the point of action 
we provide open  cross platform solutions that securely deliver information anytime  anywhere  enabling customers to create an information edge 
our value proposition involves enabling the unwired enterprise through integrated applications and solutions designed to manage information across the enterprise  allowing customers to extract more value from their information technology it investments 
we deliver a full range of solutions to ensure that customer information is securely managed and mobilized to the point of action  including enterprise and mobile databases  middleware  synchronization  encryption and device management software  and mobile messaging services 
during the fourth quarter of we expanded our reach by acquiring mobile  a privately held global provider of mobile messaging and content delivery services 
mobile extends our unwired enterprise strategy with the addition of two new enterprise channels mobile operators and content providers and an extensive  operator grade network with connections to approximately mobile operators around the world 
through mobile s global footprint  sybase enables enterprises to deliver data and applications to over of the world s mobile subscriber population 
mobile will operate as a separate business unit  renamed sybase see note eleven business combinations to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item our business is organized into three business segments ipg  which principally focuses on enterprise class database servers  integration and development products  ias  which provides mobile database and mobile enterprise solutions  and sybase  which provides global services for mobile messaging interoperability and the management and distribution of mobile content 
for further discussion of our business segments and principal products  see business  part i  item and note ten segment and geographical information to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item in the second half of  we successfully launched major upgrades to many of the key products in our ias segment 
in the third quarter of  we released sql anywhere  the latest version of our market leading small footprint database  and unwired accelerator  an innovative mobile solution that enables users to access their enterprise applications  data and business processes from mobile devices 
in the fourth quarter of  we delivered afaria  our award winning frontline management and security solution  onebridge  our mobile email and data synchronization solution  and information anywhere suite  a new offering combining mobile email  device management  enterprise to edge security and enterprise application enablement in a secure scalable mobile software platform 
from our ipg segment  we released data integration suite in the fourth quarter of this new offering combines essential data integration techniques including replication  federation  real time events and unstructured data search with integrated modeling  meta data  development and administration 
our results total revenues were million for  compared to million for  and million for the increase in total revenues from to was primarily due to a million percent increase in ias revenues  a million percent increase in ipg revenues and million in sybase revenues  due to the acquisition of mobile in the fourth quarter of 
table of contents the increase in ias revenues from to was primarily driven by a million percent increase in license revenue and a million percent increase in service revenue 
the growth in ias license revenues was largely attributable to the increase in revenues from mobility solutions including  embedded databases  device management  security and e mail products including those acquired in our acquisition of extended systems 
the increase in ipg revenues from to was primarily attributable to a million percent increase in license revenues 
the growth in ipg license revenue was primarily driven by a percent increase in revenue from our adaptive server enterprise product and a percent increase in revenues from our replication server product 
we reported net income of million for  compared to net income of million for  and million in our operating income was million percent operating margin compared to million percent operating margin in the increase in operating income was attributable to a million increase in revenues partially offset by a million increase in expenses 
the overall increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to million associated with the mobile business purchased in the fourth quarter of  a million increase in stock compensation expense as a result of adopting fasr in  and a million increase in our product research and development costs excluding share based compensation 
our overall financial position remains strong 
during we generated net cash from operating activities of million  and had million in cash  cash equivalents and cash investments including restricted cash at december  our net cash flows from operations were the highest yearly amount in our history 
our days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days for the quarter ended december  compared to days for the quarter ended december  the increase in days sales outstanding at december  was primarily attributable to the mobile business purchased in the fourth quarter of for a discussion of certain factors that may impact our business and financial results  see risk factors future operating results  above 
business trends overall  the it spending patterns we are witnessing supports our view that fiscally cautious customers generally are continuing to purchase products and services based more on present need and less on fulfilling anticipated future needs 
we do see  however  growing momentum in the market for extending enterprise level data to handheld devices 
we believe this development supports and validates our unwired enterprise initiative 
the market for new sales of enterprise infrastructure software primarily sold by our ipg segment continues to be challenging due to various factors including a maturing enterprise infrastructure software market and cautious information technology spending 
we have noted  however  indications of an improving pipeline for enterprise infrastructure products 
during  we continued to see momentum from the major upgrade of our flagship database  adaptive server enterprise ase  which was released in the third quarter of this resulted in a percent yearly increase in the number of new ase customers and a percent yearly increase in license revenue from our ase product in we continue to see greater customer willingness to invest resources on new data integration initiatives and analytic solutions which has contributed to yearly increases of percent in our replication server product and percent in our iq product during our replication server product delivers operational data across complex and broadly distributed heterogeneous data infrastructures in near real time to ensure continuous data availability  operational synchronization and timely reporting 
our iq product offers a highly optimized analytic engine specifically designed to deliver dramatically faster results for business intelligence  analytic and reporting solutions 

table of contents we are also very encouraged by the progress we have made with our ibm relationships 
for  our fastest growing platform was linux on the ibm p series and the growth of sybase database revenues on the ibm platform are running at approximately two times the six percent industry growth rate 
additionally  we were recently named ibm s outstanding isv innovation partner for and the joint sybase ibm business intelligence campaign was rated by ibm as their number one business campaign 
with respect to the market for mobility and integration products primarily sold by our ias segment  we believe these products are gaining market acceptance and will provide us with growth opportunities in the future 
the addition of  new customers during drove growth in the ias segment 
we did note a slowdown in the mobile middleware market during the later half of consistent with broader market trends for these products 
we believe some of the slowdown resulted from product cycle transition which in our case included shipping our onebridge  afaria and information anywhere suite products in late november or early december of we believe that entering we are beginning a strong product cycle with our refreshed ianywhere product platform that will lead to growth in the ias segment at or above market rates 
with respect to the market for messaging services sold by our sybase segment  we believe that our inter carrier messaging business will see further increases in revenue driven by continuing growth in sms and mms traffic levels and acquisition of new carriers  especially in new territories 
we also believe that enterprises  brands and content providers will focus more of their business towards mobile messaging as an inexpensive means of interacting with their customers on a real time basis 
this in turn will drive further growth in our application messaging business 
moving forward we will continue to manage our operating margin and build upon our revenue momentum as we aggressively pursue our unwired enterprise initiative and strategic alliances with our key partners 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we also are required to make certain judgments that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during each reporting period 
we periodically evaluate our estimates and assumptions including those relating to software and mobile messaging revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  the allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  income taxes  stock based compensation  purchase accounting  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances 
our management has reviewed the development  selection  and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
these estimates and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
further  changes in accounting and legal standards could adversely affect our future operating results see risk factors future operating results  above 
our critical accounting policies include software and mobile messaging revenue recognition  impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  allowance for doubtful accounts  capitalized software  income taxes  stock based compensation  purchase accounting  restructuring and contingencies and liabilities  each of which are discussed below 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue recognition rules for software and message services companies are very complex 
we follow specific and detailed guidance in measuring revenue  although certain judgments affect the application of our revenue recognition policy 
these judgments would include  for example  the determination of a customer s creditworthiness  whether two separate transactions with a customer should be accounted for as a single transaction  reporting message service revenues gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or whether included software services are essential to the functionality of a product 
license and service revenues we recognize software revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  and sop  and in certain instances in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts or sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
we license software under non cancelable license agreements 
license fee revenues are recognized when a a non cancelable license agreement is in force  b the product has been delivered  c the license fee is fixed or determinable  and d collection is reasonably assured 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized as payments become due from the customer and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
residual method accounting 
in software arrangements that include multiple elements eg  license rights and technical support services  we allocate the total fees among each of the elements using the residual method of accounting 
under this method  revenue allocated to undelivered elements is based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of such undelivered elements  and the residual revenue is allocated to the delivered elements 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for such undelivered elements is based upon the price we charge for such product or service when it is sold separately 
we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes to our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for such undelivered elements 
as a result  future revenue associated with multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results 
percentage of completion accounting 
fees from licenses sold together with consulting services are generally recognized upon shipment of the licenses  provided i the criteria described in subparagraphs a through d above are met  ii payment of the license fee is not dependent upon performance of the consulting services  and iii the consulting services are not essential to the functionality of the licensed software 
if the services are essential to the functionality of the software  or performance of services is a condition to payment of license fees  both the software license and consulting fees are recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
we use labor hours to estimate the progress to completion 
under this method  we are required to estimate the number of total hours needed to complete a project  and revenues and profits are recognized based on the percentage of total contract hours as they are completed while costs are recognized as incurred 
due to the complexity involved in the estimating process  revenues and profits recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting are subject to revision as contract phases are actually completed 
historically  these revisions have not been material 
sublicense revenues 
we recognize sublicense fees as reported to us by our licensees 
license fees for certain application development and data access tools are recognized upon direct shipment by us to the end user or upon direct shipment to the reseller for resale to the end user 
if collection is not reasonably assured in advance  revenue is recognized only when sublicense fees are actually collected and all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
service revenues 
technical support revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the related support agreement  which in most cases is one year 
revenues from consulting services under time and materials contracts  and for education  are recognized as services are performed 
revenues from other contract services are generally recognized based on the proportional performance of the project  with performance measured based on hours of work performed 

table of contents message revenues we recognize message revenue in accordance with sec sab  no 
 emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf and eitf  no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent eitf 
we recognize revenue when a there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  b the service has been provided to the customer  c the amount of the fees to be paid by the customer is fixed and determinable  and d the collection of the fees is reasonable assured 
our agreements with mobile operators and content providers to provide messaging and data delivery and settlement services generally have an initial term of one year 
we generate a significant portion of our message revenue from per message transaction fees including those under revenue share arrangements 
we deliver messages and data and primarily earn per message transaction fees 
we recognize revenue from transaction fees based upon the number of messages successfully processed by our platforms and delivered in accordance with the terms of our arrangements 
mobile operators  content providers  and other enterprises enter into revenue sharing arrangements with us 
under a typical revenue sharing model  our arrangements with mobile operator customers provide for the delivery of authorized services to their subscribers and the payment to us of either a percentage of revenue earned by the mobile operator or a fixed amount per message delivered and billed per the mobile operator s statistics 
in addition  we also have relationships with the content providers that require us to pay the content provider a percentage of the revenue received from or confirmed by the mobile operators with respect to services incorporating the content providers content 
in accordance with eitf  we have determined that we act as an agent under our revenue sharing arrangements and accordingly  record as revenue the net amount retained by us 
the net amount retained by us reflects the gross amount billed to the operator less amounts due to the content provider 
unbilled message revenues 
due to our billing cycles  which for some of our services lag as much as days after the calendar month in which the services are rendered  the amounts of unbilled revenues are estimated each reporting period 
the estimates are based on recent volume and pricing trends adjusted for material changes in contracted service  because actual information is not available immediately 
based on a retrospective review of actual billings compared to estimates  the estimates have been reasonable 
unanticipated changes in volume and pricing trends or material changes in contracted service could adversely affect our estimates of unbilled revenue 
this estimate is critical to our financial statements because it impacts revenue and accounts receivables 
as of december   our estimated unbilled receivables related to messaging revenues were million 
a change in our estimate would result in either an increase or decrease in revenues and accounts receivable of approximately million 
impairment of goodwill  non amortizable intangible assets and other purchased intangible assets goodwill and other non amortizable intangible assets  such as tradenames  have generally resulted from our business combinations accounted for as purchases 
we are required to test amounts recorded as goodwill or other non amortizable intangible assets with indeterminate lives  at least annually for impairment 
the review of goodwill and indeterminate lived intangibles for potential impairment is highly subjective and requires us to make numerous estimates  using a discounted cash flow model  to determine both the fair values and the carrying values of our reporting units to which goodwill is assigned 
for these purposes  our reporting units equate to our reported segments 
see note ten to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than its carrying value  we are required to perform an analysis similar to a purchase price allocation for an acquired business in order to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
this analysis requires a valuation of certain other purchased intangible assets with determinate and indeterminate useful lives including in process research and development  and developed technology 
we performed our annual 
table of contents impairment analysis for each of our historical operating units ipg and ias and for each indeterminate lived intangible asset as of december  this analysis indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit or indeterminate lived intangible exceeded its carrying value 
therefore  we were not required to recognize an impairment loss in we will perform the initial impairment analysis for the sybase reporting unit during as of december   our goodwill balance totaled million and our other purchased intangibles totaled million 
changes in our internal business structure  increases in the applicable discount rate  changes in our future revenue and expense forecasts  and certain other factors that directly impact the valuation of our reporting units could result in a future impairment charge 
we also continue to separately review our other intangible assets eg  purchased technology  customer lists and covenants not to compete for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
for these purposes  recoverability of these assets is measured by comparing their carrying values to the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
this methodology requires us to estimate future cash flows associated with certain assets or groups of assets 
changes in these estimates  technology obsolescence  customer terminations including message customers due to technology interoperability and other factors could result in impairment losses associated with other intangible assets 
there were no indicators of impairment during allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected non collection of accounts receivable 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses  judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers  assess current economic and industry trends that might impact the level of credit losses in the future and other factors 
our allowances have generally been adequate to cover our actual credit losses 
however  since we cannot reliably predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  we cannot guarantee that our allowance will continue to be adequate 
for example  our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled million at december  if our allowance for doubtful accounts  including identified specific customer matters  changed by our allowance for doubtful accounts and operating results would change by million 
capitalized software we capitalize certain software development costs after a product becomes technologically feasible and before its general release to customers 
our net capitalized software totaled million at december  significant judgment is required in determining when a product becomes technologically feasible 
capitalized development costs are then amortized over the product s estimated life beginning upon general release of the product 
quarterly  we compare a product s unamortized capitalized cost to the product s net realizable value 
to the extent unamortized capitalized cost exceeds net realizable value based on the product s estimated future gross revenues reduced by the estimated future costs of completing and selling the product the excess is written off 
this analysis requires us to estimate future gross revenues associated with certain products and the future costs of completing and selling certain products 
changes in these estimates could result in write offs of capitalized software costs 
see note one to consolidated financial statements  part ii  item  incorporated here by reference 
income taxes estimates of effective tax rates  deferred taxes and valuation allowance we use the asset and liability approach to account for income taxes 
this methodology recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we then record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that likely will be realized 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
if we determine in any period that we could realize a larger net deferred tax 
table of contents asset than the recorded amount  we would adjust the deferred tax asset and record a corresponding reduction to our income tax expense for the period 
conversely  if we determine that we would be unable to realize a portion of our recorded deferred tax asset  we would adjust the deferred tax asset and record a charge to income tax expense for the period 
significant judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized the our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations between the actual outcomes of these future tax consequences eg  the income we earn within the united states could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
see note eight to the consolidated financial statements income taxes  part ii  item our effective tax rate is based on expected geographic income  statutory rates and enacted tax rules  including transfer pricing 
we are required to exercise significant judgment in determining our effective rate and in evaluating various positions that apply to our worldwide operations 
we believe that our tax positions  including intercompany transfer pricing policies  are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct business 
it is possible  however  that these positions will be challenged which may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin no 
fin prescribes a recognition and measurement threshold for a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin is effective commencing with our annual financial statements 
we are evaluating the impact of fin we do not anticipate that the adoption of fin will have a material impact on the financial statements 
accounting for stock based compensation plans prior to january   we accounted for our stock based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly we were not required to record compensation expense when stock options were granted to eligible participants as long as the exercise price was not less than the fair market value of the stock when the option was granted 
prior to january   we generally recorded stock based employee compensation relating to restricted stock grants 
we recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas and sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we disclosed our pro forma net income or loss and net income or loss per share as if we had applied the fair value based method in measuring compensation expense for our stock based incentive programs 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes a period compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  adjusted for estimated forfeitures  and b period compensation expense for all stock based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
because we elected to use the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost before income tax benefit related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements granted under all equity compensation plans which we will amortize to expense in the future 
total unrecognized compensation cost will be adjusted for future changes in estimated forfeitures 
we expect to recognize that cost over a weighted average period of years 

table of contents we estimate the fair value of options granted using the black scholes option valuation model and the assumptions shown in note seven to the consolidated financial statements stockholders equity  part ii  item we estimated the expected term of options granted based on historical exercise patterns 
beginning in the second quarter of we estimated the volatility of our options and stock appreciation rights considering both the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent four year period and the prices of publicly traded options  consistent with sfas r and securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
prior to that  we estimated the volatility factors for stock options and stock appreciation rights considering the historical volatility of our stock over the most recent four year period which was approximately equal to the average expected life of our options 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the black scholes option valuation model on the average of the and year treasury rates as published by the federal reserve 
we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero in the black scholes option valuation model 
sfas r requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for purposes of calculating pro forma information under sfas for periods prior to  we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
we amortize the fair value on a ratable basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates determined under the black scholes option valuation model 
in the future  changes in the assumptions under the black scholes valuation model or our election to use a different valuation model  which could result in a significantly different impact on our net income or loss 
purchase accounting we have made estimates of the fair values of purchased intangible and other assets acquired in conjunction with our purchase of mobile  inc as of november   and other acquired companies based primarily on appraisals from third parties and certain internally generated information 
the allocation and final determination of the mobile purchase price is subject to change 
the primary areas of the purchase price and related allocation that are not finalized relate to restructuring costs  purchase price adjustments due to final working capital adjustments  certain legal matters  certain deferred tax assets and liabilities and residual goodwill 
purchased intangible assets  excluding goodwill  totaled million at december  if the subsequent actual and updated projections of the underlying business activity change as compared to the underlying assumptions and projections used to develop these values  then we could experience impairment losses  as described above 
in addition  we have estimated the economic lives of certain of these assets and these lives were used to calculate depreciation and amortization expense 
if our estimates of the economic lives change  then additional depreciation or amortization expense could be incurred on an annual basis 
historically  we have not made any changes in these areas 
if the estimates of the economic lives of the definite lived intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of mobile were reduced by one year  our amortization expense would increase by approximately million 

table of contents restructuring we have recorded significant accruals in connection with various restructuring activities 
our remaining restructuring accruals primarily relate to the estimated net costs to settle certain lease obligations based on analysis of independent real estate consultants 
while we do not anticipate significant changes to these estimates in the future  the actual costs may differ from estimates 
for example  if we are able to negotiate more affordable termination fees  if rental rates increase in the markets where the properties are located  or if we are able to locate suitable sublease tenants more quickly than expected  the actual costs could be lower than our estimates 
in that case  we would reduce our restructuring accrual with a corresponding credit to cost of restructuring or goodwill 
alternatively  if we are unable to negotiate affordable termination fees  if rental rates decrease in the markets where the properties are located  or if it takes us longer than expected to find suitable sublease tenants  the actual costs could exceed our estimates see note thirteen to consolidated financial statements restructuring costs  part ii  item contingencies and liabilities we are involved from time to time in various proceedings  lawsuits and claims involving our customers  products  intellectual property  stockholders and employees  among other parties 
we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
when we reasonably determine that a loss associated with any of these matters is probable  and can reasonably estimate the loss  we record a reserve to provide for such loss contingencies 
if we are unable to record a reserve because we are not able to estimate the amount of a potential loss in a matter  or if we determine that a loss is not probable  we are nevertheless required to disclose certain information regarding such matter if we determine that there is a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
because of the inherent uncertainties related to these types of matters  we base our loss reserves on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we may reevaluate our assessment regarding the probability of a matter or its expected loss 
our financial position  results of operations or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by such revisions in our estimates 
for further discussion of contingencies and liabilities  see risk factors future operating results  above 
we currently believe that the ultimate liability  if any  for any pending claims of any type either alone or combined will not materially affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we also believe that we would be able to obtain any necessary licenses or other rights to disputed intellectual property rights on commercially reasonable terms 
however  the ultimate outcome of any litigation is uncertain and  regardless of outcome  litigation can have an adverse impact on sybase because of defense costs  negative publicity  diversion of management resources and other factors 
our inability to obtain necessary license or other legal rights  or litigation arising out of intellectual property claims could adversely affect our business

we believe the introduction of the ias mobility suite will continue to drive growth in the increase in ipg license fees was primarily attributable to a percent increase in our adaptive server enterprise product and a percent increase from our replication server product 
we believe the growth in our adaptive server enterprise product was partially the result of the introduction of adaptive server enterprise in the third quarter of as well as strong demand for heterogeneous data integration  management  and analytics projects 
the increase in ipg license fees during was primarily attributable to increases in license revenues associated with our sybase iq and adaptive server products 
we further believe that the increasing acceptance of our replication server product and the introduction of the data integration suite will drive future revenue growth 
segment license and service revenues include transactions between ias and ipg  the most common instance relates to the sale of ias products and services to third parties by ipg 
in the case of such a transaction  ipg records the revenue on the sale with a corresponding inter company expense on the transaction 
ias then records intercompany revenue and continues to bear the costs of providing the product or service 
the excess of revenues over inter company expense recognized by ipg is intended to reflect the costs incurred by ipg to complete the sales transaction 
total transactions between the segments ie  intercompany revenue and inter company expense are offset in eliminations
