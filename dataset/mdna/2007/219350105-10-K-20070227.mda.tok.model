item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our key priorities for remained unchanged from the previous two years protect our financial health  improve our profitability  and invest in the future 
we made significant progress on all three in financial health in  our balance sheet remained strong and we delivered positive cash flows from operating activities 
significant activities in included the following we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes due for general corporate purposes and in support of an objective to extend the timing of future debt maturities 
we reduced our long term debt in the following transactions we redeemed million of our euro notes  due in we repurchased million of our notes due in  and we redeemed million of our medium term notes due in we received million in deposits against orders relating to our multi year supply agreements with customers in the display technologies segment 
these agreements have helped us to meet the rapid growth of the lcd market 
all three of our rating agencies upgraded our ratings to either bbb or baa we generated cash flows from operating activities in excess of our capital expenditures 
we ended with billion in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this represents an increase of million from december  in november  we amended our revolving credit facility so that it now provides us access to a billion unsecured multi currency revolving line of credit through march we believe we have sufficient liquidity for the next several years to fund operations  capital expenditures and scheduled debt repayments 
profitability for the year ended december   we generated net income of  million or per share compared to net income of million or per share for we recorded restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits in the past three years which affect the comparability of those years 
refer to note restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits  note income taxes  and note investments to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
investing in our future we remain committed to investing in research  development  and engineering to drive innovation 
we are investing in a wide variety of technologies with a focus on glass substrates for active matrix lcds  diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards  and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber to the premises 
our research  development and engineering expenditures have increased by million or compared to we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our growth strategies 
we also remain committed to investing in manufacturing capacity to match increased demand in our businesses 
our capital expenditures are primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity for lcd glass substrates in the display technologies segment and diesel products in the environmental technologies segment 
total capital expenditures for were  million  of which million was directed toward our display technologies segment and million was invested in our environmental technologies segment primarily in anticipation of the emerging market for diesel emission control systems 
we expect our capital spending to be in the range of billion to billion  of which approximately million will be directed toward our display technologies segment and approximately million will be directed toward our environmental technologies segment

gross margin as a percentage of net sales  gross margin was up slightly from driven primarily by our display technologies segment 
gross margins for this segment were essentially even with reflecting the negative impact of price declines offset by higher volumes and cost reductions 
display technologies segment sales increased from of total corning s sales in to of corning s sales in as display technologies has a higher gross margin than our consolidated gross margin  the added concentration in display technologies in caused corning s gross margin percentage to increase from in to in for  as a percentage of net sales  gross margin improved percentage points versus the improvement was driven by increased volume  improved mix of large generation glass and manufacturing efficiencies in our display technologies segment 
selling  general  and administrative expenses the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to  in dollars  was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense as a result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits corning recorded significant net charges in which affect the comparability of our results for   and a summary of the net charges and credits for all years presented is provided in the following table in millions for the years ended december  impairment of goodwill  impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment assets to be held and used reversal of currency translation adjustment accelerated depreciation loss on sale of businesses impairment of available for sale securities restructuring charges and credits total restructuring  impairment other charges and credits impairment of goodwill impairment charge pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level 
in addition  goodwill should be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its related carrying value 
in the third quarter of  we identified certain factors that caused us to lower our estimates and projections for the long term revenue growth of the telecommunications segment  which indicated that the fair value of the telecommunications segment reporting unit was less than its carrying value 
we performed an interim impairment test of the telecommunications segment goodwill in the third quarter of and  as a result  recorded an impairment charge of  million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill to its implied fair value at september  of million 
impairment of long lived assets other than goodwill given our restructuring actions and the market conditions facing certain of our businesses  at various times throughout to  we performed evaluations of the recoverability of our held for use long lived assets other than goodwill 
when an impairment evaluation was required  we developed expected future cash flows against which to compare the carrying value of the asset group being evaluated 
if our projections indicated that our long lived assets were not recoverable through future cash flows  we were then required to estimate the fair value of the long lived assets  limited to property  plant and equipment  using the expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value 
impairment charge assets to be held and used in  we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of million to impair certain long lived assets of our telecommunications segment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
due to our lowered long term outlook for this business  we determined that an event of impairment  as defined by sfas  had occurred in that business  which further required us to test this asset group for impairment 
we assess recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we estimated the fair value of the long lived assets for this business using a discounted expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value 
as a result of our impairment evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge to write down the asset group to its estimated fair value 
impairment charge assets to be disposed of by sale or abandonment these charges comprise the following telecommunications segment in  we recorded a net charge of million to impair plant and equipment related to certain facilities to be disposed of or shutdown 
approximately million of this net charge was comprised of the partially completed sections of our concord  nc optical fiber facility 
as a result of our lowered outlook  we have permanently abandoned this construction in progress as we no longer believe the demand for optical fiber will warrant the investment necessary to complete this facility 
we have mothballed and will continue to depreciate the separate previously operated portion of the concord fiber facility 
other businesses we recorded net credits of million  primarily for gains on the sale of assets corning asahi video products cav sold to a third party in china 
this represented proceeds in excess of assumed salvage values for assets previously impaired 
this represented the substantial completion of the sale of cav s assets 
assets to be held and used in  due to our decision to permanently abandon certain assets and lower our long term outlook for the telecommunications segment in  we determined that an event of impairment had occurred in our telecommunications segment which required us to test the segment s long lived assets other than goodwill for impairment 
as a result of this impairment evaluation  we recorded a million impairment charge in the third quarter of to write down certain assets to fair value 
other credits reversal of currency translation adjustment in  corning sold its photonic business operations to avanex 
the photonics business was the sole operation of corning oti oti oti  a wholly owned italian subsidiary of corning  whose results were included in corning s telecommunications segment 
subsequent to the sale of the operating assets of oti to avanex  corning began liquidating oti 
in october  the assets of oti were determined to be substantially liquidated 
as a result of the substantial liquidation  oti s cumulative translation account was reversed  resulting in a gain of million in the fourth quarter 
accelerated depreciation accelerated depreciation we recorded million of accelerated depreciation relating to the final shutdown of our semiconductor materials manufacturing facility in charleston  south carolina  which we announced in the fourth quarter of loss on sale of businesses loss on sale of business on september  we completed the sale of our frequency controls business  which was part of the telecommunications segment  for net cash proceeds of million 
we recorded a loss on the sale of million  which included an allocation of million of the telecommunications segment goodwill 
impairment of available for sale securities impairment charge in  we recorded impairment charges of million for an other than temporary decline in the fair value of our investment in avanex corporation avanex below its adjusted cost basis 
our investment in avanex was accounted for as an available for sale security under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
in the fourth quarter of  we completed the sale of our shares of avanex 
restructuring actions restructuring actions corning recorded net restructuring charges of million in which included the following a charge of million comprising severance costs for a restructuring plan in the telecommunications segment to continue to reduce costs in this segment 
net credits to prior year restructuring plans totaling million primarily for revisions to plans related to the shutdown of corning asahi video products and to our specialty materials business 
legal settlement asbestos on march   we announced that we had reached agreement with the representatives of current and future asbestos claimants on a settlement arrangement that was thereafter incorporated into the pittsburgh corning corporation pcc plan of reorganization the pcc plan 
this settlement remains subject to a number of contingencies  including approval by the bankruptcy court 
if the pcc plan is approved and becomes effective  our settlement will require corning to relinquish its equity interest in pcc  contribute its equity interest in pittsburgh corning europe nv pce  and contribute million shares of corning common stock 
the common stock and other components of the settlement will be marked to market each quarter until the pcc plan is approved  thus resulting in adjustments to income and the settlement liability as appropriate 
corning will also make cash payments of million net present value of million at march in six installments beginning one year after the plan is effective 
in addition  we will assign insurance policy proceeds from our primary insurance and a portion of our excess insurance as part of the settlement 
two of corning s primary insurers and several excess insurers have commenced litigation for a declaration of the rights and obligations of the parties under insurance policies  including rights that may be affected by the settlement arrangement described above 
corning is vigorously contesting these cases 
management is unable to predict the outcome of this insurance litigation 
the pcc plan received a favorable vote from creditors in march hearings to consider objections to the pcc plan were held in the bankruptcy court in may in february  the bankruptcy court requested that the pcc plan proponents delete references to section a of the bankruptcy code and resubmit the pcc plan 
the final round of oral argument was held on july  on december   the bankruptcy court issued an order denying confirmation of the pcc plan for reasons set out in a memorandum opinion 
several parties  including corning  have filed motions for reconsideration  which are scheduled for a hearing before the bankruptcy court on march  if the bankruptcy court does not approve the pcc plan in its current form  changes to the pcc plan are probable as it is likely that the court will allow the proponents time to propose amendments 
the outcome of these proceedings is uncertain  and confirmation of the current plan or any amended plan is subject to a number of contingencies 
however  apart from the quarterly mark to market adjustment in the value of the million shares of corning stock  management believes that the likelihood of a material adverse impact to corning s financial statements is remote 
the following summarizes the charges and gains we have recorded for the asbestos settlement in millions for the years ended december  initial settlement charge fair market value adjustment for other components mark to market common stock asbestos settlement see legal proceedings for additional information about this matter 
income loss from continuing operations before income taxes in addition to the items identified under gross margin  restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits and asbestos settlement  we retired a significant amount of our outstanding debentures during  and  that resulted in losses of million  million  and million  respectively 
movements in currency exchange rates negatively impacted income loss from continuing operations in and when compared to the respective previous years 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax benefit rates were as follows in millions for the years ended december  provision for income taxes  effective income tax rate the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items the impact of not recording tax expense on income generated in the us  the release of valuation allowances on all australian deferred tax assets and on a portion of our deferred tax assets in germany  and the benefit of tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions 
in and we recorded valuation allowances against our entire us deferred tax assets because we incurred significant losses in the us in recent years 
as a result  our tax provision in these years has included only the net tax expense attributable to certain foreign operations 
while we did generate income from continuing operations in the us in  such income was largely offset by tax adjustments not reflected in our continuing operations 
in the absence of an appropriate level of overall profitability in the us  we did not record tax expense on income from continuing operations in the us in  resulting in a reduction in our effective tax rate of 
in  we also recorded valuation allowances against most of our foreign deferred tax assets 
in  due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections in both australia and at certain of our german operations  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that the underlying tax benefits are realizable and released valuation allowances  resulting in a reduction in our effective tax rate of 
certain foreign subsidiaries in china  south africa and taiwan are operating under tax holiday arrangements 
the nature and extent of such arrangements vary  and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in years to according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions 
the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of   and for   and  respectively 
in addition to the aforementioned benefit of tax holidays  the effective income tax rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to tax expense of million to increase corning s valuation allowance 
differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to establishing a valuation allowance against certain domestic us federal  state and local and foreign deferred tax assets  and the write off of nondeductible goodwill 
in  significant events occurred which required us to increase our valuation allowances against certain us and german deferred tax assets resulting in an increase in our effective tax rate of 
refer to note restructuring  impairment and other charges and credits for additional information on these events and the related charges 
at that time  we believed that it was more likely than not that we could realize the remaining net us deferred tax assets of approximately million through a tax planning strategy involving the sale of our investment in dow corning  a non strategic appreciated asset  if we were faced with expiring net operating loss carryforwards 
during  dow corning s performance was much stronger than expected and dow corning resumed paying a dividend  both of which are expected to continue in the future 
due to this improved performance  we concluded that dow corning provides strong financial  geographic and market balance to corning s portfolio of businesses  the profitability of which has become more concentrated due to the success of the display operating segment 
as a result  we considered dow corning to be a strategic investment and could no longer assert that a potential tax planning strategy involving the sale of dow corning would be prudent  as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
therefore  we no longer believed  in the fourth quarter of  that it was more likely than not that we would realize the remaining net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  we increased our valuation allowance by million to fully reserve our net us deferred tax assets in the fourth quarter of  which increased our effective tax rate by during the third quarter of  corning filed its consolidated us federal income tax return  which included a billion worthless stock deduction for the loss on our investment in the photonic technologies business associated with the pirelli acquisition 
this acquisition was completed in december and was substantially impaired in the second quarter of prior to the third quarter of  we did not record a deferred tax asset for this item as the ultimate realization of such deduction was uncertain  and consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  recognition of an asset prior to the time management determines the realization of the asset is probable is prohibited 
on september   corning and the commissioner of the irs entered into a closing agreement under section of the internal revenue code of which provides that corning is entitled to this worthless stock deduction 
we recorded a billion deferred tax asset for this item in the third quarter  which was concurrently offset by a valuation allowance of an equal amount due to our inability to record tax benefits for us net operating losses 
the net result had no impact of our effective tax rate for equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments in millions samsung corning precision dow corning samsung corning all other total equity earnings the and increases in equity earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments  are primarily due to strong sales and earnings performance at samsung corning precision and at dow corning 
in addition to the above  equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments  included the following restructuring and impairment charges and other credits in  dow corning reached settlement with the irs regarding liabilities for tax years to equity earnings reflected a million gain as a result of the settlement which resolved all federal tax issues related to dow corning s implant settlement 
in  samsung corning recorded the following items which increased corning s equity earnings by million  net a gain on the sale of land which increased corning s equity earnings by million  an impairment charge on certain long lived assets which reduced corning s equity earnings by million  and the establishment of a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets which reduced corning s equity earnings by million 
in  samsung corning incurred impairment and other charges as a result of a decline in the projected operating results for its cathode ray tube crt glass business 
the charge  which included certain manufacturing assets and severance and exit costs  reduced corning s equity earnings by million in the third quarter 
in  dow corning recorded a gain on the issuance of subsidiary stock 
corning s equity earnings included million related to this gain 
in  corning incurred charges of million to impaire quity method investments in the telecommunications segment to their estimated fair value 
in  dow corning recorded charges related to restructuring actions and adjustments to interest liabilities recorded on its emergence from bankruptcy 
corning s equity earnings included million related to these charges 
in   and  samsung corning recorded significant fixed asset and other impairment charges 
as the conventional television glass market will be negatively impacted by strong growth in the lcd glass market  it is reasonably possible that samsung corning may incur additional restructuring or impairment charges or operating losses in the foreseeable future 
samsung corning is currently investing in several developing businesses which samsung corning management believes will offset the decline in conventional television glass market over time 
should these new businesses not achieve expected results  additional operating losses  asset impairments and restructuring charges are likely to occur and samsung corning s long term financial viability may come into question 
these events could result in corning incurring an impairment of its investment in samsung corning 
corning management believes it is more likely than not that an impairment of our investment will occur in the foreseeable future 
corning s investment in samsung corning was million at december  income loss from continuing operations as a result of the items discussed above  the income loss from continuing operations and per share data was as follows in millions  except per share amounts for the years ended december  income loss from continuing operations  basic earnings loss per common share from continuing operations diluted earnings loss per common share from continuing operations shares used in computing basic per share amounts   shares used in computing diluted per share amounts  results of discontinued operations in the third quarter of  corning and m reached a final settlement agreement for funds held in escrow associated with the sale of corning s precision lens business to m 
as a result  we recognized a million gain upon receipt of the proceeds in operating segments our reportable operating segments include display technologies  telecommunications  environmental technologies  and life sciences 
the environmental technologies reportable segment is an aggregation of our automotive and diesel operating segments  as these two segments share similar economic characteristics  products  customer types  production processes and distribution methods 
the following provides a brief description of the products and markets served by each reportable segment display technologies manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays  telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable  and hardware and equipment components for the worldwide telecommunications industry  environmental technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automobile and diesel applications  and life sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications 
we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions 
we include the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment s net income 
we have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
these expenses include interest  taxes and corporate functions 
segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 
the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements 
on january   corning changed its measurement of segment profit or loss as follows we removed the net impact of financing costs  such as interest expense on debt instruments and interest costs associated with benefit plans  from reportable segments and included these amounts in corporate unallocated expense 
we changed the allocation method for taxes to more closely reflect the company s current tax position 
we removed the impact of non cash stock compensation expense from reportable segments and included this amount in corporate unallocated expense 
we removed the allocation of exploratory research  development and engineering expense from reportable segments and included these amounts in corporate unallocated expense 
we changed certain other allocation methods for corporate functions 
the following discussion reflects segment information that has been revised to reflect the changes to segment performance measurement as described above 
display technologies the following table provides net sales and other data for the display technologies segment dollars in millions change vs 
vs 
net sales    income before equity earnings  equity earnings of affiliated companies net income   vs 
the net sales increase for continues to reflect overall lcd glass market growth 
during  glass substrate volumes measured in square feet of glass sold increased compared with  driven by increased lcd monitor and tv market penetration  demand for larger size substrates generation and above  and continued strong demand for glass for notebook computers 
sales of large size glass substrates  which carry a slightly higher selling price per square foot  accounted for of sales volumes compared to in the growth in volume was partially offset by declines in weighted average selling prices of approximately 
sales of the display technologies segment are denominated primarily in the japanese yen 
movements in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate negatively impacted sales by approximately million or when compared with in the second quarter of  the display technologies segment reported its first quarterly sequential decline in volume since the third quarter of the lower volume was the result of a number of our customers  primarily in taiwan  idling part of their facilities and thus reducing their demand for glass  as a result of a build up of panel inventory in the supply chain 
in comparison to the second quarter of  both volume and sales increased in the third quarter of as expected  our customers reduced their inventories and began ramping up lcd panel production to meet seasonally stronger demand expected in the fourth quarter 
for  the increase in income before equity earnings was primarily the result of higher volumes as described above and manufacturing cost reductions  offset somewhat by lower prices and the impact of exchange rates 
movements in currency exchange rates negatively impacted income before equity earnings by approximately when compared with the increase in our equity earnings  primarily from samsung corning precision  was largely driven by the same market factors identified for our wholly owned business except that the impact of the panel maker inventory build in korea in the second quarter of was not as significant 
in  samsung corning precision s earnings were negatively impacted by approximately from movements in exchange rates compared to equity earnings from samsung corning precision are susceptible to movements in the us dollar japanese yen and us dollar korean won exchange rates 
the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan and taiwan 
on october   au optronics corporation auo  a customer of the display technologies segment  completed its previously announced merger with quanta display inc qdi  another customer of corning s display technologies segment 
in addition  through two subsequent transactions  auo now holds a equity stake in toppan cfi  a subsidiary of toppan printing co  ltd  also a customer of the display technologies segment 
as a result of these transactions  auo  qdi  and toppan cfi are considered to be a single customer reported as auo 
for  auo including qdi and toppan cfi  chi mei optoelectronics corporation  and sharp corporation  which individually accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for of total segment sales when combined 
in addition  samsung corning precision s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers 
in  sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea  samsung electronics co  ltd 
and lg phillips lcd co  ltd 
accounted for approximately of total samsung corning precision sales 
in and  corning and several customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which the display technologies segment agreed to supply large size glass substrates to the customers over periods of up to six years 
as part of the agreements  these customers agreed to make advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased 
in  corning received million of customer deposits and issued million in credit memoranda 
refer to note other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
in the event the customers do not make all customer deposit installment payments or elect not to purchase the agreed upon quantities of product  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits 
if corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may be required to return certain amounts of the customer deposits 
in the ordinary course of business  corning will continue to negotiate multi year supply agreements with its large customers where feasible but we believe it is unlikely that we will negotiate agreements that require additional deposits 
corning is investing heavily to expand capacity to meet increasing demand for lcd glass substrates 
in  capital spending was million and is expected to be approximately million in capital spending in will be used primarily to expand manufacturing facilities in taichung  taiwan and shizuoka  japan 
vs 
the sales increase reflected the overall growth of the lcd glass substrate market 
during  glass substrate volumes increased approximately compared with for  large size glass substrates accounted for of total sales volumes  compared to in movements in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales 
for  the key drivers for the increase in income before equity earnings were higher volumes  ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies  and a lower effective tax rate 
movements in currency exchange rates did not have a significant impact on income before equity earnings 
the increase in our equity earnings from samsung corning precision was largely driven by higher volumes and ongoing improvements in manufacturing efficiencies 
outlook we expect to see a continuation of the overall industry growth and the trend toward large size substrates driven by increased end market demand for lcd televisions 
we anticipate the volume growth in the lcd glass market to be in the mid range in the expected market volume growth  measured in square feet  for the year should be equal to or greater than the volume growth in the market in corning s lcd glass volume is expected to grow at the upper end of this range  while samsung corning precision s volume growth may be slightly lower 
growth rates by region for the industry generally  and thus for corning s wholly owned business and samsung corning precision  may be different based on market dynamics 
we believe prices will decline in but not to the extent that we experienced in we also expect to be able to reduce our manufacturing costs to address the impact of price declines 
we expect price declines of in the first quarter of when compared to the fourth quarter of as glass for lcd television becomes a higher percentage of total lcd glass demand  we anticipate that our business will become more seasonal 
we currently anticipate that glass volume will decline in the first quarter from the seasonally strong fourth quarter of and that sales and earnings in this segment will be more concentrated in the second half of than in prior years 
although we believe that end market demand for lcd televisions  monitors and notebooks remains strong  we are cautious about the potential negative impact that economic conditions and political tensions could have on consumer demand 
there is no assurance that the end market rates of growth will continue at the rates experienced in recent years  that we will be able to pace our capacity expansions to actual demand  or that the rate of cost declines will offset price declines in any given period 
while the industry has grown rapidly  consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes  prices  or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth 
therefore  it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time 
in addition  changes in foreign exchange rates  principally the japanese yen  will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment 
telecommunications the following table provides net sales and other data for the telecommunications segment dollars in millions change vs 
vs 
net sales optical fiber and cable hardware and equipment total net sales    net income loss  vs 
increases in telecommunications segment net sales were driven by improved sales in north america  europe and china 
the increase was driven by a broader recovery in the telecommunications industry  including greater deployment of fiber to the premises products and growth in the private network market 
the volume increase was offset somewhat by continued price declines when compared to movements in foreign exchange rates which can affect this segment s net sales  primarily the euro and japanese yen  did not have a significant impact on sales in when compared to the previous year 
effective april   acs  an equity company affiliate  assumed responsibility for optical cable and hardware and equipment sales in japan 
as a result  sales in were negatively impacted as acs  which is accounted for under the equity method  began to sell into the japanese market 
sales of optical cable and hardware and equipment in japan  which are now recorded by an equity affiliate  were million in and million in the first quarter of in  we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of million to impair certain long lived assets of our cabling business in accordance with sfas due to our lowered long term outlook for this business  we determined that an event of impairment  as defined by sfas  had occurred  which further required us to test this asset group for impairment 
we assess recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we estimated the fair value of the long lived assets for this business using the expected cash flows discounted cash flow approach as a measure of fair value associated with these assets 
as a result of our impairment evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge to write down the asset group to its estimated fair value 
for the telecommunications segment  net income in and was impacted by restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits 
in  we recorded an after tax impairment charge of million  described above 
in  we recorded net after tax credits of million 
refer to results of continuing operations for a discussion of these charges 
the decline in net income for this segment in when compared to was primarily the result of the impairment charge described above and the absence of net after tax credits of million that were recorded in movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact the results for this operating segment 
the telecommunications segment has a concentrated customer base 
in  two customers of the telecommunications segment  which individually accounted for more than of total segment net sales  accounted for of total segment sales when combined

results for the telecommunications segment reflected a solid performance in the net sales increase was largely driven by sales in north america and europe 
excluding the impact of the frequency controls business  a hardware and equipment manufacturer sold in september  net sales for the telecommunications segment increased in when compared to the previous year 
movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact sales for either or for the telecommunications segment  net income in and the net loss in were impacted by restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits 
in  we recorded net after tax credits of million related to these items and in  we recorded after tax charges of  million 
refer to results of continuing operations for a detailed discussion of these charges 
outlook for the telecommunications segment  we expect sales and earnings to increase in  reflecting a broader based increase in demand than in the last two years 
however  sales will still be impacted by the seasonal buying patterns of our largest customer 
changes in our customer s expected deployment plan  or additional reductions in their inventory levels of fiber to the premises products  could also affect the sales level 
should these plans not occur at the pace anticipated  our sales and earnings would be adversely affected 
environmental technologies the following table provides net sales and other data for the environmental technologies segment dollars in millions change vs 
vs 
net sales automotive diesel total net sales net income vs 
sales of this segment in were somewhat higher than last year due to improvements in diesel products sales  primarily for light duty diesel vehicle applications 
however  we also experienced a decline in automotive product sales due to lower volumes 
as end customers shift demand toward smaller  more energy efficient vehicles  demand for larger automobiles has declined 
this shift in demand has caused our automotive substrate volumes to decline because our market share is relatively higher for manufacturers of larger vehicles 
in addition  volumes have been negatively impacted because smaller vehicles require proportionately smaller substrates 
movements in exchange rates did not have a significant impact on sales for this segment 
the decrease in net income in versus was due primarily to increased research  development  and engineering spending in preparation for the growth in sales of heavy duty and light duty diesel products 
vs 
the increase in net sales was the result of continued growth in diesel products sales 
for automotive products  sales in were flat when compared to prior year 
the decrease in net income compared to resulted primarily from increased operating expenses primarily to support our emerging diesel products 
movements in exchange rates did not significantly impact net sales or net income of this segment in when compared to the environmental technologies segment sells to a concentrated customer base of manufacturers of catalyzers and emission control systems  who then sell to automotive and diesel engine manufacturers 
although our sales are to the emission control systems manufacturers  the use of substrates and filters is generally required by the specifications of the automotive and diesel engine manufacturers 
in  three customers of the environmental technologies segment  which individually accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for of total segment sales 
outlook we expect both sales and earnings improvements in the environmental technologies segment in automotive substrate sales are expected to remain even with levels 
diesel products sales are expected to increase more than in as regulations that require heavy duty diesel filters such as ours to meet tighter emission standards became effective in the us on january  segment profitability is expected to increase due to higher diesel volumes and manufacturing cost reductions 
changes in automotive production could adversely impact sales and net income of this segment

net sales net loss income vs 
net sales of the life sciences segment were up slightly in when compared to due to increased prices offset by volume declines in the us movements in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of sales 
the segment continues to operate at a loss due to significant research  development  and engineering spending related to the epic system  a high throughput label free screening platform based on optical biosensor technology  which had its market launch in the segment loss also includes million of severance  curtailment  and asset impairment costs related to the shutdown of a facility in the united kingdom 
in the life sciences segment  one customer accounted for approximately of this segment s net sales in vs 
the decrease in net sales in when compared to was due to volume decreases as a result of a change in our distribution channel that was made in early prior to  approximately of the life sciences segment sales were to two distributors  who in turn sold to end users such as pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  government entities  academic institutions and other research facilities 
as a result of a change in business strategy by one of the distributors  corning did not renew the distribution agreement 
approximately of life sciences sales were made through this distributor 
as expected  the change had a negative impact on sales volumes in the net loss in was due to lower sales and higher operating expenses to implement the change in distribution channels and to support new product development efforts 
movement in foreign exchange rates did not have a significant impact on the comparability of this segment s net sales or net income for and outlook sales for are expected to increase slightly over we expect a lower net loss for as a result of higher sales and the absence of severance and curtailment charges

off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
corning s off balance sheet arrangements include the following guarantee contracts that require applying the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  and variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities 
fin requires a company  at the time a guarantee is issued  to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes 
in the normal course of our business  we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees 
generally  third party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees  including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones 
these guarantees have various terms  and none of these guarantees are individually significant 
refer to note commitments  contingencies  and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
 revised fin r 
the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning 
for variable interest entities  we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by fin r 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity s net assets excluding variable interests 
corning is the primary beneficiary of one of the three entities  and as required by fin r the financial statements of the entity are included in corning s consolidated financial statements 
corning is not the primary beneficiary of two of the three variable interest entities and as such  fin r does not require corning to include them in it s consolidated financial statements 
refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
corning does not have retained interest in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity 
in the reporting year and prior to adopting sfas r  corning had employee compensation awards stock options that were excluded from the balance sheet 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  requires all derivative instruments to be recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value 
paragraph a of sfas no 
provides an exception to this requirement for contracts that are indexed to an entity s own stock and classified in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  prior to adopting sfas r  employee stock option awards were excluded from the balance sheet because they met the paragraph a criteria 
in  those options are recorded in the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
in and in the first quarter of  we had other non employee contracts that did not meet the criteria in paragraph a 
those contracts were considered derivative instruments and were accounted for as such in the respective reporting periods

capital expenditure obligations  primarily related to our display technologies segment expansions  are included on our balance sheet 
at december    million was included on our balance sheet 
amounts above are stated at their maturity value 
the estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity expiration of the related debt  based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments 
we have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates 
we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning as noted above and discussed in note investments and note commitments  contingencies  and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements 
the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan 
we believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 
pensions we have a number of defined benefit pension plans covering certain domestic and international employees 
our largest single pension plan is corning s us qualified plan 
at december   this plan accounted for of our consolidated defined benefit pension plans projected benefit obligation and of the related plans assets 
at december   the accumulated benefit obligation abo for our domestic qualified and non qualified plans and several international plans exceeded the fair value of related plan assets  requiring corning to record an additional minimum pension liability in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas 
however  in  due primarily to contributions of corning stock to the domestic qualified pension plan  the fair value of this plan s assets at december  exceeded the abo and  accordingly  corning eliminated this plan s minimum pension liability 
at december   corning adopted sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas 
sfas requires employers to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in accumulated other comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur 
the impact of adopting sfas resulted in a reduction to stockholders equity of million after tax 
dow corning s adoption of this standard resulted in a reduction to our investment in dow corning and a decrease to stockholders equity of million after tax 
refer to note employee retirement plans to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
we have traditionally contributed to the us qualified pension plan on an annual basis in excess of the irs minimum requirements  and as a result  mandatory contributions are not expected to be required for this plan until at least for  we did not make any contributions to our pension plans 
for  we issued and contributed million shares of corning common stock with a value of approximately million to our domestic pension plan 
we anticipate making voluntary cash contributions of approximately million to our domestic and international pension plans in environment we have been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by such agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
at december  and  we had accrued approximately million undiscounted and million undiscounted  respectively  for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation 
based upon the information developed to date  we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates  including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates  that required us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments follow 
impairment of goodwill sfas requires us to make certain difficult  subjective  and complex judgments on a number of matters  including assumptions and estimates used to determine the fair value of our reporting units 
our annual goodwill recoverability assessment is completed in the fourth quarter  as it is traditionally based on our annual strategic planning process that runs from june to october 
this process includes reviewing expectations for the long term growth of our businesses and forecasting future cash flows 
we measure fair value on the basis of discounted expected future cash flows 
our estimates are based upon our historical experience  our current knowledge from our commercial relationships  and available external information about future trends 
telecommunications results for the telecommunications segment in were moderate  as pricing in the telecommunications industry continues to decline 
we expect the worldwide telecommunications industry market to remain stable  fiber volumes to increase modestly  and pricing pressures to continue 
the results of our impairment tests in indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value 
a discount rate of was used in both to our conclusion would not have changed had we used a discount rate of or 
specialty materials the results of our impairment tests in indicated that the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its book value 
a discount rate of was used in and was used in we determined a range of discount rates between and would not have affected our conclusion 
impairment of assets held for use sfas requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
in certain circumstances  we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
once it has been determined that an impairment has occurred  an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used 
this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 
restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requires us to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized 
we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including  for example  employee termination costs 
restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses  of portions thereof  their profitability  cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome 
the judgment involved can be difficult  subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 
restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which  as a result  require impairment in accordance with sfas sfas requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 
during  we recorded write downs of property  plant and equipment as a result of decisions to exit facilities  primarily in the telecommunications segment 
assets impaired were primarily equipment  construction in progress and buildings  which were sold or abandoned 
we used information available from recent auctions of telecommunications equipment to estimate salvage value when measuring impairment 
the estimated salvage values were very low  primarily due to the depressed market for telecommunications related equipment 
the salvage values of property impaired were also estimated to be minimal as certain facilities will be abandoned and not sold 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to reserves 
valuation allowances for deferred income taxes sfas  accounting for income taxes requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies 
these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results and the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 
if we sustain an appropriate level of profitability  primarily in the us and germany  or if we are able to develop tax planning strategies  adjustments to current allowances will be required and may affect future net income 
refer to note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements 
probability of litigation outcomes sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter  case law  and other case specific issues 
see legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face 
the most significant matter involving judgment is the pcc asbestos liability 
there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter filing  our history of success in defending asbestos claims  our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses  our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives 
we have reached a tentative plan of settlement on pcc as disclosed in legal proceedings and note investments to the consolidated financial statements 
the settlement is subject to a number of contingencies  including approval by the bankruptcy court and resolution of any appeals 
on december   the bankruptcy court denied confirmation of the pcc plan of reorganization due to the scope of the channeling injunction proposed of the two shareholders with respect to other asbestos claims not deriving directly from pcc s products or operations 
several parties  including corning  have moved for reconsideration of the ruling 
we continue to exercise judgment in assessing the likelihood that reconsideration will lead to a revised ruling  or that an alternative plan of reorganization will emerge to address the claim deriving from pcc 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 
other possible liabilities sfas and other similarly focused accounting literature require us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters  including certain tax planning matters and environmental matters  these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  interest cost  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was  million 
the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans effect on effect on december  change in assumption pre tax pension expense pbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning s funding requirements 
in addition  at december   a basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by million before tax  a basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by million 
in addition  the impact of greater than a basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first basis point decrease in the discount rate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning s us opeb plans effect on effect on pre tax opeb december  change in assumption expense apbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
revenue recognition in certain instances  revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns  allowances  discounts  and other factors 
these estimates are supported by historical data 
while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning s future results 
stock compensation stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include risk free discount rates  expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted  volatility of stock and option prices  expected time between grant date and date of exercise  attrition  performance  and other factors 
these assumptions require us to exercise judgment 
our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience and currently available market place data 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s future stock based compensation expense and disclosures 
new accounting standards refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financials statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to exchange rates have the following effects exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings  and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar  which impact our net equity 
our most significant foreign currency exposure is the japanese yen and to a much lesser extent the korean won  the taiwan dollar  and the euro 
we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and  as such  are referred to as undesignated hedges 
changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges  along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities  are recorded in current period earnings in the other income  net component in the consolidated statement of operations 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments was million in and million in with foreign based affiliates comprising over of this amount in equity earnings from samsung corning and samsung corning precision totaled million for and million for exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had open forward contracts  open option contracts  and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements  all of which were designated as hedges at december  a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million 
specific to the japanese yen  a adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million 
as we derive approximately of our net sales from outside the us  our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies  most notably the japanese yen and euro 
our outlooks included in management s discussion and analysis assume exchange rates during remain constant at january levels 
a plus or minus point movement in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million and net income of approximately million 
a plus or minus point movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million but would have a negligible effect on net income 
interest rate risk management it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
our policy prescribes that total variable rate debt will not exceed of the total debt portfolio at anytime 
at december   our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than of variable rate instruments
