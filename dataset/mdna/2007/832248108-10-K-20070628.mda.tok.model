accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on whether it qualifies and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship 
for derivatives that qualify and have been designated as hedges for accounting purposes  changes in fair value have no net impact on earnings  to the extent the derivative is considered perfectly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged  until the hedged item is recognized in earnings commonly referred to as the hedge accounting method 
for derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes  changes in fair value are recorded in current period earnings commonly referred to as the mark to market method 
application of the hedge accounting method under sfas requires significant resources  extensive record keeping and systems 
as a result of rising compliance costs and the complexity associated with the application of hedge accounting  the company elected to discontinue the use of hedge accounting for its commodity derivatives during the third quarter of fiscal all existing commodity hedging relationships were de designated as of january  the company has also elected not to apply hedge designations for any exchange traded commodity derivative contracts entered into since january  under sfas  the company may elect either method of accounting for its derivative portfolio  assuming all the necessary requirements are met 
the company has in the past  and may in the future  avail itself of either 
table of contents acceptable method 
regardless of their designation under sfas  the company believes all its derivative instruments represent economic hedges against changes in prices and rates 
commodities the company s meat processing and hog production operations use various raw materials  mainly corn  lean hogs  live cattle  pork bellies  soybeans and wheat  which are actively traded on commodity exchanges 
the company hedges these commodities when management determines conditions are appropriate to mitigate the inherent price risks 
while this hedging may limit the company s ability to participate in gains from favorable commodity fluctuations  it also tends to reduce the risk of loss from adverse changes in raw material prices 
commodities underlying the company s derivative instruments are subject to significant price fluctuations 
any requirement to mark to market the positions that have not been designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas could result in volatility in the company s results of operation 
the company attempts to closely match the hedging instrument terms with the hedged item s terms 
financial instruments the company has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge exposure to changes in interest rates on certain financial instruments and periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain of its foreign currency exposure 
foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are recorded as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges  as appropriate  and were not material to the results of operations in fiscal or the size and mix of the company s derivative portfolio varies from time to time based upon the company s analysis of current and future market conditions 
the following table provides the fair value gain loss of the company s open derivative financial instruments as of april  and april  in millions livestock grains interest rates foreign currency in addition  as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of april   the company had million of forward grain contracts which  if valued at april  market prices  would be million  and the company had unpriced forward grain contracts which if valued at april  market prices would be million 
these forward grain contracts are accounted for as normal purchases as defined by sfas as a result  they are not marked to market 
the following table presents the sensitivity of the fair value of the company s open commodity contracts and interest rate and foreign currency contracts to a hypothetical change in market prices or in interest rates and foreign exchange rates  as of april  and april  in millions livestock grains interest rates foreign currency for the fiscal year ended april   the company reported gains on its closed derivative instruments of million 
for the fiscal year ended april   the company reported gains on its closed derivative instruments of million 
for the fiscal years ended april  and april   the company hedged approximately and of its grain purchases and and of its livestock produced  respectively 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions 
the estimates and assumptions are based on the company s experience combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
these estimates may differ from actual results 
certain of the company s accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to reflect the company s financial position and results of operations and require significant or complex judgment on the part of management 
the following is a summary of certain accounting policies considered critical by the management of the company 
income taxes the determination of the company s provision for income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
significant judgment is required in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items 
the company establishes reserves when  despite the belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  it believes that certain positions may be successfully challenged 
when facts and circumstances change  the reserves are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which requires the adjustment of past methods of judgment in assessing the timing and amounts of deductible and taxable items commencing the first quarter of fiscal derivative accounting the company accounts for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas which requires that all derivatives be recorded in the balance sheet as either assets or liabilities at fair value 
accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on whether it qualifies and has been designated as part of a hedging relationship 
for derivatives that qualify and have been designated as hedges for accounting purposes  changes in fair value have no net impact on earnings  to the extent the derivative is considered perfectly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the risk being hedged  until the hedged item is recognized in earnings commonly referred to as the hedge accounting method 
for derivatives that do not qualify or are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes  changes in fair value are recorded in current period earnings commonly referred to as the mark to market method 
under sfas  the company may elect either method of accounting for its derivative portfolio  assuming all the necessary requirements are met 
the company has in the past  and may in the future  avail itself of either acceptable method 
pension accounting the measurement of the pension obligation  costs and liabilities is dependent on a variety of assumptions regarding future events 
the key assumptions used by the company include discount rates  salary growth  retirement ages mortality rates and the expected return on plan assets 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the discount rate assumption is based on investment yields available at year end on corporate bonds rated aa and above with a maturity to match the company s expected benefit payment stream 
the salary growth assumptions reflect the company s long term actual experience  the near term outlook and assumed inflation 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  investment strategy and historical returns of the asset categories 
the effects of actual results differing from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the company s recognized expense in such future periods 
the company s discount rate used to measure its pension obligations as of april  and april  was 
the expected return on plan assets as of april  remained at 
the company s 
table of contents pension plan funding was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively  and is expected to be at least million in fiscal beyond fiscal  pension funding is expected to decrease moderately 
however  a significant devaluation of plan assets would cause a significant increase in funding while more favorable returns would reduce funding requirements 
future legislative actions could also impact future funding 
the company expects pension expense for fiscal to be approximately million 
sensitivity analysis the effect of the indicated changes in the selected assumptions is shown below for april   assuming no changes in benefit levels and no amortization of gains or losses for the company s major plans in fiscal in millions assumption percentage point change increase in funded status increase in equity change in fiscal expense discount rate expected return on assets the company recorded net expense in the consolidated statements of income related to its pension plans of million and million  net of million and million of expected pension returns  for fiscal and  respectively
