item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  describe certain business risks 
consideration should be given to the risk factors described below as well as those in the safe harbor statement at the beginning of this form k  in conjunction with reviewing the forward looking statements and other information contained in this form k 

table of contents a significant portion of our revenues from product sales and services are dependent on significant customers and specific industries 
sales to sun and citrix combined accounted for approximately and of our fiscal and revenues 
for the fiscal years ended december   and  sales directly to sun accounted for  and of our total net revenues  respectively 
sales to citrix accounted for  and of our fiscal  and total net revenues  respectively 
a significant reduction in sales to either customer  or significant pricing and additional margin pressures exerted on us by either customer  would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
in addition  if either customer delays or cancels purchases of our products  our operating results would be harmed and our ability to accurately predict revenues  profitability and cash flows would decrease 
in addition  we are dependent on the computer and networks  telecommunications  medical and imaging industries for a significant portion of our revenues 
our revenues are directly dependent on the level of capital spending for technology in the us and international economies 
if spending for technology declines in any of these industries over an extended period of time  it would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our future success in business strategy is dependent upon our ability to generate significant revenues from world leading oems and isvs development relationships 
we believe we must continue to diversify our revenues  and a major component of our business strategy is to form product and services development relationships with world leading oems and isvs 
we market our customized services and products to specific customers and niche industries 
this reduces competition from larger cms because of the costs involved for them to run the smaller manufacturing volumes typical of these orders 
the level of engineering complexity and after the sale service and support on some products reduce competition for vars of all levels of size and geographic coverage 
we believe we differentiate ourselves from other competitors through the strength of our close relationships with our very large oem partners sun  intel  amd  hp and others  our ability to offer and deliver complete turnkey solutions in relatively short development cycles  our unique product set and our full service after the sale offering 
our future success will depend on our ability to establish relationships with new customers  as well as expanding sales to our existing customers 
if we are unable to expand our sales to existing customers and develop relationships with new customers  our revenues and operating results could suffer 
if we are unable to grow our international revenues and successfully overcome the risks inherent in international business activities  the growth of our business may be limited 
the company s ability to grow will depend in part on the growth of its international revenues 
if our professional services around the development  deployment and support of sophisticated computer systems are not accepted across international regions  our ability to increase our revenues in this region would be limited 
in addition  our international sales are subject to the risks inherent in international business activities  including cost of customizing products for foreign countries  export and import restrictions  such as those affecting encryption commodities and software or those requiring local content  difficulties in providing customer support  reduced protection of intellectual property rights and increased liability exposure  regional economic and political conditions  and unique product requirements of certain foreign countries which may limit sales and or require significant additional research and development investments 
the majority of our international sales currently are us dollar denominated 
as a result  any increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies makes our products less competitive in international markets 
because of this our revenues may be adversely affected  or we may be required to denominate more of our sales in foreign currencies at some point in the future to remain competitive 
in addition  because certain of our operating expenses related to our international sales are denominated in foreign currency  we may have difficulty controlling expenses in the event of significant currency fluctuations 

table of contents if our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies are based on assumptions that change or prove to be incorrect  our operating results could fall below expectations of investors  resulting in a decline in our stock price 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate significant estimates used in preparing our financial statements  including those related to revenue recognition inventory write downs accounts receivable collections termination accruals income tax accruals stock based compensation  and warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  as provided in our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these and other estimates if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions  which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  resulting in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly revenues and operating results may fluctuate which could cause our results from operations to fall below expectations and thus impact the market price of our common stock 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
none of our customers are obligated to purchase any quantity of our products in the future nor are they obligated to meet forecasts of their product needs 
our operating expense levels are based in part on expectations of future revenues and gross profits  which are partially dependent on our customers ability to accurately forecast and communicate their future product needs 
if revenues or gross profits in a particular quarter do not meet expectations  operating results could suffer and the market price of our common stock could decline 
factors affecting quarterly operating results include the timing and size of orders from customers  particularly our largest customers  the product mix of our sales  the timing of new product introductions by our oem customers  the availability and or price of products from suppliers  the loss of key suppliers or customers  price competition  competition in professional services around the development  deployment and support of sophisticated computer systems market is significant and if we fail to compete effectively  our financial results will suffer 
in the market of custom engineered computer system products  we face significant competition from a number of different types of sources 
our competition includes other cms that provide similar engineering and manufacturing services  other vars and less expensive off the shelf products 
many of these companies are larger than we are and have greater financial resources and name recognition than we do  as well as significant distribution capabilities and larger  more established service organizations to support their products 
our larger competitors may be able to leverage their existing resources  including their extensive distribution capabilities and service organizations  to provide a wider offering of products and services and higher levels of support on a more cost effective basis than we can 
if we fail to compete successfully in this market  the demand for our product and services would decrease 
customers make buying decisions based on many factors  including among other things  product performance and quality  availability and quality of support and other services  price  interoperability  ease of doing business  a vendor s ability to adapt to customers changing requirements  responsiveness  contractual terms and conditions  vendor reputation and vendor viability 
as competition increases  each factor on which we compete becomes more important and the lack of competitive advantage with respect to one or more of these factors could lead to a loss of competitive position  resulting in fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  reduced margins  reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share 
these competitive pressures could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 

table of contents reliance on a single source supplier could delay product shipments and increase our costs 
we depend on many suppliers for the necessary parts and components to manufacture and repair products 
there are a number of vendors producing the parts and component that we need 
however during fiscal year  we purchased approximately of all inventory directly from sun or through sun s distribution channel 
we believe all critical production components and service parts  or suitable substitutes  are readily available in the marketplace from multiple manufacturers and or suppliers  new or refurbished  as required by our current customers demands 
if we were unable to purchase on acceptable terms or experienced significant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary parts and or components from a particular vendor and we had to find a new supplier for these parts and components  our new and existing product or repair shipments could be delayed which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our products may have quality issues that could adversely affect our sales and reputation 
in the course of conducting our business  we experience and address quality issues 
some of our products and repairs contain defects  including defects in our engineering  design and manufacturing processes  as well as defects in third party components included in repair or product builds  which may be beyond our control 
often defects are identified during our design  development and manufacturing processes and we are able to correct many of these 
when a quality issue is identified  we work extensively with our customers to remedy such issues 
we may test the affected product to determine the root cause of the problem and to determine appropriate solutions 
if we are unable to determine the root cause or find an appropriate solution  we may delay shipment to customers 
defects in our repair or product builds can harm our reputation  delay or prevent sales  result in significant expense and could materially and adversely affect our business 
if we fail to attract and retain appropriate levels of qualified employees and members of senior management  we may not be able to successfully execute our business strategy 
our success depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled engineering  sales  customer service  and managerial personnel 
if we are unable to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel  particularly personnel knowledgeable in software engineering and product management  we may not be able to meet key objectives such as developing  upgrading  or producing our repair and product builds in a timely manner  which could negatively impact our business and could hinder any future growth 
if we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls  we may not be able to accurately report our financial results 
as a result  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could have a negative market reaction 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires our management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting starting in with management s report on internal controls required for the fiscal year 
we are in the process of establishing a program to perform the system and process evaluation and testing necessary to comply with these requirements 
as a result  we will incur increased expense and will devote additional management resources to section compliance 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports  our business and operating results could be harmed 
if the site of our production and service operations were to experience a significant disruption in its operations  it would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our production and service facilities and headquarters are located in two buildings within two miles of each other 
if the operations in either facility were disrupted as a result of a natural disaster  fire  power or other utility outage  work stoppage or other similar event  our business could be seriously harmed as a result of interruptions or delays in our manufacturing  engineering  services or other post sales support operations

sales sales by segment for  and were as follows in thousands total sales product services sales for were million compared to million in  an increase of 
the product sales totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the services sales totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the significantly higher sales compared to were due to solid organic growth in programs with existing customers coupled with the business acquired with the acquisition 
the increase in product sales was primarily due to increased production and shipments in substantially all customer markets  including medical  telecommunications  computer and imaging 
during the fourth quarter  the company experienced an unusually high level of orders from our two largest customers  sun microsystems  inc and citrix systems  inc 
citrix  which accounted for of our fourth quarter revenues and of our revenues 
the high level of product sales from citrix in was at a margin too low for the company to accept in the future 
therefore  the company s revenues from citrix in will be lower 
the increase in sales from to was million  or an increase of 
the product sales increased million from to  or an increase of 
the increase in product sales was due to increased shipments to medical  telecommunications and defense customers  which more than offset lower shipments to imaging and industrial control customers

table of contents gross profit gross profits for  and were as follows in thousands total gross profit product services the gross profit margin percentage for  and were as follows total gross profit product services the gross profit in was million compared to million in  an increase of 
the product gross profit totaled million in compared to million in  an increase of 
the services gross profit totaled million in compared to million in  a decrease of 
gross margin as a percentage of sales declined to in from in this decline is due  in part  to inefficiencies caused by the transition of production from the monrovia facility to groveport  start up of major new programs  completing lower margin product business  higher costs associated with producing record shipments  and change in mix of products produced and services provided 
services gross profit margins are consistently higher than product gross profit margins 
as the mix of revenues has become more concentrated with product revenues  the overall gross margin has declined 
overall  service gross profit margins declined from to as the company experienced a higher than usual margin on services delivered in the latter half of in addition  the decline in gross profit was due to incremental costs associated with redesigning the groveport facilities for improved scalability  establishing a new logistics hub facility in groveport  higher volume of non recurring engineering services  as well as the write off of certain inventories 
the increase in gross profit from to was million  or an increase of 
the product gross profit decreased by million from to  or a decrease of 
the services gross profit increased by million from to  or an increase of 
the decrease in gross profit dollars and percentage on product sales in was due to sales mix as we implemented first time programs with large medical  imaging and network equipment customers during the year 
the volume in these programs and the resulting increases in operating efficiency and gross profit contribute significantly to bottom line profitability 
the increase in the gross profit dollars and percentage for service sales in was attributable to the organic growth in service sales as well as the addition of acquired customer programs 
gross margins will vary from program to program  and the mix of programs will vary from quarter to quarter causing the gross margin percentages to vary from quarter to quarter 
consequently  it is difficult to predict gross margin results for future revenues 
as the company continues to focus on its operational improvements and efficiencies  the company expects gross margins to improve
