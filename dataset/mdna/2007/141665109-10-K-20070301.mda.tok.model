our schools and universities prepare students for professionally and personally rewarding careers through the operation of on ground campuses located throughout the united states and in france  canada  italy  and the united kingdom and two fully online academic programs 
we evaluate our business based on our operating segments  which we define as our operating divisions 
each of our school and university operating divisions represents a group of for profit  postsecondary schools that offer a variety of degree and non degree academic programs and are differentiated based on a variety of criteria including  but not limited to  brand name  academic offerings  and geographic location 
we have six school reportable segments  the academy segment  the colleges segment  the culinary arts segment  the health education segment  the international segment formerly known as the inseec segment  and the university segment  and one non school reportable segment  the jdv online segment 
the academy segment includes our international academy of design and technology iadt campuses that collectively offer academic programs primarily in the career oriented discipline of visual communications and design technologies in a classroom setting 
the colleges segment includes schools that collectively offer academic programs in our core career oriented disciplines of business studies  health education  information technology  and visual communications and design technologies in a classroom or laboratory setting 
the culinary arts segment includes our le cordon bleu and kitchen academy schools that collectively offer culinary arts programs in the career oriented disciplines of culinary arts  baking and pastry arts  and hotel and restaurant management primarily in a classroom or kitchen setting

the jdv online segment s primary ventures include chefs 
com  a consumer focused culinary website  and blish 
com  a comprehensive online marketplace aimed at uniting buyers and sellers of digital content 
during  in connection with our commitment to a more focused business strategy  we will be eliminating our jdv online segment by transferring chefs

the student population of each of our continuing school reportable segments as of january  and  was as follows student population as of january  segment university segment health education segment culinary arts segment academy segment colleges segment international segment student population excludes sbi springfield  which is currently being taught out as discussed above  our university segment schools offer fully online academic platforms 
as of january  and  approximately  and  students  respectively  were enrolled in fully online academic programs at our university segment schools 
see note segment reporting of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of the financial results of our reporting segments for each of the last three years and for a discussion of the seasonality of the results of operations four our schools 
overview 
total revenue from continuing operations during was billion  a decrease of million  or  from total revenue during of billion 
operating income from continuing operations during was million  a decrease of million  or  from operating income from continuing operations during of net income from continuing operations during was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income from continuing operations during of million  or per diluted share  a decrease of million  or 
the decline in our continuing operating results represents a continuation of weak operating performance experienced in recent periods  which has been influenced by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  the continued probation status of our aiu schools  tightened credit standards and collection practices implemented to mitigate our bad debt exposure  general competitive pressures for student leads and enrollments experienced by some of our schools  the ed s general restrictions on our ability to open new branch campuses in  the continued negative impact of legal and regulatory matters  and the related negative publicity and negative press coverage regarding us and certain of our schools 
the ed notified us in a january   letter that it had lifted restrictions it imposed in june that had prevented us from acquiring domestic schools and opening additional branch campuses of our existing domestic schools 
we believe that the factors identified above have adversely impacted the rate at which our leads for prospective students convert into enrolled students conversion rate and the rate at which our enrolled students start school start rate 
the combined conversion rate and start rate of our continuing schools declined during by percentage points and percentage points relative to the combined conversion rate and start rate achieved by our continuing schools during income from continuing operations as a percentage of total revenue from continuing operations declined from during to during the decrease in continuing operating profit margin percentage during was primarily attributable to an unfavorable segment revenue mix change resulting in disproportionately larger revenue declines in our university segment  which produced the highest operating profit margins during  a decrease in operating profit margin percentage generated by our university segment  driven primarily by a decline in revenue  caused  in part  by reductions of the prices of our aiu online associate s degree programs  an increase in administrative expenses  and the disproportionate growth of ctu online  which operates at a lower operating profit margin percentage than does aiu online  increased occupancy expense and other fixed costs as a percentage of revenue due to declines in revenue  goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges of approximately million attributable to our health education segment  share based compensation costs of approximately million recorded in connection with our adoption of sfas r  and severance costs associated with the retirement of our former chairman of approximately million 
the decrease in continuing operating profit margin percentage was offset  in part  by a decrease in bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue 
we expect to be a period of transition and opportunity 
while our results continue to be negatively affected by a number of near term factors  we have taken steps during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of to address these issues and better position the company to achieve its long term potential 
we have executed on several measures as part of a strategic plan to better focus our business  increase efficiency and profitability  and ensure that the company s priorities align with those of our students 
these initiatives include the following we are completing a corporate realignment that will facilitate more consistent customer focused decision making by reducing redundancies and streamlining the decision making process 
we have developed an online service center to leverage significant online and on ground capabilities to provide students at all of our schools with more flexible educational delivery options 
through the service center  the technology that aiu online and ctu online currently use will be leveraged to make online and flexible education available across all of our schools 
as a service provider  the service center will offer customization to meet the varying needs of our students and the varying curricula of our individual schools 
the ability to offer flexible educational delivery combined with the large number of and variety of our brick and mortar campuses further distinguishes us in the marketplace  giving more students more choices to learn in ways that fit more lifestyles 
we have introduced measures that we believe will have a positive impact on admissions productivity  including a supplemental compensation program for admissions representatives  extended payment plans for students  a process for better qualification of leads  and a greater focus on referrals 
we continue to focus on building our strengths in careers of passion 
on november   we announced our intention to sell schools and campuses  including our entire gibbs segment and select schools in the colleges segment 
by focusing on areas where we have the greatest competitive advantages and proven success  we believe we can more effectively prepare students for careers they are passionate about through our high quality boutique schools  gold standard brands  and flexible student centered product offerings 
we are continuing to open start up campuses and have made an international acquisition consistent with our focus on premier schools and careers of passion 
we will continue to evaluate individually the pricing of each of our programs at each of our schools to ensure that the prices of our academic offerings are properly aligned with perceived value  identified price sensitivities  and competitive forces 
we will continue to evaluate the alternative financing options that we and our lenders make available to prospective students 
we will strive to provide greater flexibility in alternative financing options to give prospective students diverse and affordable options to finance the cost of their education 
we believe that the significant steps we have taken to realign and refocus our business will both position the company in the short term as an innovative leader in the delivery of high quality postsecondary education and allow us to cost effectively leverage our assets to build long term value 
we continue to be committed to delivering value over the long term to our students  employees  and stockholders 
current business and industry opportunities  challenges and risks in addition to the risk factors discussed in part i  item a risk factors of this annual report on form k  we have identified a number of key factors and trends related to our business and industry that represent opportunities  challenges  and risks 
sacs probation status of aiu 
as previously disclosed  on december   the commission on colleges of the southern association of colleges and schools sacs placed aiu on probation status for one year pending aiu s satisfactory remediation of certain accreditation matters with regard to sacs principles of accreditation 
this action followed a july sacs special committee visit of aiu which resulted in a report identifying specific recommendations for addressing certain deficiencies with respect to aiu s compliance with the sacs principles of accreditation 
in october  a sacs special committee completed site visits of selected aiu campuses 
at sacs december  meeting  sacs extended aiu s probation status through december under sacs rules  an institution may remain on probation status for two consecutive years  after which sacs must either lift the probation or remove the institution from membership 
this action has had  and will continue to have  a disruptive effect upon operations of aiu and our business generally  including  the diversion of significant time and attention of aiu s senior management  which adversely affected our results of operations for  and which we expect will adversely affect our results of operations in aiu remains accredited during this probationary period and is committed to resolving all issues identified by sacs 
we cannot predict the outcome of sacs future accreditation actions  and unfavorable outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our growth prospects  student population  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
us department of education review 
as previously disclosed  the us department of education ed notified us in june that it was reviewing our previously announced restated consolidated financial statements and our annual compliance audit opinions for the years through at the same time  the ed also advised us that it was evaluating four pending school program reviews that were conducted at certain of our schools  three of which were completed and closed during the ed indicated that until these matters were addressed to its satisfaction  it would not approve any new applications by us for pre acquisition review or change of ownership 
the ed further advised us that  during the review period  it would not approve applications for any additional branch campuses  which the ed generally refers to in its regulations as additional locations 
in a november  meeting  officials of the ed informed us that it would select ten to of our institutions for program reviews to be conducted before it would consider lifting the restrictions on new applications described above 
during the months of november and december  and january and february  the ed conducted site visits at ten of our institutions as part of such program reviews 
the ed notified us in a january   letter that  based upon the preliminary results of these program reviews  it would remove the growth restrictions that it imposed in june the ed stated that any subsequent request by us to expand our operations would be considered in accordance with the ed s standard operating procedures 
the ed emphasized that the removal of the growth restrictions should not be construed to suggest that any title iv compliance issues identified had been resolved or that program reviews currently in process would be concluded 
the ed s restriction of our ability to open new branch campuses prohibited our ability during and the second half of to pursue domestic expansion opportunities in underserved or emerging markets 
sales plan for certain of our schools and campuses 
on november   our board of directors approved a plan to sell of our schools and campuses the sales plan 
the sales plan includes the anticipated sale of our nine gibbs campuses  which collectively comprised our entire gibbs reportable segment  mcintosh college mcintosh  lehigh valley college lehigh  and brooks college brooks  including brooks long beach  california and sunnyvale  california campuses 
mcintosh  lehigh  and brooks were previously components of our colleges reportable segment 
while we believe that each of the campuses included in the sales plan is a valuable asset with effective academic programs  we do not believe that our continued operation of these campuses is consistent with our near term and long term strategic goals 
we will continue to reasonably invest in the campuses included in the sales plan in preparation for a sale 
we believe that the sales plan is a critical component of our overall strategy to strengthen operational results and provide more effective focus on preparing students for careers they are passionate about through high quality boutique schools  gold standard brands  and flexible student centered program offerings 
also  upon selling the campuses in the sales plan  we believe that we will be better positioned to target our business strategy and leverage resources to maximize value for our students  employees  and stockholders 
we have not yet secured a buyer for any of the schools or campuses included in the sales plan  but we have retained an investment banking firm to assist our management in identifying potential buyers and evaluating any proposals put forth by any such potential buyers 
each of the schools and campuses within the sale group is available for immediately sale in its present condition  and we anticipate completing the sale of each of the campuses included in the sales plan during the sales will be subject to approval by the ed and various state regulatory and accrediting agencies  as applicable 
in connection with the execution of the sales plan  we have recorded non cash charges of million  net of income tax benefit of million  during to write down to fair value the carrying value of tangible and intangible assets of the campuses to be sold 
the results of operations of the schools and campuses included in the sales plan have been classified as discontinued operations 
see note discontinued operations of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of our accounting for discontinued operations 
decline in university segment profitability 
the operating margin percentage of our university segment  excluding share of affiliate earnings  declined to during the year ended december   from during the year ended december  the decline in university segment operating profit margin percentage during is primarily attributable to the decline during in the combined operating profit margin percentage of our university segment s fully online academic platforms  which include aiu online  ctu online  and stonecliffe college online an academic division of ctu 
a significant portion of the total student population  revenue  and operating profits of our university segment are attributable to aiu online 
however  aiu online student population  revenue  and operating profit declined during the decrease in aiu online s student population  revenue  and operating profits is primarily attributable to the maturation of aiu online s academic offerings and the adverse impact of negative publicity related to aiu s probation status with its accrediting body  sacs 
these factors have adversely impacted aiu online s start rate during the year ended december   relative to its start rate during the year ended december  due to the accelerated nature of aiu online academic programs  aiu online revenue per student is generally greater than revenue per student generated by our other schools 
thus  given the relatively quick turnover of aiu online students  when aiu online experiences student start declines  the impact on student revenue  and  ultimately  operating profits  is significant and immediate  because new revenue generating student starts are insufficient to replace graduating students 
the decline in aiu online student population  revenue  and operating profits is also attributable to greater competition and greater consumer price sensitivity within the online  postsecondary education market 
in response to such emerging market forces  aiu continually evaluates its online programs to ensure that the programs are market relevant and competitively priced 
aiu has historically marketed aiu online s programs as premium academic product due to the quality of educational content and the technology used to deliver the program 
however  market research conducted by aiu during revealed the significant price sensitivity among prospective students for aiu online s associate s degree programs 
based on this information  aiu online reduced the pricing of its associate s degree programs beginning in july aiu did not identify similar price sensitivities among prospective students for aiu online s bachelor s and master s degree programs and  thus  it did not reduce the pricing of its bachelor s and master s degree programs 
we believe there remains a high level of interest in aiu online s accelerated programs  and aiu expects to further expand aiu online s program offerings to include part time offerings for bachelor s and master s degrees 
also  as previously discussed  we expect that the combined operating margin percentage achieved by our university segment and our university segment s online platforms will continue to decline from prior period levels primarily as a result of the continued disproportionate operating profit growth of ctu online and stonecliffe college online an academic division of ctu 
ctu online has historically operated at a lower operating margin percentage than that of aiu online 
thus  the growth of ctu online operations is effectively lowering the operating margin percentage of the university segment as a whole 
additionally  as a result of the disproportionate growth of ctu online and the introduction of stonecliffe college online  both of which offer longer termed programs than does aiu online  we expect average revenue per online student to continue to decrease in the future 
however  we believe that by providing our students with a flexible array of online program options  we will enhance our university segment schools ability to expand their presence in the online  postsecondary education market 
the results of operations and operating margin percentage of our university segment during were positively impacted by a decrease in bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease in university segment bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue was primarily attributable to an increased focus on the collection of amounts due from students who have left school  mainly through the use of outside collection agencies 
impact of changes in credit standards 
we believe that student population  revenue  and operating profits at certain of our schools were negatively impacted during as a result of the implementation by sallie mae in march of stricter credit standards at all of our schools for certain prospective students seeking to fund a portion of their education through sallie mae s non recourse loan program our decision to stop offering loans made under the stillwater bank purchase agreement to new students  and the continued application of strict credit standards by all of our schools 
we believe these stricter credit standards have reduced bad debt expense from previous levels but also have limited the number of prospective students who qualified for certain private financing options 
we believe that the stricter credit standards had the most significant impact during on our culinary arts segment operating results 
the inability of prospective students to qualify for private financing options generally has a greater effect on our culinary arts segment schools than on our other schools because our culinary arts schools culinary arts programs  on average  are priced higher than other programs offered by our schools 
also  certain of our culinary arts segment schools are destination schools that attract students from outside the local community  and  generally transplanted students who attend these destination schools utilize private financing options to fund living expenses in addition to tuition expenses 
these factors generally result in prospective culinary arts program students requiring greater access to private financing sources to finance the difference between total tuition and living expenses for their chosen academic program and any funding that may be available to the student through federal or state financial aid programs 
during august and september of  we reevaluated the impact of stricter credit standards and implemented certain changes in the credit standards for students at all of our schools 
we also began offering our students extended payment plans to finance their tuition 
these extended payment plans allow students to make an affordable monthly payment while they attend school and pay their remaining balance after they graduate or leave school 
under our extended payment plans  students may be granted up to years to repay their extended payment plan balances  which is generally the same amount of time that students are granted to repay their stafford loans 
these changes to our credit standards were intended to mitigate  in part  the negative effects of our original tightening of credit standards for all schools 
we believe the changes to our credit standards implemented during the third quarter of and our offering of extended payment plans positively affected our culinary arts segment schools and health education segment schools ability to start students during the second half of relative to the first half of the culinary arts and health education segments were most significantly impacted by the third quarter changes to our credit standards and our offering of extended payment plans because the schools within our culinary arts segment generally start the greatest number of students during august and september  and the schools within our health education segment generally start new students consistently each month during the year 
our other operating divisions generally start the greatest number of students during july  thus  we do not expect these credit standard changes or our extended payment plan offerings to significantly affect student starts until international expansion 
we believe that the international market for our services represents a significant growth opportunity 
we believe that international students are increasingly utilizing online us educational programs as a means of obtaining a us education without incurring the related significant travel and living costs and facing stringent visa requirements associated with studying abroad 
additionally  we continue to pursue opportunities to expand our on ground presence internationally  both through the organic growth of our existing schools  such as our inseec group schools  and through potential acquisitions of foreign educational institutions 
on january   we acquired istituto marangoni  a world renowned post secondary fashion and design school with locations in three prominent international fashion capitals milan  london  and paris 
the acquisition expands our european market and marks our entry into the italian market 
istituto marangoni  which has approximately  students  offers undergraduate and graduate level diploma programs in fashion design and other related fields such as fashion styling  fashion business  fashion promotion  furniture design  product design  interior design and graphic design 
reorganization of our management structure and reportable segments 
prior to the first quarter of  based on our interpretation of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  we had identified two reportable segments colleges  schools  and universities  which represented our on ground schools that provide educational services primarily in a classroom or laboratory setting and offered a variety of degree and non degree certificate and diploma programs in each of our core career oriented disciplines  and the online education group  which represented the fully online academic platforms offered by aiu  aiu online  and colorado technical university ctu  ctu online and stonecliffe college online an academic division of ctu 
the on ground campuses of aiu and ctu were previously included as part of the colleges  schools  and universities segment 
during the first quarter of  our university division completed a reorganization of its management structure  specifically with respect to the management of our university division schools  aiu and ctu  and those universities fully online academic platforms 
since the reorganization  both the on ground campuses and the fully online platforms of aiu and ctu have been analyzed by us as one operating segment 
during the third quarter of  our colleges division completed a reorganization of its management structure 
since this reorganization  all schools within the colleges division have been managed by a single divisional management team and the division s results have been analyzed by us as a single operating segment 
prior to the reorganization  the operations of the colleges division were segregated into two divisions based on the geographic locations of the schools 
upon completion of the university and the college division s reorganizations  we also evaluated our other operating segments in accordance with the provisions of sfas based on our interpretation of sfas  we identified six school reportable segments the academy segment  the colleges segment  the culinary arts segment  the health education segment  the international segment formerly known as the inseec segment  the university segment and one non school reportable segment the jdv online segment 
all prior period financial and population information included herein has been restated to reflect our new internal management structure and the resulting changes in the composition of our reportable segments 
increased competition 
during  we experienced increased competition for our universities fully online platforms and in certain of the markets served by our campuses 
hybrid learning 
during  we made advances in the development of our unique hybrid learning model  which capitalizes on our schools online campuses virtual campus platform and enables students at our on ground campuses to complete their academic programs on ground or online 
aiu and ctu were our first on ground schools to offer hybrid educational programs as a complement to those schools existing online campuses 
we expect to expand our hybrid learning offerings to other selected schools during adoption of share based compensation accounting rules 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires that all share based payments to employees and non employee directors be recognized in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instrument issued 
we previously accounted for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method as defined in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees opinion 
prior to january   no share based employee compensation cost  other than the insignificant costs associated with infrequent issuances of shares of nonvested stock  was reflected in our statements of income 
during the year ended december   we recognized share based compensation expense of approximately million  pretax  approximately million of which is attributable to our continuing operations 
approximately million of share based compensation recognized during was recorded in connection with modifications made during to certain options held by our former chairman

summary of significant accounting estimates we have identified the accounting estimates listed below as those that we believe require management s most subjective and complex judgments in estimating the effect of inherent uncertainties 
this section should be read in conjunction with note significant accounting policies of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k  which includes a discussion of these and other significant accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend unsecured credit for tuition to a portion of the students who are enrolled at our schools 
based upon past experience and judgment  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts with respect to tuition receivables 
our schools calculate and record allowances for doubtful accounts based on a standard allowance estimation methodology developed by corporate financial management 
our standard allowance estimation methodology considers a number of factors that  based on our collections experience  we believe have an impact on students credit risk and the realizability of our student receivables 
among these factors are a student s status in school or out of school  anticipated funding source for example  federal loan or grant  state grant  private loan  student cash payments  etc  whether or not an out of school student has completed his or her program of study  and our overall collections history 
out of school students include students who have withdrawn from or completed their programs of study 
all other students are classified as in school students 
our allowance estimation methodology divides our accounts receivable due from in school students into groups according to each student s primary funding source 
our allowance methodology for out of school student accounts separates such accounts into two categories of students those who have completed their programs of study and those that have not 
we apply allowance percentage estimates that are based upon our historical collections experience to each in school student funding source group and out of school student category 
we monitor our collections and write off experience to assess whether adjustments to our allowance percentage estimates are necessary 
as a result we believe that our allowance estimation methodology reflects our most recent collections experience and is responsive to changes in the total mix of student funding sources 
changes in trends in any of the factors that we believe impact the realizability of our student receivables  as noted above  or modifications to our credit standards  collection practices  and other related policies may impact our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial results 
our standard allowance estimation methodology is evaluated for propriety by corporate financial management on a periodic basis and modified as necessary 
changes to the design of our standard allowance estimation methodology  including our allowance percentage estimates  may impact our estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts and our financial results 
corporate financial management reviews the allowance estimate calculations completed by each of our campuses to monitor compliance with our allowance estimation methodology 
a one percentage point change in our allowance for doubtful accounts for continuing operations as a percentage of gross student receivables for continuing operations as of december   would have resulted in a change in net income from continuing operations of million during the year then ended 
because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from title iv programs  any legislative or regulatory action that significantly reduces the funding available under title iv programs  or the ability of our students or schools to participate in title iv programs  would likely have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial condition  including the realizability of our receivables 
contingencies we accrue for costs associated with certain contingencies  including  but not limited to  settlement of legal proceedings and regulatory compliance matters  when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
liabilities established to provide for contingencies are adjusted as further information develops  circumstances change  or contingencies are resolved 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair market value of identifiable net assets acquired through business purchases 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment on at least an annual basis by applying a fair value based test 
in evaluating the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the fair value of our reporting units  as defined under sfas if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
in performing our annual review of goodwill balances for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units based primarily on projected future operating results and cash flows  and other assumptions 
projected future operating results and cash flows used for valuation purposes may reflect considerable improvements relative to historical periods with respect to  among other things  revenue growth and operating margins 
although we believe our projected future operating results and cash flows and related estimates regarding fair values are based on reasonable assumptions  historically  projected operating results and cash flows have not always been achieved 
the failure of one of our reporting units to achieve projected operating results and cash flows in the near term or long term may reduce the estimated fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value and result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
we monitor the operating results and cash flows of our reporting units on a quarterly basis for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value and goodwill impairment 
see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of goodwill impairment considerations and related charges we recognized during the year ended december  long lived assets on an ongoing basis  we review property and equipment  definite lived intangible assets  and other long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
to date  no such events or changes in circumstances have occurred 
if such events or changes in circumstances occur  we will recognize an impairment loss if the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are less than the carrying value of the related asset 
the impairment loss would adjust the asset to its fair value 
in evaluating the recoverability of long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of such assets 
if our fair value estimates or related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges related to long lived assets and definite lived intangible assets 
discontinued operations we account for discontinued operations  including our schools and campuses currently held for sale  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the net assets of assets held for sale are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
the results of operations of discontinued operations are segregated from those of continuing operations and reported as discontinued operations in our consolidated statement of income 
see note discontinued operations of the notes to our consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this annual report on form k for further discussion of our accounting for discontinued operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
this requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory income tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred income tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred income tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred income tax assets the expected future income tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred income tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future income tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates  or future taxable income levels could materially impact our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
share based compensation expense on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r 
sfas r  which is a revision of sfas  replaces our previous accounting for share based awards under opinion for periods beginning in sfas r requires that all share based payments to employees and non employee directors  including grants of stock options  shares of nonvested stock  and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans  be recognized in the financial statements based on the estimated fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we previously accounted for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method defined in opinion prior to january   no share based compensation cost  other than insignificant costs associated with infrequent issuances of nonvested stock  was reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this method  share based compensation cost recognized during includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of january   based on grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas and share based compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
under the modified prospective transition method  the provisions of sfas r were not applied to periods prior to adoption  and  thus  prior period financial statements have not been restated 
in accordance with sfas r  the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model 
our determination of the fair value of stock option awards is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
the variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of each stock option award and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior 
in addition  sfas r requires companies to estimate forfeitures of share based awards at the time of grant and revise such estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from original projections 
certain of the shares of nonvested stock that we have granted to participants are subject to performance conditions that may affect the number of shares of nonvested stock that will ultimately vest at the end of the requisite service period 
we refer to these awards as performance vesting nonvested stock 
share based compensation associated with performance vesting nonvested stock awards is recognized only to the extent that we believe performance conditions attributable to such awards will ultimately be satisfied 
our estimate of the number of performance vesting nonvested stock awards that will ultimately be awarded must be revised during each reporting period  if necessary 
we must exercise considerable judgment to estimate the number of performance vesting nonvested stock will ultimately be awarded based on the expected satisfaction of associated performance conditions

revenue university segment culinary arts segment colleges segment health education segment academy segment international segment jdv online segment student starts university segment culinary arts segment colleges segment health education segment academy segment international segment excludes starts for sbi springfield  which is currently being taught out 
total revenue from continuing operations decreased million  or  from billion during the year ended december   to billion during the year ended december  the overall decrease in revenue is primarily attributable to decreases in revenue generated by the university segment  the culinary art segment  and colleges segment  offset  in part  by increases in revenue generated by our health education segment  academy segment  and international segment 
the overall decline in revenue was caused primarily by decreases in student starts and student population during  but our revenue growth prospects were also hindered to a certain degree by our inability to open new branch campuses or acquire domestic campuses as a result of restrictions imposed on us by the ed 
such restrictions were lifted by the ed in january of university segment revenue 
university segment revenue decreased million  or  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the combined revenue for our university segment schools fully online platforms  including aiu online  ctu online  and stonecliffe college online  decreased million  or  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the overall university segment revenue decrease is primarily attributable to declines in student population and student starts during we believe the declines in university segment student population and student starts are primarily attributable to the effects of the ongoing sacs probation status of our aiu universities  which was announced by sacs on december   extended by sacs for one year on december   and continues to negatively impact our university segment schools ability to recruit new students 
the adverse effect of the sacs probation status  accompanied by increased competition  has resulted in a decrease in student population and revenue at each of our aiu universities and has most dramatically impacted the operating results of aiu online  one of our most profitable businesses 
also  contributing  in part  to the decline in revenue was the impact of the aiu online associate s degree program price reductions introduced during the third quarter of the decrease in university segment revenue associated with decreases in aiu revenue during was offset  in part  by an increase in revenue generated by our university segment s ctu online platform 
the increase in ctu online revenue is primarily due to an increase in ctu online student population during relative to ctu online student population during ctu online s student population growth is primarily attributable to its broadening penetration of the expanding online education market through increased investment in marketing activities and recruiting efforts and an expansion of program offerings and online platforms 
modest improvements in university segment student retention during also contributed positively to university segment revenue 
culinary arts segment revenue 
culinary arts segment revenue decreased million  or  from million during to million during the culinary arts segment revenue decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in culinary arts segment schools average student population during  relative to culinary arts segment schools average student population during the decrease in average student population during is primarily attributable to declines in culinary arts segment conversion rates and show rates during we believe that the declines in conversion rates and start rates during were caused  in part  by strict credit standards implemented by all our schools to mitigate our bad debt exposure 
the existence of strict credit standards effectively limit the number of prospective culinary arts students who qualify for certain private financing options 
the strict credit standards generally have a more significant effect on our culinary arts segment schools because these schools typically offer higher priced academic programs relative to academic programs offered by our other segment s schools 
during the third quarter of  we implemented changes in the credit standards for all of our schools students 
such changes  while in compliance with our overall principles of fiscal responsibility  are intended to mitigate  in part  the negative effects of our original tightening of credit standards for all schools 
colleges segment revenue 
colleges segment revenue decreased million  or  from million during to million during the colleges segment revenue decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in student population for our colleges segment schools during  a decline in colleges segment student starts during compared to colleges segment student starts during  and continuation of weak operating performance experienced in recent periods by a many of our colleges segment schools 
we believe that the continuing weak operating performance experienced by many of our colleges segment schools is primarily attributable to the continued negative impact of certain legal and regulatory matters and the related negative publicity  negative press coverage regarding certain of our colleges segment schools  and general competitive pressures for student leads and enrollments experienced by certain of our colleges segment schools 
health education segment revenue 
health education segment revenue increased million  or  from million during to million during the health education segment revenue increase is primarily attributable to tuition price increases affected during  a modest increase in average student population during  which we believe is a result of changes in our credit standards for all schools implemented during the third quarter of  a continued strengthening of student starts at certain of our health education segment schools  and a shift in student enrollment mix that resulted in higher average revenue per student 
educational services and facilities expense educational services and facilities expense increased million  or  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the increase in educational services and facilities expense is primarily attributable to an overall increase in certain academic and occupancy costs incurred by our university segment schools  offset  in part  by decreases in other student related expenses  including the costs of laptops  books  and other program materials  attributable to decreases in student population at most of our schools during the increase in university segment educational services and facilities expense is primarily attributable to increases in variable expenses incurred by ctu online necessary to support increases in student population 
the increase is also attributable to costs related to additional student service activities designed to improve retention  an increase in costs associated with curriculum development activities  and increased occupancy costs associated with facility expansions in support of university segment online platforms during and increases in occupancy costs incurred by our health education segment schools and culinary arts segment schools during in connection with recent facility expansions also contributed to the overall increase in education services and facilities expenses during the increase in educational services and facilities expenses during was mitigated  in part  by the continuation of cost cutting measures enacted during in response to the overall declines in average student population at a majority of our campuses 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in administrative  advertising  marketing  and admissions costs incurred by our university segment  health education segment  and culinary arts segment schools and approximately million of share based compensation expense recognized during  in connection with our adoption of sfas r 
the increase in university segment administrative expenses during the period is primarily attributable to costs incurred by aiu in connection with the university s efforts to remediate its probation status with its accrediting body 
the increase in university segment administrative expense is also attributable to increases in variable administrative costs incurred by ctu in response to increased student enrollments during the period 
the increase in university segment advertising  marketing  and admissions costs during the period is primarily attributable to costs incurred by ctu online and stonecliffe college online in support of increased student lead  enrollment  and start volume 
the increases in administrative  advertising  marketing  and admissions costs incurred by our health education segment and culinary arts segment schools are primarily attributable to variable costs incurred to support student enrollments and starts 
the increases in general and administrative expenses during are also attributable to additional employee salary and benefit costs incurred during in connection with our accounting  financial aid processing  and cash collections centralization efforts and increases in employee headcount within our corporate and school compliance departments and our corporate internal audit and legal departments 
additionally  included in general and administrative expenses during are charges of approximately million and million  respectively  attributable to future cash severance payments due to our former chairman and share based compensation expense recorded in connection with modifications made during the fourth quarter of to certain options held by our former chairman 
the increase in general and administrative expense discussed above was offset  in part  by an overall decrease in bad debt expense during of approximately million

bad debt expense by segment university segment culinary arts segment colleges segment health education segment academy segment international segment jdv online segment corporate and other total bad debt expense the overall decrease in bad debt expense during is primarily attributable to a decrease in overall student receivable exposure at a majority of our schools  primarily as a result of declines in student population during the period  overall improvement in student retention  and improvement in our collections experience 
the university segment schools generally experience higher bad debt expense levels than those of our other schools due primarily to the historically lower student retention rates at our university segment schools online platforms 
lower student retention generally results in a shift in the relative distribution of student receivables balances from in school student receivables to out of school student receivables 
out of school student receivable balances generally pose a greater a credit risk than do in school student receivables and are subject to higher bad debt allowance percentages 
in addition  we believe that the overall retention rate of our university segment schools will be lower for the foreseeable future relative to historical retention rates of university segment schools as a result of the expected disproportionate growth of ctu online and stonecliffe college online 
both ctu online and stonecliffe college online offer longer academic programs than does aiu online  and our universities longer program offerings have traditionally experienced a higher rate of student attrition than our universities accelerated program offerings 
the increase in overall general and administrative expenses during was mitigated  in part  by the continuation of cost cutting measures enacted during in response to the overall declines in average student population at a majority of our campuses

also contributing to our decrease in operating profit during was non cash share based compensation expense of million incurred in connection with our adoption of sfas r and the declines in university segment operating profit and operating profit margin percentage 
as discussed above  we believe that the declines in university segment operating profit and operating profit margin percentage are primarily attributable to the negative effects of the ongoing sacs probation status of the university segment s aiu universities and increased competition

provision for income taxes provision for income taxes decreased million  or  from million during  to million during the decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in income before provision for income taxes during of approximately million  excluding the effect of the million goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge incurred for our health education segment during the unusual effective income tax rate of reflected in our statement of income during is attributable to the fact that only million of our total million health education segment goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge  which is included in operating expenses  is deductible for income tax purposes

excluding the effect of the non deductible goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge  our effective income tax rate for was 
we reduced our effective income tax rate from during to during  excluding the effect of the non deductible health education segment goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge 
the decrease in our effective tax rate is attributable to the impact of various tax planning strategies  favorable changes in the proportionate distribution of our total pretax income among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate  and an increase in tax exempt interest earned on invested cash balances 
future changes in the proportionate distribution of our total pretax income among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate may further impact our effective income tax rate

educational services and facilities expense educational services and facilities expense increased million  or  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the increase in educational services and facilities expense was primarily attributable to an overall increase in academic and occupancy costs across all our segments 
the increase was primarily driven by increases in salaries and benefits of academic staff hired by our campuses during to support the growth of the business  with the most significant increases attributable to the online platforms of our university segment 
the increase in educational services and facilities expense is also attributable to costs associated with additional student service activities designed to improve retention  an increase in curriculum development activities  and an increase in occupancy costs associated with facilities expansions in support of our schools online campuses during a portion of the increase is also attributable to investments made during in new start up campuses and stonecliffe college online 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased million  or  from million during the year ended december   to million during the year ended december  the majority of this increase was attributable to an increase in university s segment general advertising  marketing  and admissions costs  driven primarily by costs incurred by university segment online campuses in support of increased student lead  enrollment  and start volume 
the increase is also attributable to increased financial aid  career services  and other administrative costs incurred by university segment online campuses to support increases in online campus student population 
the increase in general and administrative expense also reflects investments made during by ctu online in stonecliffe college online 
the increase in general and administrative expenses is also attributable to increases in corporate salaries and benefits costs  caused largely by personnel increases within the corporate compliance  internal audit  and legal departments 
corporate personnel increases associated with certain centralized functions  including accounting  financial aid processing  and cash collections  also contributed to the significant increase in corporate salaries and benefits costs 
the increase in corporate salaries and benefits costs was offset  in part by a decrease in outside counsel legal fees  primarily attributable to a reduction in outside legal costs related to our class action lawsuits  the ongoing sec investigation and the development of our internal legal department during the increase in general and administrative expense discussed above was offset  in part  by an overall decrease in bad debt expense during the period of approximately million

out of school student receivable balances generally pose a greater credit risk than do in school student receivables and are subject to higher bad debt allowance percentages 
the decline in online student retention during was attributable largely to the disproportionate growth of ctu online 
ctu online  offers longer programs and has historically experienced a higher rate of student attrition than has aiu online 
thus  the disproportionate growth of ctu online during resulted in a reduction in the overall retention rate of the university segment and an overall increase in university segment bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue 
the decrease in bad debt expense attributable to our other segments is primarily attributable to a decrease in overall student receivable exposure  primarily as a result of strong cash collections and strict credit practices exercised during the period 
also  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash  pre tax charge for a change in accounting estimate of our allowance for doubtful accounts of approximately million
