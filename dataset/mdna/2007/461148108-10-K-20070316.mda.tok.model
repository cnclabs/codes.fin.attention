item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
words such as believes  expects  anticipates and the like indicate forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements include comments related to our projected revenue  gross margin  operating expense  profitability  income tax expense  effective tax rate  capital spending and cash balances  the adequacy of our cash balances to fund our operations  projected volatility in our financial results  projected customer requirements for new capacity and technology upgrades for our installed base of magnetic disk manufacturing equipment and when  and if  our customers will place orders for these products  projected change from period to period in the customers  and location of customers  that constitute the majority of our revenues  the length of development  marketing and deployment cycles for military customers  imaging s ability to proliferate its technology into major military weapons programs and to develop and introduce commercial products  and the timing of delivery and or acceptance of our backlog for revenue 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements for a variety of reasons  including those set forth under risk factors and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview our operations include two businesses  equipment and imaging 
the equipment business designs  manufactures  markets and services complex capital equipment that deposits highly engineered thin films of material onto disks used in hard disk drives and we are developing equipment that we plan sell to semiconductor manufacturers 
our imaging business develops and manufactures electro optical sensors  cameras and systems that permit highly sensitive detection of photons in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum  allowing vision in extreme low light situations 
the vast majority of our revenue is currently derived from our equipment business  and we expect that the majority of our revenues for the next several years will continue to be derived from our equipment business 
equipment business in the early s we developed a system  the mdp  to deposit magnetic films and protective overcoats onto magnetic disks used in hard disk drives 
this system gained wide acceptance and by the late s was being used to manufacture approximately half of the disks used in hard disk drives worldwide 
in late  we introduced a new system  the lean 
we believe that there are a total of approximately mdp and lean systems currently available for use in production and research and development applications at magnetic disk and hard disk drive manufacturers worldwide 
the hard disk drive industry has gone through significant consolidation  and there are now only seven significant manufacturers of magnetic disks  some of whom also manufacture hard disk drives 
as a result of the small number of customers and the high average selling price of our products  our equipment revenues tend to be volatile from quarter to quarter 
in addition  our equipment business has historically been subject to capital spending cycles 
for example  in the period from through the middle of  we sold million of disk manufacturing equipment 
in the period from the middle of thru  our disk equipment revenues averaged approximately million per year and consisted of the sale of a limited number of systems  technology upgrades  parts and service for the installed base of our systems 
in  our sales of disk manufacturing equipment grew to million in annual revenues 
we believe there is significant potential for magnetic disk manufacturers to continue adding capacity 
we believe that the introduction of high density disks based on perpendicular recording techniques will also require disk manufacturers to significantly upgrade the technical capability of their installed base of manufacturing equipment to accommodate the additional number of process steps predicted to be required by perpendicular recording technology roadmaps 
in the past we also manufactured both deposition and rapid thermal processing equipment used in the manufacture of flat panel displays 
in late  we sold our rapid thermal processing product line and stopped actively marketing our deposition product line 
from through  cumulative revenues from sales of flat 
table of contents panel display manufacturing systems totaled million 
revenues included million related to selling a license to one of our flat panel patents and recognizing revenue on the last flat panel system we shipped 
imaging business our imaging business develops and manufactures electro optical sensors  cameras and systems that permit highly sensitive detection of photons in the visible and near infrared portions of the spectrum  allowing imaging in extreme low light situations 
our military products include extreme low light sensors and cameras for use in short to medium range military applications and livar cameras and systems for positive target identification at long range 
the majority of the funding for our imaging business activities has historically been derived from research and development contracts with the united states government and its contractors  with the balance being funded internally 
developing advanced products for the military involves long development cycles  as products move through successive multi year stages of technology demonstration  engineering and manufacturing product development  prototype production and then product deployment 
each stage in this process requires ongoing government funding 
to date  substantially all of our imaging business revenues has been derived from contract research and development  rather than product sales 
in july  in order to shorten the time to market and to increase the number of markets for our imaging products  we began to fund development of imaging products for commercial markets 
in early  we acquired deltanu  llc  a manufacturer of raman spectrometers 
although product revenues from these activities have not yet been significant  we expect revenues from product shipments to significantly increase as a percentage of imaging revenues 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial conditions and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they become known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
many of these uncertainties are discussed in the prior section entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with us gaap  and provide a meaningful presentation of our financial condition and results of operation 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates we make in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
we also have other key accounting policies and accounting estimates related to the collectibility of trade receivables and prototype product costs 
we believe that these other accounting policies and other accounting estimates either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or subjective  or it is less likely that they would have a material impact on our reported results of operation for a given period 

table of contents revenue recognition certain of our system sales with customer acceptance provisions are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
if we have previously met defined customer acceptance levels with the specific type of system  then we recognize revenue for the fair market value of the system upon shipment and transfer of title  and recognize revenue for the fair market value of installation and acceptance services when those services are completed 
we estimate the fair market value of the installation and acceptance services based on our actual historical experience 
for systems that have generally not been demonstrated to meet a particular customer s product specifications prior to shipment  revenue recognition is typically deferred until customer acceptance 
for example  while initial shipments of our lean system were recognized for revenue upon customer acceptance during  revenue was recognized upon shipment for the majority of leans shipped in and most of the systems in backlog at december  are for customers where we have met defined customer acceptance levels  and we expect to recognize revenue upon shipment for those systems 
in some instances  hardware that is not essential to the functioning of the system may be delivered after acceptance of the system 
in these cases  we estimate the fair market value of the non essential hardware as if it had been sold on a stand alone basis  and defer recognizing revenue on that value until the hardware is delivered 
in certain cases  we sell limited rights to our intellectual property 
revenue from the sale of any intellectual property license is generally recognized at the inception of the license term 
we perform best efforts research and development work under various government sponsored research contracts 
these contracts are a mixture of cost plus fixed fee cpff and firm fixed price ffp 
revenue on cpff contracts is recognized in accordance with contract terms  typically as costs are incurred 
revenue on ffp contracts is generally recognized on the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
provisions for estimated losses on government sponsored research contracts are recorded in the period in which such losses are determined 
inventories inventories are priced using average actual costs  which approximate first in  first out  and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated excess and obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand 
we evaluate the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
a cost to market reserve is established for work in progress and finished goods inventories when the value of the inventory plus the estimated cost to complete exceeds the net realizable value of the inventory 
warranty we provide for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
our warranty is per contract terms  and for our systems  the warranty typically ranges between and months from customer acceptance 
we use estimated repair or replacement costs along with our actual warranty experience to determine our warranty obligation 
we exercise judgment in determining the underlying estimates 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely 
table of contents than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on our history of losses through  our deferred tax asset was fully offset by a valuation allowance as of december  during  the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance were both reduced due to the usage of our remaining nol and credit carry forwards 
as of december   million of the deferred tax asset was valued on the balance sheet  net of a valuation allowance of million 
this represents the amount of the deferred tax asset from which we expect to realize a benefit 
we cannot predict with certainty when  or if  we will realize the benefit of the portion of the deferred tax asset currently offset with a valuation allowance 
on a quarterly basis  we provide for income taxes based upon an annual effective income tax rate 
the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the level of our projected earnings  the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  net operating loss carry forwards  availability of tax credits and the effectiveness of our tax planning strategies 
we carefully monitor the changes in many factors and adjust our effective income tax rate on a timely basis 
if actual results differ from the estimates  this could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  as our projected level of earnings increased throughout  we increased the annual effective tax rate from at the end of the first quarter  to at the end of the second quarter  to at the end of the third quarter and to at the end of the fourth quarter 
the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with our expectations could have a material effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations

the increase in equipment revenues in was the result of the sale of forty six lean systems  thirteen disk lubrication systems and a significant increase in revenue from disk equipment technology upgrades and spare parts 
during  we sold twenty three lean systems  six mdp systems and fourteen disk lubrication systems 
revenues also included million of flat panel equipment and license sales 
during  we sold eleven lean systems and two mdp systems 
the magnetic disk manufacturing industry consists of a small number of large manufacturers 
in seagate acquired maxtor  which further concentrates our customer base 
we believe that the majority of our active customers utilize most of their capacity and that there is significant potential for these customers to both continue adding capacity and to upgrade the technical capability of their installed base to permit production of high density disks for perpendicular recording rather than the current longitudinal technology 
we currently have twenty five lean systems in backlog  which are scheduled for revenue recognition during the first half of imaging revenues increased by to million in  which consisted of million of product revenue and million of contract research and development revenue 
the million in imaging revenues consisted of  of product revenue and million of contract research and development revenue 
the increase in product revenue resulted from higher sales of livar systems and commercial products 
the increase in contract research and development revenue was the result of a better mix of fully funded vs 
partially funded 
table of contents programs 
the decrease in imaging revenues in as compared to was the result of a reduction in the level of orders received for funded development programs 
in  we expect the imaging business revenue to grow significantly  with increases in both contract research and development revenue and product revenue 
although we do not anticipate our imaging business to be profitable in  we expect the loss to be reduced from substantial growth in future imaging revenues is dependent on proliferation of our technology into major military weapons programs  the ability to obtain export licenses for foreign customers  obtaining production subcontracts for these programs  and development and sale of commercial products 
our backlog of orders at december  was million  as compared to a december  backlog of million 
the million of backlog at december  consisted of million of equipment backlog and million of imaging backlog 
the million of backlog at december  consisted of million of equipment backlog and million of imaging backlog 
the increase in equipment backlog was primarily the result of orders for lean disk sputtering systems 
significant portions of our revenues in any particular period have been attributable to sales to a limited number of customers

our largest customers tend to change from period to period 
international sales totaled million  million and million  in  and  respectively  accounting for  and of net revenues 
the increase in international sales in and in was primarily due to an increase in net revenues from disk sputtering systems 
substantially all of our international sales are to customers in asia  which includes products shipped to overseas operations of us companies 
our mix of domestic versus international sales will change from period to period depending on the location of our largest customers in each period

cost of net revenues for included  of equity based compensation expense 
equipment gross margin improved to in from in our product mix  increased average selling prices  cost reduction programs and increased volume all contributed to the higher gross margin for the year 
equipment gross margin improved over the gross margin achieved in due primarily to lower manufacturing costs and a higher average selling price for lean systems 
the flat panel manufacturing system recognized for revenue in was originally shipped in and contributed minimal gross profit 
equipment gross margin in was adversely impacted by costs incurred during the rapid production  installation and start up of the initial production run of lean systems  by costs for scrap  rework and inventory obsolescence related primarily to design changes on our lean system  and by favorable pricing offered to our first lean customer 
we expect the gross margin for the equipment business to improve in  primarily as a result of 
table of contents continued cost reduction efforts undertaken on the lean system 
gross margins in the equipment business will vary depending on a number of factors  including product cost  system configuration and pricing  factory utilization  and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
imaging gross margin improved to in from in the increase in imaging gross margin resulted from a higher percentage of contract research and development revenue being derived from fully funded contracts  favorable adjustments related to closing out prior year government rate audits and increased product shipments 
the improvement in imaging gross margin in as compared to was primarily due to a reduction in cost shared research and development contracts
