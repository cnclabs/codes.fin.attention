item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of various factors including the risks we discuss in item a of part i  risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview our business we are engaged in the development  manufacture  marketing and sale of minimally invasive therapies for the treatment of vascular disease 
our primary focus is the marketing and sale of the powerlink system  a catheter based alternative treatment to surgery for abdominal aortic aneurysms  or aaa 
aaa is a weakening of the wall of the aorta  the largest artery of the body 
once aaa develops  it continues to enlarge and if left untreated becomes increasingly susceptible to rupture 
the overall patient mortality rate for ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms is approximately  making it the th leading cause of death in the united states 
prior to the acquisition of former endologix and the restructuring that occurred during the third and fourth quarters of  we were researching  developing and marketing a radiation therapy catheter for the treatment of blockages in arteries after angioplasty  or restenosis 
prior to that we developed  manufactured and marketed other catheter and stent products for treatment of cardiovascular disease 
between and  our source of revenues shifted gradually from direct sales of previous catheter and stent products to royalties from licenses of our stent delivery technology 
in june  we licensed to guidant corporation rights to manufacture and distribute products using our focus technology for the delivery of stents in exchange for milestone and royalty payments 
our license revenue has significantly decreased in and  reaching the contractual minimum level of  we anticipate that license revenue will remain at this minimum level through  the remaining term of the license agreement  and that the sales of our powerlink system will be our only material source of revenue 
for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we believe that our current cash balance  in combination with cash receipts generated from sales of the powerlink system and borrowings available under our new credit facility  will be sufficient to fund ongoing operations through at least december  if we do not realize expected revenue and gross margin levels  or if we are unable to manage our operating expenses in line with our revenues  or if we cannot maintain our days sales outstanding accounts receivable ratio  we may not be able to fund our operations through december  in the event that we require additional funding to continue our operations  we will attempt to raise the required capital through either debt or equity arrangements 
we cannot provide any assurance that the required capital would be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that any financing activity would not be dilutive to our current stockholders 
if we are not able to raise additional funds  we may be required to significantly curtail our operations and this would have an adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our 
table of contents estimates  including those related to collectibility of customer accounts  whether the cost of inventories can be recovered  the value assigned to and estimated useful life of intangible assets  the realization of tax assets and estimates of tax liabilities  contingent liabilities and the potential outcome of litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies and estimates were used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and accounts receivable we comply with the revenue recognition guidelines in sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collection of the relevant receivable is probable at the time of sale  and products have been shipped or used and the customer has taken ownership and assumed risk of loss 
we earn royalty revenue  which is included in license revenue in the consolidated statement of operations  as a result of the sale of product rights and technologies to third parties 
royalties are recognized upon the sale of products subject to the royalty by the third party 
we do not offer rights of return or price protection and we have no post delivery obligations other than our specified warranty 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on our review of the aging of customer balances  correspondence with the customer  and the customer s payment history 
if additional information becomes available to us indicating the financial condition of the customer is deteriorating  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand  as driven by economic and market conditions  and the product s shelf life 
if actual demand  or economic or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets we record an impairment charge  or expense  for long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the value recorded for the asset may not be recoverable 
future changes in operations could cause us to write down the asset value and record an expense to better reflect our current estimate of its value 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential goodwill impairment include a significant decrease in our stock price and our evaluation of a control premium that may be used when estimating our total fair value 
our stock price may decline  or other factors may arise  which could result in goodwill impairment in future periods 
factors that may impact whether there is a potential impairment to our indefinite lived intangible assets include legal and regulatory considerations 

table of contents income taxes we reduce our deferred tax assets to zero due to uncertainties concerning the future realization of the related tax benefits  primarily due to our history of losses 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize some or all of the tax benefit of the deferred tax assets  the valuation allowance would be reduced  resulting in increased income in the period such determination was made 
stock based compensation effective at the beginning of our fiscal year  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas r 
this statement requires us to recognize the cost of employee and director services received in exchange for the stock options it has awarded 
under sfas r  we are required to recognize compensation expense over an award s vesting period based on the award s fair value at the date of grant 
we have elected to adopt sfas r on a modified prospective basis  accordingly  the financial statements for the periods prior to january  do not include stock based compensation under the fair value method 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to value its stock option grants 
the fair value for awards that are expected to vest is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term 
the amount of expense attributed is net of an estimated forfeiture rate  which is updated as appropriate 
this option pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected volatility of our common stock  pre vesting forfeiture rate and an option s expected life 
the financial statements include amounts that are based on our best estimates and judgments 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to our investment in our domestic field sales personnel  and increased market acceptance of the powerlink system 
united states sales increased from million to million  and sales to distributors outside the united states did not change from million in and sales to edwards lifesciences ag decreased to million in from million in our distribution agreement with edwards lifesciences ag was not renewed beyond the original expiration of december  and was replaced with a three year distribution agreement with lemaitre vascular 
this agreement named lemaitre vascular as the exclusive distributor of the endologix powerlink system in ten european countries  including austria  belgium  the czech republic  france  germany  luxembourg  the netherlands  sweden  switzerland  and the united kingdom 
there were no distributors in that accounted for more than of product sales  and no distributors other than edwards lifesciences ag that accounted for more than of product sales in license revenue 
license revenue remained unchanged at  in and  which represents the contractual minimum annual amount from guidant 
we believe license revenue will remain unchanged in cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue increased to million from million in this increase is attributable to the higher unit volume of product sales in compared to gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher product sales in as compared to gross profit on product sales increased to million from million in because product sales volume more than doubled in from gross profit  as a percentage of product sales increased to in from in this increase in gross profit margin was due to an increase in product sales in the united states 
direct product sales in the united states have a higher gross profit margin compared to international product sales  which are sold through distributors 
additionally  the percentage in was impacted by a product recall and a facility relocation which resulted in period charges to cost of sales in the fourth quarter of approximately million 
a charge of  related to the final phase of the product recall was incurred in the second quarter of we believe that gross profit dollars will increase in future years due to higher commercial sales of the powerlink system in the united states 
we also expect that gross profit as a percentage of product revenues to remain relatively unchanged in as the increase in product sales in the united states will be offset by the effect of the significantly higher prices we are now paying for the raw graft material which we purchase from bard peripheral vascular systems  a subsidiary of cr bard  inc 
table of contents research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses increased by to million from million in the increase primarily resulted from continued product research and development of our powerlink system product and complementary technologies  and continued enrollment in the suprarenal arm of the pivotal united states clinical trials 
a  charge for stock compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january   also contributed to the increase 
we expect that research  development  and clinical expense will range between to million in  to support new product and process development projects 
marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from million in this increase was due to staffing increases in sales and marketing support functions in support of the expanded commercial launch of the infrarenal powerlink system in the united states market 
in addition  the increase was partially due to a  charge for stock compensation expense pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january  we expect that sales and marketing expense will continue to increase in  but at a lessor rate than in general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by to million from million in the increase was due to stock compensation expense totaling  pursuant to the adoption of sfas r at january  we expect only a modest growth in expenses in other income expense 
other income increased to million from  in  driven by higher interest income 
the increase in interest income was accounted for by a higher average invested cash balance in  which resulted from a registered direct public offering of our common stock that resulted in net proceeds of million in june comparison of years ended december  and product sales 
sales increased to million in from million in primarily due to a full year of product sales after receipt of fda approval in october united states sales increased from  to million  and sales to distributors outside the united states decreased from million to million 
sales to edwards lifesciences ag commenced in the second quarter of  and were million in and million in there were no other distributors in that accounted for more than of product sales 
in  other than edwards lifesciences ag  only bolton medical italia spa accounted for more than of product sales 
sales to this distributor in were  license revenue 
license revenue decreased to  in from million in royalties on licensed product sales by guidant decreased to  from  in starting in september  we believe that guidant replaced certain licensed products with unlicensed products in the united states 
also  we believe the introduction of drug coated stents in early has had a material negative effect on guidant s sale of the licensed product 
as a result  the royalties from guidant reached the contractual minimum annual amount of  in royalty revenue from escalon medical corporation was at the minimum  in our agreement with escalon expired in october cost of product revenue 
the cost of product revenue increased to million from million in this increase is attributable to the higher unit volume of product sales in compared to gross profit 
gross profit increased to million in from million in the increase in gross profit resulted from higher product sales in as compared to  offset by the decrease in royalties received from guidant and escalon  which did not have an associated cost of revenue 
gross profit on product sales increased to million from million in because product sales volume more than doubled in from gross profit  as a percentage of product sales increased to in from in this increase in gross profit margin was due to an increase in product sales in the united states 
direct product sales in the united states have a higher gross profit margin compared to international product sales  which are sold through distributors 
this impact was offset by a product recall and a facility relocation which resulted in period charges to cost of sales in the fourth quarter of of approximately million 

table of contents research  development and clinical 
research  development and clinical expenses decreased by to million from million in marketing and sales 
marketing and sales expenses increased by to million from million in this increase was due to staffing increases in sales  marketing support  and customer service functions in support of the commercial launch of the infrarenal powerlink system in the united states market 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million from million in the increase in expenses in was due primarily to expenses related to our review of internal controls over financial reporting as required by section of the sarbanes oxley act  as well as expenses associated with building the infrastructure in our finance and information technology departments 
other income expense 
other income increased to  from  in  driven by higher interest income 
the increase in interest income was accounted for by a higher average invested cash balance in  which resulted from a private placement of our common stock which yielded aggregate net proceeds of million in july  and a higher rate of return on our investments 
liquidity and capital resources for the years ended december  and  we incurred net losses of million and million  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
historically  we have relied on the sale and issuance of equity securities to provide a significant portion of funding for our operations 
in april  we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec that would permit us to sell from time to time  up to a total of million of common stock 
in june  we completed a private placement of our common stock  which resulted in net proceeds of million  leaving million available under the shelf registration 
additionally  in july  march and july  we completed three private placements of our common stock  resulting in aggregate net proceeds of million 
in february  we entered into a revolving credit facility  whereby we may borrow up to million 
all outstanding amounts under the credit facility bear interest at a variable rate equal to the lender s prime rate plus  which is payable on a monthly basis 
the unused portion is subject to an unused revolving line facility fee  payable quarterly  in arrears  on a calendar year basis  in an amount equal to one quarter of one percent per annum of the average unused portion of the revolving line  as determined by the bank 
the credit facility also contains customary covenants regarding operations of our business and financial covenants relating to ratios of current assets to current liabilities and tangible net worth during any calendar quarter and is collateralized by all of our assets with the exception of our intellectual property 
all amounts owing under the credit facility will become due and payable on february  at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and marketable securities available for sale of million 
we believe that current cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  together with cash receipts generated from sales of the powerlink system and available borrowings under our credit facility  will be sufficient to meet anticipated cash needs for operating and capital expenditures through at least december  we expect to continue to incur substantial costs and cash outlays in to support powerlink system research and development  and united states marketing of the powerlink system 
however  if we fail to effectively penetrate the aaa market  or if we fail to reduce certain discretionary expenditures  if necessary  we may need to seek additional sources of financing 
we may not be able to obtain such financing on acceptable terms or at all  which would adversely affect the operations of our business 
the timing and amount of our future capital expenditure requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of market acceptance of the powerlink system  our requirements for additional manufacturing capacity  our requirements for additional it infrastructure and systems  
table of contents our requirements for additional office space  and the success of our research and development programs for future products and processes 
in july  the board of directors authorized a program for repurchases of our outstanding common stock of up to million under certain parameters 
as of december   we had repurchased an aggregate of  shares for  with the last such purchase in the quarter ended september  at this time  we do not anticipate further share repurchases 
accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable  net  increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was due to the increase in sales in inventories 
inventories increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase was primarily a result of higher sales in  and higher expected sales in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
accounts payable and accrued expenses increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase is attributable primarily to an increase in the amount owed to bard peripheral vascular systems for a key component of the powerlink system 
cash used in operations 
cash used in operations increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cash provided by used in investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  as compared to cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended december  this change was primarily due to an increase in purchases of available for sale securities and a decrease in maturities of available for sale securities in as compared to  offset by a decrease in capital expenditures for property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily a result of an increase in proceeds from the sale of common stock off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments in february  the former endologix entered into a supply agreement with bard peripheral vascular systems  a subsidiary of cr bard  inc for the supply of eptfe 
the supply agreement has an initial term through december  at which time it automatically renews on a year by year basis  for additional one year periods  unless either party gives the other party notice of its intention not to renew within days from the expiration date of the applicable renewal period 
under the terms of a second amendment to the supply agreement dated september   the minimum purchase requirements were reduced and we must purchase a specified annual dollar value of the component  as opposed to a quantity of units  for the remaining term of the agreement 
during  we purchased million of such materials  which fulfilled the purchase commitment 
as of december   expected future cash payments related to contractual obligations and commercial commitments were as follows total thereafter in thousands contractual obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligation 
table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we are currently evaluating the impact that the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier adoption is permitted  provided the company has not yet issued financial statements  including for interim periods  for that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation number  or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
this interpretation requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not believe that we currently have material exposure to interest rate  foreign currency exchange rate or other relevant market risks 
interest rate and market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment profile 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
we are averse to principal loss and try to ensure the safety and preservation of our invested funds by limiting default risk  market risk  and reinvestment risk 
we attempt to mitigate default risk by investing in only the safest and highest credit quality securities and by constantly positioning our portfolio to respond appropriately to a significant reduction in a credit rating of any investment issuer or guarantor 
at december   our investment portfolio included only high grade corporate bonds and commercial paper and government bonds all with remaining maturities of less than two years and denominated in us dollars 
the table below provides information about our available for sale investment portfolio  including funds designated as restricted cash 
for investment securities  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average fixed interest rates by expected maturity dates 
principal amounts by expected maturity in the subsequent twelve month periods ending december fair value at december  total in thousands except per share amounts cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash equivalents weighted average interest rate investments weighted average interest rate total portfolio weighted average interest rate 
table of contents foreign currency transaction risk 
we do not currently have material foreign currency exposure as the majority of our assets are denominated in us currency and our foreign currency based transaction exchange risk is not material 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded   and  respectively  of foreign currency transaction gains losses 
accordingly  we do not have a significant currency exposure at december
