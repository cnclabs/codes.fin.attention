with respect to the sale of domain registrations  we earn registration fees in connection with each new  renewed and transferred in registration and from providing provisioning services to service providers and registrars on a monthly basis 
domain registrations are generally purchased for terms of one to ten years 
payments for the full term of all services  or billed revenue  are received at the time of activation of service and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
other internet services currently consist of the sale of expiring domain names and digital certificates  billing  provisioning and customer care software solutions  hosted email and anti spam services  blogware and website building tools which are used by our service providers to create bundles of internet services for their end users 
we earn fees when a service is activated 
other internet services are generally purchased for terms of one month to three years 
payments for domain registrations and other internet services are for the full term of all services at the time of activation of service and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
on a retail basis  we offer internet services directly to end users through our domain direct division 
these services include domain registration and other internet services such as email  personalized email through our portfolio of surname based domain names  blogware  hosting and website creation 
depending on the service offered  domain direct receives standard fees for its services that are published on its website 
in addition  domain direct offers referral commissions based on a percentage of net registration revenues to participants in its affiliate program 
advertising and other revenue we also generate advertising and other revenue through our online libraries of shareware  freeware and online services presented at our website  www 
tucows 
com  as well as from traffic and search sessions originating on our portfolio of domain names 
our software libraries advertising revenue is generated from third party advertisers and from software developers who rely on us as a primary source of distribution 
software developers use our author resource center  or arc  to submit their products for inclusion in our software libraries and to purchase promotional placement of their software in the library categories  as well as purchase other promotional services on a cost per click through or flat rate basis 
software developers are able to promote their software through advertising services including keyword search placements  banners  promotional placements  expedited reviews and premium data services 
revenue is also generated from companies who contract with us to provide them with co branded content 
we offer pay per click advertising on the pages of certain domains within our domain name portfolio 
when a user types one of these domain names into the command line of the browser direct navigation  they are presented with dynamically generated links which are pay per click advertising 
every time a user clicks on one of the links listed on a web page  it generates revenue for us through our partnership with third parties who provide syndicated pay per click results 
advertising and other revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which it is presented 
critical accounting policies the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and methods 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties made by management that may result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   or fiscal includes further information on the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the application of these estimates  including those related to the recoverability of investments  useful lives of intangible assets  valuation of goodwill  product development costs  revenue recognition and deferred revenue and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
revenue recognition policy we earn revenues from domain registration fees on both a wholesale and retail basis and other internet services  and advertising and other revenue 
with respect to the sale of domain registrations and other internet services  we earn registration fees in connection with each new  renewed and transferred in registration and from providing provisioning services to service providers and registrars on a monthly basis 
we also enter into revenue arrangements in which a service provider may purchase a combination of services multiple element arrangements 
when fair value exists for all elements  we allocate revenue to each element based on the relative fair value of each of the elements 
fair value is established by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for arrangements where fair value exists only for the undelivered elements  we defer the full value of the undelivered elements and recognize the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered items as revenue  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
payments for the full term of all services  or billed revenue  are received at the time of activation of service and where appropriate are recorded as deferred revenue and are recognized as earned ratably over the term of provision of service 
this accounting treatment reasonably approximates a recognition pattern that corresponds with the provision of the services during the quarters and the year 
revenue from the sale of domain names  consists primarily of amounts earned for the transfer of rights to domain names that are currently under the company s control 
collectibility of revenues generated is subject to a high level of uncertainty  accordingly revenues are recognized only as received 
we also generate advertising and other revenue through our online libraries of shareware  freeware and online services presented at our website  www 
tucows 
com  as well as from traffic and search sessions originating on our portfolio of domain names 
advertising and other revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which it is presented 
to the extent that the minimum number of impressions we guarantee to customers is not met  we defer recognition of the corresponding revenues until the guaranteed impressions are achieved changes to contractual relationships in the future could impact the amounts and timing of revenue recognition 
in those cases where payment is not received at the time of sale  additional conditions for recognition of revenue apply 
the conditions are i that the collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and ii that we have no further performance obligations 
we record expected refunds  rebates and credit card charge backs as a reduction of revenues at the time of the sale based on historical experiences and current expectations 
should these expectations not be met  adjustments will be required in future periods 
we establish reserves for possible uncollectible accounts receivable and other contingent liabilities which may arise in the normal course of business 
historically  credit losses have been within our expectations and the reserves we have established have been appropriate 
however  we have  on occasion  experienced issues which have led to accounts receivable not being fully collected 
should these issues occur more frequently  additional reserves may be required 
product development costs we account for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position accounting for the cost of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  as more fully described in note to our audited consolidated financial statements for fiscal our policy on capitalizing internally developed software costs determines the timing of its recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or depreciation of property and equipment 
management reassesses these judgments on an ongoing basis 
changes in management s assessment could impact the recognition of development costs in our accounts 
valuation of intangible assets  goodwill and long lived assets our business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense that we may incur 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
we test goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas  which requires that we test goodwill  identifiable intangibles and long lived assets for impairment at least annually and more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events  as defined by sfas we determine if the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets or goodwill are impaired based on a projected discounted cash flow model using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
management will base its estimates in preparing the discounted cash flows on historical experience and on various other assumptions  including current market trends and developments  ongoing customer developments and general economic factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment on at least an annual basis or more often if events or circumstances warrant 
these impairment tests involve the use of discounted cash flow analyses to assess the fair value of the indefinite lived assets and the recoverability of the carrying value of these assets 
these analyses involve estimates of future cash flows  estimated periods of use and applicable discount rates 
if the fair values of these assets as determined above were less than the related carrying values  impairment losses would have been recognized  as applicable 
management has determined that there is no impairment of the carrying value of these surname domain names and direct navigation domain names at december  the company has chosen the end of its fiscal month of december as the date of its annual impairment test 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill is evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level 
while the ceo  who is the company s chief operating decision maker  monitors the sales of various products  operations are managed and financial performance evaluated based upon the sales and production of multiple products employing common network costs  research and development resources  sales and administrative support  and facilities 
this allows the company to leverage its costs in an effort to maximize return 
the company believes that any allocation of such shared expenses to various products would be impractical and arbitrary and it currently does not make such allocations internally 
as such  the company considers itself a single reporting unit 
in testing for a potential impairment of goodwill  the provisions of sfas require the application of a fair value based test at the reporting unit level 
we performed the annual goodwill impairment test as of december   and  and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  long lived intangible assets with determinable economic life are tested for recoverability whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
we determined that there were no events or circumstances that affected the recoverability of long lived assets 
accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
under the asset and liability method  we recognize deferred tax assets or liabilities for the anticipated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the benefit from the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  historical and future levels of income  expectations and risks associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies are considered 
in the event that it is determined that the deferred tax assets to be realized in the future would be in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be recorded 
this adjustment would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should it be determined that all or part of a recorded net deferred tax asset would not be realized in the future  an adjustment to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination would be made 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the probability that our deferred tax asset balance will be recovered to assess its realizability 
to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that some portion of our deferred tax assets will not be realized  we will increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets 
realization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these deferred tax assets  impacting net income or net loss in the period when such determinations are made 
accounting for stock based employee compensation on january   we adopted the fair value based method for measurement and cost recognition of employee stock based compensation arrangements under the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment or sfas r  using the modified prospective application transitional approach 
previously  we had elected to account for employee stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method based upon accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees or apb and related interpretations 
the intrinsic value method generally did not result in any compensation cost being recorded for employee stock options since the exercise price was equal to the market value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
under the modified prospective application transitional approach  stock based compensation is recognized for awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled subsequent to the date of adoption of sfas r 
in addition  stock based compensation is recognized  subsequent to the date of adoption of sfas r  for the remaining portion of unvested outstanding awards granted prior to the date of adoption 
prior periods have not been adjusted and we continue to provide pro forma disclosure as if it had accounted for employee share based payments in all periods prior to the adoption of sfas r in accordance with the fair value provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which is presented below 
we measure stock based compensation costs on the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award 
we have elected to treat awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the employee requisite service period  which in our circumstance is the stated vesting period of the award  provided that total compensation cost recognized at least equals the pro rata value of the award that has vested 
compensation cost is initially based on the estimated number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 
this estimate is adjusted to the vesting date once actual forfeitures are known 
had we adopted the fair value based method for accounting for stock based compensation in all prior periods presented  the pro forma impact on net income and net income per share would be as follows year ended december  net income  as reported add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net income  net of tax deduct total stock based employee compensation expense determined under fair value based method for all rewards  net of tax net income  pro forma earnings per common share  as reported earnings per common share  pro forma refer to note share based payments in these consolidated financial statements for details of stock options and stock based compensation cost recorded during fiscal results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  net revenues the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source year ended december  domain name and other internet services domain names  excluding domain direct other internet services  including domain direct total domain name and other internet services advertising and other revenue increase over prior period increase percentage the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source  as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  domain name and other internet services domain names  excluding domain direct other internet services  including domain direct total domain name and other internet services advertising and other revenue total net revenues for fiscal increased to million from million for the year ended december  or fiscal during fiscal  no customer accounted for more than of total revenue  and one customer accounted for of accounts receivable at december  significant management judgment is required at the time of recording of revenue to assess whether the collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
on an ongoing basis we assess the ability of our customers to make required payments 
based on this assessment  we expect the carrying amount of our outstanding receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  to be fully collected 
domain name and other internet services net revenues from domain name and other internet services for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million fiscal this increase was primarily as a result of higher volumes from new and existing customers  as well as the additional revenue earned from the hosted messaging assets we acquired from critical path in january  and from the acquisition of the name based domain assets from mailbank 
com  inc in june  which both have been integrated into other internet services and advertising and other revenue streams 
during fiscal  the number of domain names that we processed increased by approximately  to approximately million new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations  compared to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the fact that we continued to compete aggressively to attract new clients and retain existing customers in order to protect our current market share and improve our competitive position 
these actions have resulted in our average selling price declining  which has partially offset the impact of the increased transaction volume on our revenue and profitability 
we may face continued pricing pressure in order to remain competitive  which would adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
the renewal rate for domain name registrations increased to approximately for fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal during fiscal  revenue from domain names  excluding domain direct  comprised of total revenue  compared to for fiscal this percentage decrease primarily resulted from the recognition of revenues from the newly acquired hosted messaging assets 
this resulted in revenue from other internet services  including domain direct  increasing to of total revenue fiscal compared to for fiscal while we anticipate that the number of new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations will incrementally increase  the volatility in the market could affect the growth of domain names under our management 
during fiscal  the total number of domain names under our management increased by approximately million to approximately million  compared to fiscal as of december   we provided provisioning services to ten registrars on a monthly basis  as compared to five registrars at december   which registrars use our technical systems to process domain registrations with their accreditation 
as of december   we managed approximately million domain names  compared to approximately  at december   on their behalf 
deferred revenue from domain name registrations and other internet services at december  increased in line with the increase in revenues to approximately million from approximately million at december  advertising and other revenue advertising and other revenue for fiscal increased by million  or to million from million for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the increase in number of third party advertisements on parked pages  amounting to million for fiscal during fiscal  revenue from advertising and other revenue comprised of total revenue  compared to for fiscal cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the costs associated with providing domain registration and other internet services  advertising and other revenue and network costs 
cost of revenues for domain registrations represents the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term in which we provide the service 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered  and are recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
costs of revenues for other internet services consist of fees paid to third party service providers and are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided 
we have minimal direct cost of revenues associated with our advertising and other revenues 
therefore  the gross profit margin on advertising revenue is approximately and  accordingly  any increase or decrease in advertising and other revenue represents an increase or a reduction of our gross profit of approximately the same amount 
network costs include personnel and related expenses  including bandwidth and co location expenses to support the supply of all of our services 
bandwidth and co location expenses are composed primarily of communication and provisioning costs related to the management and support of our network 
the following table presents our cost of revenue  by revenue source year ended december  domain name and other internet services domain names  excluding domain direct other internet services  including domain direct total domain name and other internet services network  other costs network  depreciation and amortization costs increase over prior period increase percentage the following table presents our cost of revenues  by revenue source  as a percentage of total cost of revenues year ended december  domain name and other internet services domain names  excluding domain direct other internet services  including domain direct total domain name and other internet services network  other costs network  depreciation and amortization costs cost of revenues for fiscal increased by approximately million  or  to million from million for fiscal  primarily as a result of the higher costs attributable to increased volumes of domain registrations and other internet services of million and an increase in network costs of million 
the increase in network costs was primarily the result of the additional labor  bandwidth and co location costs required to manage the data centers of million  which includes  of transitional costs relating to the transfer of operational knowledge from critical path inc employees  in connection with the acquisition of the hosted messaging assets of critical path inc additional depreciation of million relating to information technology assets and increased amortization of  relating to our acquisitions  also contributed to the increased cost of revenues 
additional network costs of  were also incurred for travel to new co location facilities and for other related miscellaneous expenses 
the increase in cost of revenues as a percentage of total revenue was primarily the result of the proportionately greater network costs incurred to support and manage our expanded internet service offerings  most notably our hosted email platform 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full for each domain at the time when such domain is registered 
registry fees are recorded as prepaid domain registry fees and are recognized ratably over the term of provision of the service 
other internet service costs and icann accreditation transaction fees are generally paid either monthly or quarterly 
services provided over periods longer than one month are recognized ratably over the term of provision of the service 
during fiscal  direct cost of goods pertaining to domain names  excluding domain direct  comprised of the cost of goods  compared to for fiscal during fiscal  direct cost of goods pertaining to other internet services  including domain direct  comprised of total cost of goods  compared to for fiscal amortization of intangible assets consists of amounts arising in connection with the acquisition of technology from each of the boardtown corporation in april  the hosted messaging business of critical path  inc in january  and mailbank 
com inc 
in june the technology purchased in connection with the acquisition of boardtown corporation is amortized on a straight line basis over seven years  while the technology acquired in connection with each of the acquisitions of the hosted messaging assets of critical path  inc and the in house software of mailbank 
com inc  is amortized on a straight line basis over two years 
prepaid domain registration and other internet services fees at december  increased by approximately million  to approximately million from approximately million at december  we expect network costs to increase as our network expands geographically and network activity increases 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs 
these costs include commissions and related expenses of our sales  product management  public relations  call center  support and marketing personnel 
other sales and marketing expenses include customer acquisition costs  advertising and other promotional costs 
year ended december  sales and marketing increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues sales and marketing expenses fiscal increased by approximately million  or  to approximately million  compared to approximately million during fiscal the increase during fiscal was primarily the result of additional people costs of million  including the cost of approximately  relating to a severance payment   of stock based compensation as a result of our adoption of sfas r and the increase in staff needed to support our expanded hosted messaging assets 
in addition  in connection with our recent acquisition of our hosted messaging assets  we incurred transitional costs in the amount of  relating to knowledge transfer 
the increase was also a result of additional travel costs of  and additional marketing costs of  as we continue to extend our sales and marketing reach 
the increase in additional marketing costs was more than offset by the reversal of a contingency that was established for a marketing initiative but that is no longer required  amounting to  we believe that sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase  in absolute dollars  as we adjust our marketing programs and sales strategies to meet future opportunities in the marketplace 
technical operations and development technical operations and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses required to support the development of new or enhanced service offerings and the maintenance and upgrading of existing infrastructure 
this includes expenses incurred in the research  design and development of technology that we use to register domain names and other internet services and in the distribution of our digital content services 
in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and primarily include personnel costs for employees directly related to the development project 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
year ended december  technical operations and development increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues technical operations and development expenses for fiscal increased approximately million  or  to approximately million from approximately million for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of people related costs  including contract and outside service costs  which increased by approximately million 
such increase reflects our ongoing commitment to enhance and extend our opensrs platform  as well as the additional resources required to develop and support our other internet services  including our hosted messaging service 
included in this increase in people costs is  of transitional costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of the hosted messaging assets of critical path  relating to operational knowledge transfer from critical path employees  and  of other expenses  primarily travel related expenses 
also included in the increase in technical operations and development expenses is approximately  related to travel and other expenses 
in addition  for fiscal  we recorded  of stock based compensation as a result of our adoption of sfas r effective january  capitalized personnel costs for employees directly related to the application development stage of development projects decreased by  to  compared to fiscal  which decrease also contributed to the increase in technical operations and development expenses fiscal we expect technical operations and development expenses to increase slightly  in absolute dollars  going forward as our business continues to grow and as we further develop our applications and services 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for managerial and administrative personnel  fees for professional services  public listing expenses  rent and other general corporate expenses 
year ended december  general and administrative increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues general and administrative expenses for the year ended fiscal increased by approximately million  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses is predominantly a result of increased people costs  including contract and outside service costs  of  and a cost of approximately  relating to a severance payment 
the increase also resulted from  of stock based compensation as a result of our adoption of sfas r 
during fiscal  professional fees increased by an amount of  bank charges increased by an amount of  predominantly as a result of the incremental credit card processing fees incurred as a result of the incremental credit card transactions as a result of our acquisition of mailbank 
com inc in june in addition to these amounts  incremental public listing expenses  inclusive of registration and other regulatory filings  accounted for an increase of  in general and administrative costs and increased facility costs amounted to  general and administrative costs increased by an additional  for fiscal as a result of increased costs incurred for business and state taxes  telephone  office supplies and travel expenses  as compared fiscal during fiscal  foreign exchange generated a gain of  compared to a gain of  for fiscal the movement against the us dollar and predominantly the canadian dollar accounted for a gain of  for the year ended december  compared to a gain of  for the year ended december  this gain was offset by the impact of the fair value adjustment on unrealized foreign exchange forward contracts  which for the year ended december  was a net loss of approximately  and for the year ended december   the impact was a net loss of approximately  these increases in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were offset by an amount of  as a result of a decrease in the cost of insurance and a decrease in the provision for bad debts 
we expect general and administrative expenses to continue to increase  in absolute dollars  as our business continues to grow and the impact of a higher canadian dollar  more fully described in the risk factors above  is recognized 
depreciation of property and equipment property and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets 
year ended december  depreciation of property and equipment increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues the decrease in depreciation for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to certain of our older computer software being fully depreciated and not requiring replacement 
amortization of intangible assets year ended december  amortization of intangible assets increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues amortization of intangible assets consists of amounts arising in connection with the acquisition of boardtown corporation in april  from the acquisition of the hosted messaging business of critical path  inc in january  and the acquisition of mailbank

com inc  customers and customer relationships purchased are amortized on a straight line basis over five years other income year ended december  other income expenses  net increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues in  we assigned to an unrelated third party various patents which were acquired by us in the merger with infonautics corporation in in connection with the assignment of these patents  we retained the right to share in certain revenue relating to any cash flow received by such third party relating to the commercialization of these patents 
as a result of this assignment  during fiscal  we recognized million in other revenue 
this amount was fully paid to us during the year 
we do not expect to receive any additional revenue from this arrangement in the future 
other income also includes interest income of  fiscal  compared to  for fiscal interest income is expected to decrease in future periods as we will have lower investment balances available  primarily as a result of the acquisitions we have made this year 
as a result of the promissory notes issued in association with the acquisition of mailbank 
com inc in june  we incurred an interest expense of  during fiscal income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates of our current tax obligations and temporary differences resulting from differences in reporting items for financial statement and tax purposes 
we recognize deferred taxes using the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred taxes are recognized for differences between the accounting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances based on management s judgment are established when appropriate to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
year ended december  recovery of income taxes decrease over prior period decrease percentage percentage of net revenues we operate in various tax jurisdictions  and accordingly  our income is subject to varying rates of tax 
losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot be used to offset income taxes payable in another 
no provision for income taxes was recorded for fiscal and because we had net operating losses to offset against our operating income 
our ability to use income tax loss carryforwards and future income tax deductions is dependant upon our operations in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arise 
we are entitled to certain canadian investment tax credits for qualifying research and development activities performed in canada 
during fiscal  we recorded a tax recovery  net of canadian provincial taxes otherwise payable  in the amount of approximately  representing the actual investment tax credit payment received from the canadian authorities with respect to research and development undertaken in during fiscal  we recorded a tax recovery  net of canadian provincial taxes otherwise payable  in the amount of  representing the actual investment tax credit received from the canadian authorities with respect to research and development undertaken in  and results of operations for the year ended december  as compared to december  the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source year ended december  domain name and other internet services domain names  excluding domain direct other internet services  including domain direct total domain name and other internet services advertising and other revenue increase over prior period increase percentage the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source  as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  domain name and other internet services domain names  excluding domain direct other internet services  including domain direct total domain name and other internet services advertising and other revenue total net revenues for fiscal increased to million from million for fiscal during fiscal  no customer accounted for more than of billed revenue  and one customer accounted for of accounts receivable at december  subsequent to the year end  all of the amounts owed by this customer were collected 
significant management judgment is required at the time of recording of revenue to assess whether the collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
on an ongoing basis we assess the ability of our customers to make required payments 
based on this assessment  we expect the carrying amount of our outstanding receivables  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  to be fully collected 
domain name and other internet services net revenues from domain name and other internet services for fiscal increased by million  or  to million from million for fiscal  primarily as a result of increased volumes from new and existing customers  as well as the additional revenue earned as a result of the april acquisition of boardtown corporation 
this increase occurred despite the fact that during fiscal  our revenue numbers included the recognition of deferred domain name revenue of approximately million that was recognized as a result of one of our resellers becoming an accredited registrar and transferring all of its domain names from our tag to its own tag 
the impact of the transfer of these names  which included a large number of multiple year registrations  resulted in our having no future obligations in connection with these names 
as a result  we recognized all deferred revenue previously recorded relating to these names during fiscal the customer continues to be a customer of ours  using our openhrs platform for its registration needs 
during fiscal  the number of domain names that we processed increased by approximately  to approximately million new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations  compared to fiscal these increases were due primarily to the fact that we continued to compete aggressively to attract new clients and retain existing customers in order to protect our current market share and improve our competitive position 
these actions have resulted in our average selling price declining  which has partially offset the impact of the increased transaction volume on our revenue and profitability 
we may face continued pricing pressure in order to remain competitive  which would adversely impact our revenues and profitability 
the renewal rate for domain name registrations increased to approximately for fiscal compared to approximately for fiscal during fiscal  revenue from domain names  excluding domain direct  comprised of total revenue  compared to for fiscal during fiscal  revenue from other internet services  including domain direct  comprised of total revenue  compared to for fiscal while we anticipate that the number of new  renewed and transferred in domain name registrations will incrementally increase  the volatility in the market could affect the growth of domain names under our management 
during fiscal  the total number of domain names under our management increased by approximately  to approximately million  compared to fiscal as of december  we provided provisioning services to five registrars on a monthly basis  as compared to six registrars at december   who use our technical systems to process domain registrations with their accreditation 
as of december   we managed approximately  domain names  compared to approximately  at december   on their behalf 
deferred revenue from domain name registrations and other internet services at december  increased to approximately million from approximately million at december  advertising and other revenue advertising and other revenue for the years ended december  and remained flat at approximately million primarily due to the improved efficiency that users are experiencing in using our redesigned software download website that we completed during the second quarter of during fiscal  revenue from advertising and other revenue comprised of total revenue  compared to for fiscal cost of revenues cost of revenues includes the costs associated with providing domain registration and other internet services  advertising and other revenue and network costs 
cost of revenues for domain registrations represents the amortization of registry fees on a basis consistent with the recognition of revenues from our customers  namely ratably over the term of provision of the service 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered  and are recorded as prepaid domain registry fees 
costs of revenues for other internet services consist of fees paid to third party service providers and are recognized ratably over the periods in which the services are provided 
we have minimal direct cost of revenues associated with our advertising and other revenues 
therefore  the gross profit margin on advertising revenue is approximately and  accordingly  any increase or decrease in advertising and other revenue represents an increase or a reduction of our gross profit of the same amount 
network costs include personnel and related expenses  including bandwidth and co location expenses to support the supply of all our services 
bandwidth and co location expenses are composed primarily of communication and provisioning costs related to the management and support of our network 
the following table presents our cost of revenue  by revenue source year ended december  domain name and other internet services domain names  excluding domain direct other internet services  including domain direct total domain name and other internet services network  other costs network  depreciation and amortization costs increase over prior period increase percentage the following table presents our revenues  by revenue source  as a percentage of total revenues year ended december  domain name and other internet services domain names  excluding domain direct other internet services  including domain direct total domain name and other internet services network  other costs network  depreciation and amortization costs cost of revenues for fiscal increased by approximately million  or  to million from million for fiscal  primarily as a result of the higher costs attributable to increased volumes of domain registrations and other internet services of million and to the november change in nature of the icann accreditation fee 
this increase was partly offset by the recognition of the non cash prepaid cost of goods recorded during fiscal of approximately  that arose as a result of one of our resellers  as more fully described under net revenue above  becoming an accredited registrar and transferring all of its domain names from our tag to its own tag with the result that we no longer have any future obligations in connection with these names 
registry fees  the primary component of cost of revenues  are paid in full when the domain is registered 
registry fees are recorded as prepaid domain registry fees and are recognized ratably over the term of provision of the service 
other internet service costs and icann accreditation transaction fees are generally paid either monthly or quarterly 
services provided over periods longer than one month are recognized ratably over the term of provision of the service 
effective november   icann s members voted to change the basis whereby registrars pay their variable accreditation fee to a transaction based fee of per domain year registered 
as this fee is now being charged as a transaction fee  we are no longer expensing this fee to sales and marketing  but are allocating it to cost of goods sold and are recognizing it ratably over the term of provision of the service 
we anticipate that cost of revenues will continue to increase in absolute dollars primarily as a result of continued growth in domain registration and other internet services 
during fiscal  direct cost of goods pertaining to domain names  excluding domain direct  comprised of total cost of goods  compared to for fiscal during fiscal  direct cost of goods pertaining to other internet services  including domain direct  comprised of total cost of goods  compared to for fiscal prepaid domain registration and other internet services fees at december  increased by approximately million  to approximately million from approximately million at december  cost of revenues includes the costs of network operations 
these costs for fiscal increased by  or  to  from  for fiscal  primarily as a result of additional people costs resulting from increased headcount and hours of operation  as well as increased network server maintenance and support contract costs 
the cost of network operations is comprised primarily of communication costs  equipment maintenance  and employee and related costs directly associated with the management and maintenance of the network 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs 
these costs include commissions and related expenses of our sales  product management  public relations  call center  support and marketing personnel 
other sales and marketing expenses include customer acquisition costs  advertising and other promotional costs 
year ended december  sales and marketing decrease over prior period decrease percentage percentage of net revenues sales and marketing expenses during fiscal decreased by approximately  or  to approximately million compared to approximately million during fiscal the decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in icann fees  which decreased by approximately  due to this expense now being included under cost of goods sold as discussed under cost of revenues above 
in addition  personnel costs increased primarily as a result of additional personnel in sales and product management by approximately  this increase was net of an amount of approximately  recorded during fiscal in connection with the at risk incentive compensation plan 
no accrual has been recorded for fiscal as management has determined that we did not exceed the performance thresholds set by the compensation committee for senior managers and executive officers in our at risk incentive compensation plan 
this increase was also as a result of incremental expenses of approximately  incurred during fiscal as a result of additional marketing  supplies and other miscellaneous expenses 
this was slightly offset by a decrease in travel expenses of approximately  for fiscal as a result of less travel undertaken during the year 
technical operations and development technical operations and development expenses consist primarily of personnel costs and related expenses required to support the development of new or enhanced service offerings and the maintenance and upgrading of existing infrastructure 
this includes expenses incurred in the research  design and development of technology that we use to register domain names and other internet services and to distribute our digital content services 
editorial costs relating to the rating and review of the software content libraries are included in the costs of product development 
in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  costs incurred during the application development stage are capitalized and primarily include personnel costs for employees directly related to the development project 
all other costs are expensed as incurred 
year ended december  technical operations and development increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues technical operations and development expenses for fiscal increased approximately million  or  to approximately million from approximately million for fiscal the increase was primarily the result of people related costs including contract and outside service costs  which increased by approximately million includes a cost of approximately  relating to a severance payment and reflects our ongoing commitment to enhance and extend our opensrs platform 
no accrual was included under technical operations and development expenses during fiscal for our at risk incentive compensation plan as management has determined that we did not exceed the performance thresholds set by the compensation committee for senior managers and executive officers under the plan compared to approximately  included for fiscal under the at risk incentive compensation plan 
also included in the increase in technical operations and development expenses is an increase of approximately  related to travel and other expenses 
these amounts were partly offset by a decrease in technical operations and development expenses due to a decrease in stock based compensation of approximately  this cost was incurred during fiscal  as a result of a change to the terms of the options granted to one of our former officers 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for managerial and administrative personnel  fees for professional services  public listing expenses  rent and other general corporate expenses 
year ended december  general and administrative increase over prior period increase percentage percentage of net revenues general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by approximately  or  to million from million for fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses generally reflects the more sophisticated infrastructure needed to support the constantly evolving needs we experience as the size and scope of our business continues to grow 
this resulted in increases in provision for doubtful accounts of approximately  increases in facility costs of approximately  and increases in public listing expenses  professional fees  telephone and supplies totaling approximately  includes an incremental cost of  related to an outside management consultant 
we also recorded a foreign exchange gain of approximately  for fiscal compared to approximately  for fiscal  reflecting the continued strengthening in the canadian dollar 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in people costs  including contract and outside services of approximately  this decrease in people costs reflects increases in people costs to support our growth being offset by our not including an accrual under general and administrative expenses during fiscal for our at risk incentive compensation plan as management has determined that we did not exceed the performance thresholds set by the compensation committee for senior managers and executive officers under the plan compared to approximately  included for fiscal under the at risk incentive compensation plan 
directors and officers liability insurance  business and state taxes travel and other miscellaneous expenses also decreased by a total of approximately  during fiscal compared to fiscal depreciation of property and equipment property and equipment is depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the assets 
year ended december  depreciation of property and equipment decrease over prior period decrease percentage percentage of net revenues the decrease in depreciation fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to certain of our older computer software being fully depreciated and not requiring replacement 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets consists of amounts arising in connection with the acquisition of boardtown corporation in april the technology  brand and customer relationships purchased are amortized on a straight line basis over seven years  while the non competition agreements entered into with the former owners of boardtown corporation are amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
year ended december  amortization of intangible assets other income year ended december  other income expenses  net other income includes net interest income of approximately  for the year ended december  and approximately  for the year ended december  in  we assigned to an unrelated third party our partner  various patents which were acquired by us in the merger with infonautics in in connection with the assignment of these patents  we retained the right to a revenue share relating to any cash flow received by our partner relating to the commercialization of these patents 
as a result of this assignment  during fiscal  we recognized  in other revenue 
this amount was fully paid to us during the year 
during fiscal  we recognized million in other revenue as a result of this assignment

income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we make estimates of our current tax obligations and temporary differences resulting from differences in reporting items for financial statement and tax purposes 
we recognize deferred taxes by the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances based on management s judgment are established when appropriate to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
year ended december  recovery of income taxes we operate in various tax jurisdictions  and accordingly  our income is subject to varying rates of tax 
losses incurred in one jurisdiction cannot be used to offset income taxes payable in another 
no provision for income taxes was recorded for fiscal and because we had net operating losses to offset against our operating income 
our ability to use income tax loss carryforwards and future income tax deductions is dependant upon our operations in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arise 
we are entitled to certain canadian investment tax credits for qualifying research and development activities performed in canada 
during fiscal  we recorded a tax recovery  net of canadian provincial taxes otherwise payable  in the amount of approximately  representing the actual investment tax credit payment received from the canadian authorities with respect to research and development undertaken in  and quarterly results the following table summarizes selected unaudited quarterly financial data for the past eight quarters tucows inc quarterly results of operations dollar amounts in us dollars three months ended march  june  september  december  unaudited net revenues income loss from operations net income loss for the period basic and diluted income per share shares used in computing basic income per common share shares used in computing diluted income per common share march  june  september  december  unaudited net revenues income from operations net income for the period basic and diluted income per share shares used in computing basic income per common share shares used in computing diluted income per common share liquidity and capital resources at december   our principal source of liquidity was cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of approximately million compared to approximately million at december   a decrease of approximately million 
net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal operating activities  after adjustment for non cash and other items including depreciation  amortization  change in the fair value of forward contracts and stock based compensation of million  for fiscal generated million 
changes in non cash operating working capital provided an additional million 
the increase in non cash operating working capital primarily reflects changes in deferred revenue  which in turn is offset by changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable  accrued expenses  and prepaid domain name registry fees 
the increase in accounts receivable resulted primarily from our recent acquisition of the hosted messaging assets from critical path 
in october  we migrated the email accounts acquired in the mailbank 
com inc transaction to our hosted email platform 
as a result of service degradations experienced by these customers during the conversion process  we determined that it would be appropriate to extend the service period of all these customers by days 
accordingly  this impacted the timing of renewal cash flow by days and resulted in a decrease in cash flows of approximately  during the quarter ended december  as this billed revenue would have been deferred and then recognized over the period that service is provided  our current deferred revenue pertaining to these customers will be recognized over the extended period 
the impact of this sales credit on recognized revenue is not expected to have a material impact in any reporting period 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for fiscal this resulted primarily from the cash amounts paid for the acquisition of mailbank 
com inc on june  for million and the purchase of the hosted messaging assets of critical path  inc for million on january  in addition  in connection with the acquisition of the hosted messaging assets we placed an additional million into escrow to meet our obligation to pay additional cash payments to critical path inc if certain performance targets were met 
as a result of performance targets being met  million was released from escrow in august and  was released from escrow to tucows and an additional  was released from escrow in december in january  the final  was released from escrow and paid to critical path together with their share of interest earned on the monies in escrow 
in connection with the acquisition of mailbank 
com inc in june  we issued two unsecured promissory notes  the first for  bearing interest at per annum  and the second for  bearing interest at per annum 
interest on the first note was payable quarterly in arrears  beginning october   with the principal payable on september  the second note was repaid in full by tucows in august  and primarily resulted in million of net cash used for financing activities for fiscal this million repayment was partly offset by proceeds received on the exercise of stock options under our employee stock options plan in the amount of  we also invested million in property and equipment  primarily in internet services infrastructure 
these investments were made primarily for two reasons 
first we wanted to position ourselves to take advantage of hosted email opportunities that materialized earlier than we expected  which investments included accelerating a successful re architecture of our hosted email environment as well as the purchase of a significant number of additional hosted email licenses from critical path 
inc second  in response to a severe denial of service attack to which we were subject to in early may  which attack impacted a variety of the services on our network  we decided to both accelerate the timing of  and increase the investment in an improved managed dns infrastructure in order to better insulate ourselves against future attacks 
third  we experienced a significant increase in inbound spam and assessed that we needed to invest incrementally in our hosted email environment 
in addition  as of december  we held million in restricted cash as additional margin security against forward exchange contracts to which we are party 
based on our operations  we believe that our cash flow from operations will be adequate to meet our anticipated requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
we may choose to raise additional funds or seek other financing arrangements to facilitate more rapid expansion to develop new or enhance existing products or services  to respond to competitive pressures or to acquire or invest in complementary businesses  technologies  services or products 
if additional financing is required  we may not be able to raise it on acceptable terms  or at all  and additional financing may be dilutive to existing investors 
we may also evaluate potential acquisitions of other businesses  products and technologies 
to complete potential acquisitions  we may issue additional securities or need additional equity or debt financing and any additional financing may be dilutive to existing investors 
there are currently no material understandings  commitments or agreements about any acquisition of other businesses 
subsequent event in february  the company purchased million shares were purchased under the stock buyback program at per share 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations we have not entered into any off balance sheet financial arrangements and have not established any special purpose entities as of december  nor have we guaranteed any debt or commitment of other entities 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  is presented in the table below 
purchase obligations include amounts committed under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations note payable total see additional discussion under quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in connection with the forward foreign exchange contracts that we entered into in december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in canada and sell these products in north america and europe 
our sales are primarily made in us dollars  while a major portion of expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of canadian and us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
based on the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material interest rate risk exposure at december  although we have a functional currency of us dollars  a substantial portion of our fixed expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
our policy with respect to foreign currency exposure is to manage financial exposure to certain foreign exchange fluctuations with the objective of neutralizing some of the impact of foreign currency exchange movements 
accordingly  we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate the exchange rate risk on portions of our canadian dollar exposure 
these contracts  entered into in november will be utilized over the year ending december  such foreign exchange forward contracts have not been treated as hedges for accounting purposes as we have not complied with the documentation requirements 
we have accounted for the fair value of the derivative instruments within the consolidated balance sheet as a derivative financial asset or liability and the corresponding change in fair value is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have no other freestanding or embedded derivative instruments 
the impact of the fair value adjustment on unrealized foreign exchange forward contracts for fiscal was a net loss of approximately  and for fiscal  the impact was a net loss of approximately  which is reflected on the consolidated statements of operations in general and administrative expenses 
as of december   we had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts totaling million  with exchange rates varying from us to cdn to us to cdn 
on november   tucows entered into a series of forward foreign exchange contracts with a notional value of million  whereby  is converted into canadian dollars on a semi monthly basis for the twelve months ended december at foreign exchange rates varying from us cdn to us cdn 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis model for foreign exchange exposure over fiscal the analysis used a modeling technique that compares the us dollar equivalent of all expenses incurred in canadian dollars  at the actual exchange rate  to a hypothetical adverse movement in the foreign currency exchange rates against the us dollar  with all other variables held constant 
foreign currency exchange rates used were based on the market rates in effect during fiscal the sensitivity analysis indicated that a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates would result in a decrease in net income for fiscal of approximately million 
there can be no assurances that the above projected exchange rate decrease will materialize 
fluctuations of exchange rates are beyond the actions to hedge or mitigate these risks
