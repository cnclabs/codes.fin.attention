see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for additional financial information about our business segments as well as information about our geographic operations 
the company was incorporated in delaware in certain predecessor businesses which now constitute part of the company have been in business since our headquarters office is located at harbor park drive  port washington  new york 
products we offer more than  brand name and private label products 
we endeavor to expand and keep current the breadth of our product offerings in order to fulfill the increasingly wide range of product needs of our customers 
our computer sales include systemax and ultra pcs as well as offerings of other brand name pcs  servers and notebook computers 
computer supplies and consumer electronics related products include supplies such as laser printer toner cartridges and ink jet printer cartridges  media such as recordable disks and magnetic tape cartridges  peripherals such as hard disks  cd rom and dvd drives  printers and scanners  memory upgrades  data communication and networking equipment  monitors  digital cameras  plasma and lcd tvs  mp and dvd players  pda s  and packaged software 
we assemble our systemax and ultra brand pcs in our  square foot  iso certified facility in fletcher  ohio 
we purchase components and subassemblies from suppliers in the united states as well as overseas 
certain parts and components for our pcs are obtained from a limited group of suppliers 
we also utilize licensed technology and computer software in the assembly of our pcs 
for a discussion of risks associated with these licenses and suppliers  see item a  risk factors 
our industrial products include storage equipment such as wire and metal shelving  bins and lockers  light material handling equipment such as hand carts  forklifts and hand trucks  ladders  furniture  small office machines and related supplies  and consumable industrial products such as first aid items  safety items  protective clothing and osha compliance items 
we began to market our pcs profitcenter software suite of business applications in pcs profitcenter software is a web based application which is delivered as an on demand service over the internet 
the product helps companies automate and manage their entire customer life cycle across multiple sales channels internet  call centers  outside salespersons  etc we have not recognized any significant revenues for this service to date 
sales and marketing we market our products to both business customers and individual consumers 
our business customers include for profit businesses educational organizations and government entities 
we have developed a proprietary customer and prospect database 
we consider our business customers to include the various individuals who work within an organization rather than just the business itself 
we have established a three pronged system of direct marketing to business customers  consisting of relationship marketers  catalog mailings and propriety internet web sites  the combination of which is designed to maximize sales 
our relationship marketers focus their efforts on our business customers by establishing a personal relationship between such customers and a systemax account manager 
the goal of the relationship marketing sales force is to increase the purchasing productivity of current customers and to actively solicit newly targeted prospects to become customers 
with access to the records we maintain of historical purchasing patterns  our relationship marketers are prompted with product suggestions to expand customer order values 
in the united states  we also have the ability to provide such customers with electronic data interchange edi ordering and customized billing services  customer savings reports and stocking of specialty items specifically requested by these customers 
our relationship marketers efforts are supported by frequent catalog mailings and e mail campaigns both of which are designed to generate inbound telephone sales  and our interactive websites  which allow customers to purchase products directly over the internet 
we believe that the integration of these three marketing methods enables us to more thoroughly penetrate our business and government customer base 
increased internet exposure can lead to more internet related sales and can also generate more inbound telephone sales  just as catalog mailings and email campaigns which feature our websites can result in greater internet related sales 
our growth in net sales continues to be supported by strong growth in sales to individual consumers  particularly through e commerce means 
to reach our consumer audience  we use methods such as website campaigns  banner ads and e mail campaigns 
we are able to monitor and evaluate the results of our various advertising campaigns to enable us to execute them in a cost effective manner 
as part of our marketing strategy we advertise manufacturers mail in rebates on many products we sell and  in some cases  offer our own rebates 
we combine our use of e commerce initiatives with catalog mailings  which generate calls to inbound sales representatives 
these sales representatives use our information systems to fulfill orders and explore additional customer product needs 
sales to consumers are generally fulfilled from our own stock  requiring us to carry more inventory than we would for our business customers 
we also periodically take advantage of attractive product pricing by making opportunistic bulk inventory purchases with the objective of turning them quickly into sales 
we have also successfully increased our sales to individual consumers by using retail outlet stores 
we currently have eight such retail locations in north america and we have four in europe  which are located in or near one of our existing sales and distribution centers  thereby minimizing our operating costs 
we presently plan to add four more retail locations in e commerce the worldwide growth in active internet users has made e commerce a significant opportunity for sales growth 
in  we had approximately million in internet related sales  an increase of million  or  from e commerce sales represented of total revenue in  compared to in the increase in our internet related sales enables us to leverage our advertising spending  allowing us to reduce our printed catalog costs while maintaining customer contact 
we currently operate multiple e commerce sites  including www

globalindustrial 
com  and we continually upgrade the capabilities and performance of these web sites 
our internet sites feature on line catalogs of thousands of products  allowing us to offer a wider variety of computer and industrial products than our printed catalogs 
our customers have around the clock  on line access to purchase products and we have the ability to create targeted promotions for our customers interests 
many of our internet sites also permit customers to purchase build to order pcs configured to their own specifications 
in addition to our own e commerce web sites  we have partnering agreements with several of the largest internet shopping and search engine providers who feature our products on their web sites or provide click throughs from their sites directly to ours 
these arrangements allow us to expand our customer base at an economical cost 
catalogs we currently produce a total of full line and targeted specialty catalogs in north america and europe under distinct titles 
our portfolio of catalogs includes such established brand names as tigerdirect 
com  global computer supplies  misco  hcs misco  global industrial  arrowstar and 
full line computer product catalogs offer products such as pcs  notebooks  peripherals  computer components  magnetic media  data communication  networking and power protection equipment  ergonomic accessories  furniture and software 
full line industrial product catalogs offer products such as material handling products and industrial supplies 
specialty catalogs contain more focused product offerings and are targeted to individuals most likely to purchase from such catalogs 
we mail catalogs to both businesses and consumers 
in the case of business mailings  we mail our catalogs to many individuals at a single business location  providing us with multiple points of entry 
our in house staff designs all of our catalogs 
in house catalog production helps reduce overall catalog expense and shortens catalog production time 
this allows us the flexibility to alter our product offerings and pricing and to refine our catalog formats more quickly 
our catalogs are printed by third parties under fixed pricing arrangements 
the commonality of certain core pages of our catalogs also allows for economies in catalog production 
as noted above  the increase in our internet related sales allowed us to reduce the distribution of our catalogs to million  which was fewer than in the prior year 
we mailed approximately million catalogs in north america  a reduction from last year and approximately million catalogs  or fewer than  were distributed in europe 
customer service  order fulfillment and support we generally provide toll free telephone number access to our customers 
certain of our domestic call centers are linked to provide telephone backup in the event of a disruption in phone service 
in addition to telephone orders  we also receive orders by mail  fax  electronic data interchange and through the internet 
a large number of our products are carried in stock  and orders for such products are fulfilled on a timely basis directly from our distribution centers  typically on the day the order is received 
we operate out of multiple sales and distribution facilities in north america and europe 
the locations of our distribution centers enable us to provide our customers next day or second day delivery 
orders are generally shipped by third party delivery services in the united states and in europe 
the locations of our distribution centers in europe have enabled us to market into four additional countries with limited incremental investment 
we maintain relationships with a number of large distributors in north america and europe that also deliver products directly to our customers 
we provide extensive technical telephone support to our systemax brand pc customers 
we maintain a database of commonly asked questions for our technical support representatives  enabling them to respond quickly to similar questions 
we conduct regular on site training seminars for our sales representatives to help ensure that they are well trained and informed regarding our latest product offerings 
suppliers we purchase the majority of our products and components directly from manufacturers and large wholesale distributors 
for the year ended december   ingram micro accounted for of our purchases 
for the year ended december   no vendor accounted for more than of our purchases 
for the year ended december   tech data corporation accounted for and ingram micro inc accounted for of our purchases 
the loss of either of these vendors  or any other key vendors  could have an adverse effect on us 
certain private label products are manufactured by third parties to our specifications 
many of these private label products have been designed or developed by our in house product design and development teams 
competition and other market factors technology products the north american and european computer markets are highly competitive  with many us  asian and european companies vying for market share 
there are few barriers of entry to the pc market  with pcs being sold through the direct market channel  mass merchants  over the internet and by computer and office supply superstores 
timely introduction of new products or product features are critical elements to remaining competitive in the pc market 
other competitive factors include product performance  quality and reliability  technical support and customer service  marketing and distribution and price 
some of our competitors have stronger brand recognition  broader product lines and greater financial  marketing  manufacturing and technological resources than us 
additionally  our results could also be adversely affected should we be unable to maintain our technological and marketing arrangements with other companies  such as microsoft  intel and advanced micro devices 
the north american computer related products market is highly fragmented and characterized by multiple channels of distribution including direct marketers  local and national retail computer stores  computer resellers  mass merchants  computer and office supply superstores and internet based resellers 
in europe  our major competitors are regional or country specific retail and direct mail distribution companies and internet based resellers 
with conditions in the market for computer related products remaining highly competitive  continued reductions in retail prices may adversely affect our revenues and profits 
additionally  we rely in part upon the introduction of new technologies and products by other manufacturers in order to sustain long term sales growth and profitability 
there is no assurance that the rapid rate of such technological advances and product development will continue 
industrial products the market for the sale of industrial products in north america is highly fragmented and is characterized by multiple distribution channels such as retail outlets  small dealerships  direct mail distribution  internet based resellers and large warehouse stores 
we also face competition from manufacturers own sales representatives  who sell industrial equipment directly to customers  and from regional or local distributors 
many high volume purchasers  however  utilize catalog distributors as their first source of product 
in the industrial products market  customer purchasing decisions are primarily based on price  product selection  product availability  level of service and convenience 
we believe that direct marketing via catalog  the internet and sales representatives is an effective and convenient distribution method to reach mid sized facilities that place many small orders and require a wide selection of products 
in addition  because the industrial products market is highly fragmented and generally less brand oriented  it is well suited to private label products 
employees as of december   we employed a total of  employees  including  full time and part time employees  of whom  were in north america and  were in europe 
environmental matters under various national  state and local environmental laws and regulations in north america and europe  a current or previous owner or operator including the lessee of real property may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous substances at such real property 
such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to fault 
we lease most of our facilities 
in connection with such leases  we could be held liable for the costs of removal or remedial actions with respect to hazardous substances 
although we have not been notified of  and are not otherwise aware of  any material environmental liability  claim or non compliance  there can be no assurance that we will not be required to incur remediation or other costs in connection with environmental matters in the future

risk factors 
there are a number of factors and variables described below that may affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
other factors of which we are currently not aware or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our results of operations and financial position 
risks related to our industry economic conditions have affected and could continue to adversely affect our revenues and profits 
both we and our customers are subject to global political  economic and market conditions  including inflation  interest rates  energy costs  the impact of natural disasters  military action and the threat of terrorism 
our consolidated results of operations are directly affected by economic conditions in north america and europe 
we may experience a decline in sales as a result of poor economic conditions and the lack of visibility relating to future orders 
our results of operations depend upon  among other things  our ability to maintain and increase sales volumes with existing customers  our ability to attract new customers and the financial condition of our customers 
a decline in the economy that adversely affects our customers  causing them to limit or defer their spending  would likely adversely affect us as well 
we cannot predict with any certainty whether we will be able to maintain or improve upon historical sales volumes with existing customers  or whether we will be able to attract new customers 
in response to economic and market conditions  from time to time we have undertaken initiatives to reduce our cost structure where appropriate 
the initiatives already implemented as well as any future workforce and facilities reductions undertaken may not be sufficient to meet the changes in economic and market conditions and to achieve future profitability 
in addition  costs actually incurred in connection with our restructuring actions may be higher than our estimates of such costs and or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings 
increased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may impact our results of operations 
as a public company  we incur significant legal  accounting and other expenses that we would not incur as a private company 
in addition  the sarbanes oxley act of  as well as rules subsequently implemented by the securities and exchange commission and listing requirements subsequently adopted by the new york stock exchange in response to sarbanes oxley  have required changes in corporate governance practices of public companies 
these developments have already substantially increased our legal compliance  auditing and financial reporting costs and made them more time consuming 
we anticipate that the company will be subject to the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act as of december   and that costs will further increase and make some compliance activities more time consuming 
these developments may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain directors and officers liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage  possibly making it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors  particularly to serve on our audit committee 
we presently cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result of the implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act  however  to the extent these costs are significant  our general and administrative expenses are likely to increase as a percentage of revenue and our results of operations will be negatively impacted 
competitive pressures could harm our revenue and gross margin 
we may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and subject to constant technological change 
we expect this competition to further intensify in the future 
competitive factors include price  availability  service and support 
we compete with a wide variety of other resellers and retailers  as well as manufacturers 
some of our competitors are larger companies with greater financial  marketing and product development resources than ours 
in addition  new competitors may enter our markets 
this may place us at a disadvantage in responding to competitors pricing strategies  technological advances and other initiatives  resulting in our inability to increase our revenues or maintain our gross margins in the future 
in many cases our products compete directly with those offered by other manufacturers and distributors 
if any of our competitors were to develop products or services that are more cost effective or technically superior  demand for our product offerings could decrease 
our gross margins are also dependent on the mix of products we sell and could be adversely affected by a continuation of our customers shift to lower priced products 
as do most other companies in the technology products industry  we advertise manufacturers mail in rebates on many products we sell and  in some cases  offer our own rebates 
we process these rebates through third party vendors and in house 
if we are unable to fulfill these rebates in a timely and satisfactory manner  our reputation in the marketplace could be negatively impacted 
state and local sales tax collection may affect demand for our products 
our united states subsidiaries collect and remit sales tax in states in which the subsidiaries have physical presence or in which we believe nexus exists which obligates us to collect sales tax 
other states may  from time to time  claim that we have state related activities constituting a sufficient nexus to require such collection 
additionally  many other states seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on companies that sell goods to customers in their state  or directly to the state and its political subdivisions  even without a physical presence 
such efforts by states have increased recently  as states seek to raise revenues without increasing the tax burden on residents 
we rely on united states supreme court decisions which hold that  without congressional authority  a state may not enforce a sales tax collection obligation on a company that has no physical presence in the state and whose only contacts with the state are through the use of interstate commerce such as the mailing of catalogs into the state and the delivery of goods by mail or common carrier 
we cannot predict whether the nature or level of contacts we have with a particular state will be deemed enough to require us to collect sales tax in that state nor can we be assured that congress or individual states will not approve legislation authorizing states to impose tax collection obligations on all direct mail and or e commerce transactions 
a successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales tax on the sale of merchandise could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales and would result in considerable administrative burdens and costs for us and may reduce demand for our products from customers in such states when we charge customers for such taxes 
business disruptions could adversely impact our revenue and financial condition 
we insure for certain property and casualty risks consisting primarily of physical loss to property  business interruptions resulting from property losses  workers compensation  comprehensive general liability  and auto liability 
insurance coverage is obtained for catastrophic property and casualty exposures as well as those risks required to be insured by law or contract 
although we believe that our insurance coverage is reasonable  significant events such as acts of war and terrorism  economic conditions  judicial decisions  legislation  natural disasters and large losses could materially affect our insurance obligations and future expense 
changes in financial accounting standards may affect our results of operations 
a change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results of operations 
new accounting pronouncements and interpretations of existing accounting rules and practices have occurred and may occur in the future 
changes to existing rules  such as the implementation of financial accounting standard board interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 may adversely affect our reported financial results 
fin which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of this pronouncement 
risks related to our company we may not be able to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of for the year ended december   we were not subject to the internal controls certification and attestation requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of because we were not an accelerated filer as defined by the sec 
for the year ended december   we will be subject to the requirements of section that management provide an assessment of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting and the company s independent registered public accounting firm will be required to audit that assessment 
we are working to achieve compliance with the requirements of section we will be dedicating substantial time and resources to documentation and review of our procedures and we will have to devote substantial time and resources to this effort in we may also need to engage outside consultants to assist us 
we have not completed this process or its assessment  due to the complexities of our decentralized structure  the number of accounting systems in use  and the lack of qualified personnel to devote to the process 
in addition to the significant deficiencies reported as of december  discussed under the caption disclosure controls and procedures in item a 
controls and procedures  we have identified numerous other internal control deficiencies that may affect the timeliness and accuracy of recording transactions and which  individually or in the aggregate  could become material weaknesses in future periods if not remediated 
if we are not successful in complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  we could lose the confidence of our investors 
in the past we have been late filing our required financial reports 
any such delays in the future could affect the trading of our stock 
we were late in the filing of our quarterly and annual reports and our quarterly reports required under the securities exchange act of failure to file required reports on a timely basis could result in the de listing of the company s common stock by the new york stock exchange 
if we do not file our required annual and quarterly financial statements in the prescribed time frames we would also be ineligible to file certain registration statements and could be subject to sec enforcement action 
our success is dependent upon the availability of credit and financing 
we require significant levels of capital in our business to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we maintain credit facilities in the united states and in europe to finance increases in our working capital if available cash is insufficient 
the amount of credit available to us at any point in time may be adversely affected by the quality or value of the assets collateralizing these credit lines 
in addition  if we are unable to renew or replace these facilities at maturity our liquidity and capital resources may be adversely affected 
however  we currently have no reason to believe that we will not be able to renew or replace our facilities when they reach maturity 
we have substantial international operations and we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates and political uncertainties 
we operate internationally and as a result  we are subject to risks associated with doing business globally 
risks inherent to operating overseas include changes in a country s economic or political conditions changes in foreign currency exchange rates difficulties with staffing and managing international operations unexpected changes in regulatory requirements for example  we currently have operations located in nine countries outside the united states  and non us sales europe and canada accounted for of our revenue during to the extent the us dollar strengthens against the euro and british pound  our european revenues and profits will be reduced when translated into us dollars 
sales to individual consumers exposes us to credit card fraud  which could adversely affect our business 
failure to adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions could increase our expenses 
increased sales to individual consumers  which are more likely to be paid for using a credit card  increases our exposure to fraud 
we employ technology solutions to help us detect the fraudulent use of credit card information 
however  if we are unable to detect or control credit card fraud  we may in the future suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data  which could adversely affect our business 
we are exposed to inventory risks 
a substantial portion of our inventory is subject to risk due to technological change and changes in market demand for particular products 
if we fail to manage our inventory of older products we may have excess or obsolete inventory 
we may have limited rights to return purchases to certain suppliers and we may not be able to obtain price protection on these items 
the elimination of purchase return privileges and lack of availability of price protection could lower our gross margin or result in inventory write downs 
we also take advantage of attractive product pricing by making opportunistic bulk inventory purchases  any resulting excess and or obsolete inventory that we are not able to re sell could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
any inability to make such bulk inventory purchases may significantly impact our sales and profitability 
our income tax rate and the value of our deferred tax assets are subject to change 
changes in our income tax expense due to changes in the mix of us and non us revenues and profitability  changes in tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates  changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes in tax laws or by material audit assessments 
the carrying value of our deferred tax assets  which are primarily in the united states and the united kingdom  is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income in those jurisdictions 
our united kingdom deferred tax assets currently have a full valuation allowance 
in addition  the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions and a material assessment by a tax authority could affect our profitability 
our reliance on information and communications technology requires significant expenditures and entails risk 
we rely on a variety of information and telecommunications systems in our operations 
our success is dependent in large part on the accuracy and proper use of our information systems  including our telecommunications systems 
to manage our growth  we continually evaluate the adequacy of our existing systems and procedures 
we anticipate that we will regularly need to make capital expenditures to upgrade and modify our management information systems  including software and hardware  as we grow and the needs of our business change 
the occurrence of a significant system failure  electrical or telecommunications outages or our failure to expand or successfully implement new systems could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our information systems networks  including our web sites  and applications could be adversely affected by viruses or worms and may be vulnerable to malicious acts such as hacking 
although we take preventive measures  these procedures may not be sufficient to avoid harm to our operations  which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are dependent on third party suppliers 
we purchase a significant portion of our computer products from major distributors such as tech data corporation and ingram micro inc and directly from large manufacturers such as hewlett packard and acer  who may deliver those products directly to our customers 
these relationships enable us to make available to our customers a wide selection of products without having to maintain large amounts of inventory 
the termination or interruption of our relationships with any of these suppliers could materially adversely affect our business 
our pc products contain electronic components  subassemblies and software that in some cases are supplied through sole or limited source third party suppliers  some of which are located outside of the us although we do not anticipate any problems procuring supplies in the near term  there can never be any assurance that parts and supplies will be available in a timely manner and at reasonable prices 
any loss of  or interruption of supply  from key suppliers may require us to find new suppliers 
this could result in production or development delays while new suppliers are located  which could substantially impair operating results 
if the availability of these or other components used in the manufacture of our products was to decrease  or if the prices for these components were to increase significantly  operating costs and expenses could be adversely affected 
we purchase a number of our products from vendors outside of the united states 
difficulties encountered by one or several of these suppliers could halt or disrupt production and delay completion or cause the cancellation of our orders 
delays or interruptions in the transportation network could result in loss or delay of timely receipt of product required to fulfill customer orders 
many product suppliers provide us with co op advertising support in exchange for featuring their products in our catalogs and on our internet sites 
certain suppliers provide us with other incentives such as rebates  reimbursements  payment discounts  price protection and other similar arrangements 
these incentives are offset against cost of goods sold or selling  general and administrative expenses  as applicable 
the level of co op advertising support and other incentives received from suppliers may decline in the future  which could increase our cost of goods sold or selling  general and administrative expenses and have an adverse effect on results of operations and cash flows 
we may encounter risks in connection with sales of our web hosted software application 
in  we introduced our web based and hosted  on demand software suite of products  marketed as pcs profitcenter software 
we have a limited operating history with this type of product offering and may encounter risks inherent in the software industry  including but not limited to failure to implement effective general and application controls errors or security flaws in our product technical difficulties which we can not resolve on a timely or cost effective basis  inability to provide the level of service we commit to inability to deliver product upgrades and enhancements delays in development inability to hire and retain qualified technical personnel impact of privacy laws on the use of our product exposure to claims of infringement of intellectual property rights restrictions and covenants in our credit facility may limit our ability to enter into certain transactions 
our united states united kingdom combined revolving credit agreement contains covenants restricting or limiting our ability to  among other things incur additional debt create or permit liens on assets make capital expenditures or investments pay dividends if we fail to comply with the covenants and other requirements set forth in the agreement  we will have to negotiate a waiver agreement with the lenders 
failure to enter into such a waiver agreement could adversely affect the availability of financing to us which could materially impact our operations 
other factors that may affect our future results of operations and financial condition include  but are not limited to  unanticipated developments in any one or more of the following areas  as well as other factors which may be detailed from time to time in our securities and exchange commission filings the effect on us of volatility in the price of paper and periodic increases in postage rates significant changes in the computer products retail industry  especially relating to the distribution and sale of such products timely availability of existing and new products risks involved with e commerce  including possible loss of business and customer dissatisfaction if outages or other computer related problems should preclude customer access to us risks associated with delivery of merchandise to customers by utilizing common delivery services such as the united states postal service and united parcel service  including possible strikes and contamination borrowing costs or availability pending or threatened litigation and investigations the availability of key personnel readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward looking statements contained in this report  which speak only as of the date of this report

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a direct marketer of brand name and private label products 
our operations are organized in two primary reportable segments technology products and industrial products 
our technology products segment markets personal desktop computers  notebook computers and computer supplies and consumer electronics related products in north america and europe 
we assemble our own pcs and sell them under our own trademarks  which we believe gives us a competitive advantage 
we also sell personal computers manufactured by other leading companies 
our industrial products segment markets material handling equipment  storage equipment and consumable industrial items in north america 
we offer more than  products and continuously update our product offerings to address the needs of our customers  which include large  mid sized and small businesses  educational and government entities as well as individual consumers 
we reach customers by multiple channels  utilizing relationship marketers  e commerce web sites  mailed catalogues and retail outlet stores 
we also participate in the emerging market for on demand  web based software applications through the marketing of our pcs profitcenter software suite of hosted software  which we began during  and in which we have not yet recognized significant revenues and have incurred considerable losses to date 
technology products related products account for of our net sales  and  as a result  we are dependent on the general demand for information technology products and consumer electronics 
the market for computer products is subject to intense price competition and is characterized by narrow gross profit margins 
the north american industrial products market is highly fragmented and we compete against multiple distribution channels 
distribution of information technology and our industrial products is working capital intensive  requiring us to incur significant costs associated with the warehousing of many products  including the costs of leasing warehouse space  maintaining inventory and inventory management systems  and employing personnel to perform the associated tasks 
we supplement our on hand product availability by maintaining relationships with major distributors and manufacturers  utilizing a combination of stocking and drop shipment fulfillment 
the primary component of our operating expenses historically has been employee related costs  which includes items such as wages  commissions  bonuses  and employee benefits 
we have made substantial reductions in our workforce and closed or consolidated several facilities over the past several years 
in response to poor economic conditions in the united states  we implemented a plan in the first quarter of to streamline our united states computer business 
this plan consolidated duplicative back office and warehouse operations  which resulted in annual savings of approximately million excluding severance and other restructuring costs of approximately million  which were recognized in fiscal with evidence of a prolonged economic downturn in europe  we took measures to align our cost structure with expected potentially lower revenues and decreasing gross margins  initiating several cost reduction plans there during and actions taken in to increase efficiency and profitability in our european operations resulted in the elimination of approximately positions  and resulted in approximately million in annual savings excluding severance and restructuring costs of approximately million  which were recognized in fiscal our restructuring actions and other cost savings measures implemented over the last several years resulted in reducing our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses from of net sales in to of net sales in we will continue to monitor our costs and evaluate the need for additional actions 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the policies below have been identified as critical to our business operations and understanding the results of operations 
certain accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty  and as a result  actual results could differ from those estimates 
these judgments are based on historical experience  observation of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
management believes that full consideration has been given to all relevant circumstances that we may be subject to  and the consolidated financial statements of the company accurately reflect management s best estimate of the consolidated results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company for the years presented 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions 
revenue recognition 
we recognize product sales when persuasive evidence of an order arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met at the time of receipt by customers when title and risk of loss both are transferred 
sales are shown net of returns and allowances  rebates and sales incentives 
reserves for estimated returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded  based on historical experience and current trends 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors  including an analysis of the age of customer accounts and our historical experience with accounts receivable write offs 
the analysis also includes the financial condition of a specific customer or industry  and general economic conditions 
in circumstances where we are aware of customer charge backs or a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific reserve for bad debts applicable to amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount management reasonably believes will be collected is recorded 
in those situations with ongoing discussions  the amount of bad debt recognized is based on the status of the discussions 
while bad debt allowances have been within expectations and the provisions established  there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same allowance rate we have in the past 
inventories 
we value our inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
reserves for excess and obsolete or unmarketable merchandise are provided based on historical experience  assumptions about future product demand and market conditions 
if market conditions are less favorable than projected or if technological developments result in accelerated obsolescence  additional write downs may be required 
while obsolescence and resultant markdowns have been within expectations  there can be no guarantee that we will continue to experience the same level of markdowns we have in the past 
long lived assets 
management exercises judgment in evaluating our long lived assets for impairment 
we believe we will generate sufficient undiscounted cash flow to more than recover the investments made in property  plant and equipment 
our estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect our evaluations 
accruals 
management exercises judgment in estimating various period end liabilities such as costs related to vendor drop shipments  sales returns and allowances  cooperative advertising and customer rebate reserves  and other vendor and employee related costs 
while we believe that these estimates are reasonable  any significant deviation of actual costs as compared to these estimates could have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
income taxes 
we are subject to taxation from federal  state and foreign jurisdictions and the determination of our tax provision is complex and requires significant management judgment 
management judgment is also applied in the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowances that might be required in connection with our ability to realize deferred tax assets 
since we conduct operations in numerous us states and internationally  our effective tax rate has and will continue to depend upon the geographic distribution of our pre tax income or losses among locations with varying tax rates and rules 
as the geographic mix of our pre tax results among various tax jurisdictions changes  the effective tax rate may vary from period to period 
we are also subject to periodic examination from domestic and foreign tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
these examinations include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
we have established  and periodically reevaluate  an estimated income tax reserve on our consolidated balance sheet to provide for the possibility of adverse outcomes in income tax proceedings 
while management believes that we have identified all reasonably identifiable exposures and that the reserve we have established for identifiable exposures is appropriate under the circumstances  it is possible that additional exposures exist and that exposures may be settled at amounts different than the amounts reserved 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities and for tax loss carry forwards 
the realization of net deferred tax assets is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient future taxable income 
where it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  we have provided a valuation allowance 
if the realization of those deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  an adjustment to the valuation allowance may be required  which could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
restructuring charges 
we have taken restructuring actions  and may commence further restructuring activities which result in recognition of restructuring charges 
these actions require management to make judgments and utilize significant estimates regarding the nature  timing and amounts of costs associated with the activity 
when we incur a liability related to a restructuring action  we estimate and record all appropriate expenses  including expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  facility consolidation costs including estimates of sublease income  lease cancellations  asset impairments and any other exit costs 
should the actual amounts differ from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be impacted  which could materially affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
recently adopted and newly issued accounting pronouncements effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized for the year ended december  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for the vested portion of share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
the fair value of employee share options is recognized in expense over the vesting period of the options  using the graded attribution method 
the fair value of employee share options is determined on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the company has used historical volatility in its estimate of expected volatility 
the expected life represents the period of time in years for which the options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the company used the simplified method for determining expected life as permitted in sec staff accounting bulletin for options qualifying for such treatment plain vanilla options due to the limited history the company currently has with option exercise activity 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the consensus requires disclosure of either the gross or net presentation  and any such taxes reported on a gross basis should be disclosed in the interim and annual financial statements 
this issue is effective for financial reporting periods beginning after december  the company does not expect to change its presentation of such taxes  as its sales are currently recorded net of tax 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this interpretation was issued to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the company is currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of this pronouncement 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab provides interpretative guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
this pronouncement is effective for fiscal years ending after november  this pronouncement had no impact on the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december highlights from the discussion of our results of operations and financial condition that follows will provide information that will assist in understanding our financial statements and information about how certain accounting principles and estimates affect the consolidated financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements included herein

european sales  stated in us dollars  decreased to million for representing of worldwide sales compared to million representing of worldwide sales in movements in foreign exchange rates positively impacted european sales for by approximately million 
if currency exchange rates for had prevailed in  however  european sales would have decreased from the prior year 
continued weakness in demand for information technology products from business customers in europe and the effect of exchange rate movements on product pricing in certain european markets for products whose cost is us dollar based  resulted in decreased local currency denominated sales

gross profit was million  or of net sales  for the year ended december   compared to million or of net sales in our gross profit ratio declined in primarily as a result of approximately million of increased costs for warehouse staff and supplies related to increased activity levels from the prior year 
these increased costs were partially offset by favorable changes in product mix 
improvement in our gross profit ratio in north america was partially offset by a continued decline in our gross profit ratio in europe

these increases were partially offset by increased funding of advertising expenses from vendors 
restructuring and other charges during the year ended december   we incurred million of restructuring and other charges 
these costs were primarily related to further restructuring actions undertaken in europe during the year as a result of continuing decline in profitability 
the costs were comprised primarily of staff severance expense related to the elimination of approximately positions  which resulted in approximately million in annual savings 
we incurred million of restructuring and other charges in in the first quarter of we implemented a plan to streamline the activities of our united states computer businesses back office and warehouse operations  resulting in the elimination of approximately jobs 
we incurred million of restructuring costs associated with this plan  including million for staff severance and benefits for terminated employees and million of non cash costs for impairment of the carrying value of fixed assets 
we recorded million of additional costs in related to facility exit costs for our plan to consolidate united states warehouse locations 
we also implemented several cost reduction plans in europe during  including a consolidation of united kingdom sales offices which resulted in the elimination of jobs 
we incurred million of restructuring charges for facility exit costs and workforce reductions in connection with these actions and million of additional costs resulting from adjustments to our estimates of lease and contract termination costs for our plan to consolidate our united kingdom operations 
income from operations we had income from operations of million in  million in and million in income from operations for the year ended december  included restructuring and other charges of million 
for the year ended december   restructuring charges of million were included in income from operations 
income from operations in north america was million for the year ended december   million in and million in declining gross profit margin and increased selling  general and administrative expenses resulted in our implementation of the previously described restructuring activities in europe in and interest and other income and interest expense interest expense was million in  million in and million in interest expense decreased in as a result of decreased short term borrowings in the united kingdom as well as the extinguishment of mortgage debt related to our georgia warehouse sale in the first quarter of the increased expense in resulted from increased short term borrowings under our united kingdom facility 
interest and other income  net was million in  million in and million in the increase in other income in mainly resulted from the gain on sale of the georgia location 
income taxes our income tax provisions were million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the effective rates were in  in  and in the high effective tax rate in was a result of our establishing valuation allowances of approximately million for deferred tax assets in the united kingdom in the company s united kingdom subsidiary had recorded historical losses and had been affected by restructuring and other charges in recent years 
these losses represented evidence for management to estimate that a full valuation allowance for the net deferred tax asset was necessary in in the united kingdom subsidiary recorded a profit and the company s effective tax rate benefited by approximately or million 
the effective rate in also was unfavorably impacted by increased state and local taxes and losses in other foreign jurisdictions for which no tax benefit has been recognized 
these increases were partially offset by an income tax benefit of million we recorded in the fourth quarter of resulting from a favorable decision we received for a petition submitted in connection with audit assessments made in and in a foreign jurisdiction 
the tax rate in was higher than the united states statutory rate of primarily due to losses in foreign jurisdictions for which we recognized no tax benefit and losses in a foreign jurisdiction where the benefit rate is lower than the rate in the united states 
for the years ended december   and  we have not recognized certain foreign tax credits  certain state deferred tax assets in the united states and certain benefits on losses in foreign tax jurisdictions due to our inability to carry such credits and losses back to prior years and our determination that it was more likely than not that we would not generate sufficient future taxable income to realize these assets 
accordingly  valuation allowances were recorded against the deferred tax assets associated with those items 
if we are able to realize all or part of these deferred tax assets in future periods  it will reduce our provision for income taxes by a release of the corresponding valuation allowance 
net income net income was million  or per basic share and per diluted share  for the year ended december   million  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share  for the year ended december  and million  or 
per basic share and 
per diluted share  for the year ended december  seasonality net sales have historically been modestly weaker during the second and third quarters as a result of lower business activity during those months 
the following table sets forth the net sales  gross profit and income from operations for each of the quarters since january  amounts in millions 
march june september december net sales percentage of year s net sales gross profit income from operations net sales percentage of year s net sales gross profit income from operations net sales percentage of year s net sales gross profit income from operations financial condition  liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to support working capital requirements in our business  to fund capital expenditures and minimal acquisitions and fund the special dividend declared by our board in march we rely principally upon operating cash flow and borrowings under our credit facilities to meet these needs 
we believe that cash flow available from these sources will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements  projected capital expenditures and interest and debt repayments in the foreseeable future 
our working capital was million at december   an increase of million from million at the end of this was the result of a million increase in cash  a million increase in accounts receivable  a million increase in inventories  a million increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a decrease in short term borrowings of million offset by a million increase in accounts payable  and a million increase in accrued expense and other current liabilities  and a million decrease in deferred tax assets 
the million increase in our inventories was principally in our domestic us locations 
inventory turnover increased slightly from to times in the increase in accounts receivable occurred in europe  resulting from our increased sales 
this also increased our days of sales outstanding from in to in we expect that future accounts receivable and inventory balances will fluctuate with the mix of our net sales between consumer and business customers  as well as geographic regions 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents primarily in money market funds or their equivalent 
as of december   all of our investments mature in less than three months 
accordingly  we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in of million as compared to resulted from a million increase in net income adjusted by other non cash items  such as depreciation expense  and a decrease of million in cash used for changes in our working capital accounts 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in as compared to resulted from an increase in cash provided by net income adjusted by other non cash items  such as depreciation expense  and a decrease in cash used for changes in our working capital accounts 
cash provided by net income and other non cash items was million in  an increase of million  compared to million in  and was primarily attributable to the million increase in the provision for deferred income taxes 
the cash used for changes in our working capital accounts was million in compared to million in net cash of million was provided by investing activities for the year ended december  proceeds from disposals of property and equipment was million primarily the result of the sale of our distribution facility in suwanee  georgia 
we used cash of million during  million during and million during in investing activities  principally for the purchase of property  plant and equipment 
capital expenditures in both  and included upgrades and enhancements to our information and communications systems hardware and facilities costs for the opening of additional retail outlet stores in north america 
net cash of million was used in financing activities for the year ended december  repayment of short and long term borrowings used approximately million of cash and proceeds from stock option exercises and excess tax benefits from stock option exercises provided approximately million of cash 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities in  primarily as a result of an increase in our short term borrowings in europe 
net cash of million was used in financing activities in  primarily for the repayment of short and long term borrowings 
we amended our million secured united states revolving credit agreement in october to increase the amount available to million which may be increased by up to an additional million  subject to certain conditions  increase the number of lenders participating and to provide for borrowings by both our united states and united kingdom businesses 
the upgraded facility expires in october borrowings under the agreement are subject to borrowing base limitations of up to of eligible accounts receivable and of qualified inventories and are secured by accounts receivable  inventories and certain other assets 
the undrawn availability under the facility may not be less than million until the last day of any month in which the availability net of outstanding borrowings is at least million 
the revolving credit agreement requires that we maintain a minimum level of availability 
if such availability is not maintained  we will then be required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined 
the agreement contains certain other covenants  including restrictions on capital expenditures and payments of dividends 
we were in compliance with all of the covenants as of december   except for the required timely submission of certain financial statements  for which we have obtained a waiver 
as of december   eligible collateral under the facility was million  there were outstanding advances of million all in the united kingdom  outstanding letters of credit of million and total availability of million 
in connection with the amendment to our revolving credit agreement in october  we terminated our million multi currency credit facility with a financial institution in the united kingdom  which was available to our united kingdom subsidiaries 
we also paid off the remaining million balance on our united kingdom term loan  which we had entered into in to finance the construction of our united kingdom headquarters 
our netherlands subsidiary has a million million at the december  exchange rate  which exchange rate applies to all other euro denominated amounts below credit facility 
borrowings under the facility are secured by the subsidiary s accounts receivable and are subject to a borrowing base limitation of of the eligible accounts 
at december  there were million million of borrowings outstanding under this line with interest payable at a rate of 
the facility expires in august in april  we entered into a ten year  million mortgage loan on our suwanee  georgia distribution facility 
the mortgage had monthly principal and interest payments of  payable through may  with a final additional principal payment of million at maturity in may the mortgage loan bore interest at and was collateralized by the underlying land and building 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we sold this facility and repaid the remaining balance on the loan 
the facility was replaced by a larger  leased distribution center in a nearby area 
we are obligated under non cancelable operating leases for the rental of most of our facilities and certain of our equipment which expire at various dates through we currently lease our new york facility from an entity owned by richard leeds  robert leeds and bruce leeds  the company s three principal shareholders and senior executive officers 
the annual rental totals  and the lease expires in we have sublease agreements for unused space we lease in compton  california and wellingborough  england 
in the event a sublessee is unable to fulfill its obligations  we would be responsible for rent due under the lease 
however  we expect the sublessees will fulfill their obligations under the leases 
following is a summary of our contractual obligations for future principal payments on our debt  minimum rental payments on our non cancelable operating leases and minimum payments on our other purchase obligations at december  in thousands after contractual obligations payments on capital lease obligations payments on non cancelable operating leases  net of subleases     dividends payable  purchase and other obligations     total contractual obligations     our purchase and other obligations consist primarily of certain employment agreements and service agreements 
in addition to the contractual obligations noted above  we had million of standby letters of credit outstanding as of december  our operating results have generated cash flow which  together with borrowings under our debt agreements  has provided sufficient capital resources to finance working capital and cash operating requirements  fund capital expenditures  and fund the payment of interest on outstanding debt 
our primary ongoing cash requirements will be to finance working capital  provide payment of the special shareholder dividend of approximately million declared in the first quarter of  fund the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness  fund capital expenditures  fund minimal acquisitions and fund any future special shareholder dividends that may be declared 
we believe future cash flows from operations and availability of borrowings under our lines of credit will be sufficient to fund ongoing cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we are party to certain litigation  the outcome of which we believe  based on discussions with legal counsel  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us and international interest rates as well as changes in currency exchange rates principally pounds sterling  euros and canadian dollars as measured against the us dollar and each other 
the translation of the financial statements of our operations located outside of the united states is impacted by movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
changes in currency exchange rates as measured against the us dollar may positively or negatively affect sales  gross margins  operating expenses and retained earnings as expressed in us dollars 
sales would have fluctuated by approximately million and income from operations would have fluctuated by approximately million if average foreign exchange rates changed by in we have limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes 
we may enter into foreign currency options or forward exchange contracts aimed at limiting in part the impact of certain currency fluctuations  but as of december  we had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our variable rate debt 
our variable rate debt consists of short term borrowings under our credit facilities 
as of december   the balance outstanding on our variable rate debt was approximately million 
a hypothetical change in average interest rates of one percentage point is not expected to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows over the next fiscal year
