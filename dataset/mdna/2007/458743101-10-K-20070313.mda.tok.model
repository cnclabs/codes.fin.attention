amsan s primary end markets are institutional facilities  such as schools and universities  health care sites  lodging and government properties and building service contractors

as a result of this acquisition  we analyzed our reportable segments 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information fas  we have two operating segments interline brands and amsan 
we aggregated these segments into one reportable segment  the distribution of mro products  because they posses similar economic characteristics and have common products  customers and methods of distribution

accounting and disclosure changes effective december   we adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment  fas r using the modified prospective application transition method 
under this method  the share based compensation cost recognized beginning december  includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value originally estimated in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  fas and all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of fas r 
compensation cost under fas r is recognized ratably using the straight line attribution method over the expected vesting period or to the retirement eligibility date  if less than the vesting period when vesting is not contingent upon any future performance 
in addition  pursuant to fas r  we are required to estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating the compensation costs  instead of accounting for forfeitures as incurred  which was the method previously used by us 
as of december   the cumulative effect of adopting the estimated forfeiture method was not significant 
prior periods are not restated under this transition method 
fas r also requires us to reflect the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options in the statement of cash flows as a cash inflow from financing activities and as a cash outflow from operating activities 
prior to the adoption of fas r  these tax benefits have been reflected as a cash inflow from operating activities 
the prior year statement of cash flows has not been restated 
the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options was million and million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
there were no stock options exercised during the year ended december  as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock awards 
the cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
prior to december   we accounted for share based compensation plans in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb as permitted by fas we elected to use the intrinsic value method of accounting for employee and director share based compensation expense for our nonqualified employee and director stock option awards and did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price of the underlying common stock at the date of grant 
had we elected to adopt the fair value approach as prescribed by fas  which charges earnings for the estimated fair value of stock options  our net income for the years ended december  and december  would have been million and million lower  respectively 
had we elected to adopt the fair value approach as prescribed by fas  our basic and diluted earnings per share would have been and lower for the year ended december   respectively  and our basic and diluted loss per share would have been and higher for the year ended december   respectively 
as a result of adopting fas r on december   our income before income taxes and net income for the year ended december   are million and million lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb basic and diluted earnings per share are lower for the year ended december  than if we had continued to account for share based compensation under apb results of operations the following table presents information derived from the consolidated statements of earnings expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods indicated of net sales of net sales increase increase fiscal year ended decrease fiscal year ended decrease december  december  december  december  vs
