item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regarding the company s capital expenditures 
competition the supermarket industry is highly competitive and characterized by narrow profit margins 
the degree of competition the company s stores encounter varies by location  primarily based on the size of the community the store is located in and its proximity to other communities 
the company s principal competitors are  in alphabetical order  bi lo  llc  food city k va t food stores  inc  food lion delhaize america  inc  the kroger co  publix super markets  inc  target corporation  and wal mart stores  inc increasingly over the last few years  competition for consumers food dollars has intensified due to the addition of  or increase in  food sections by many types of retailers such as specialty grocers  drug and convenience stores  national general merchandisers and discount retailers  membership clubs  warehouse stores and super centers 
also  the consumer trend of eating out has made restaurants another significant competitor for food dollars 
supermarket chains generally compete on the basis of location  quality of products  service  price  convenience  product variety and store condition 
the company believes its competitive advantages include convenient locations  the quality of service it provides its customers  competitive pricing  product variety and quality and a pleasant shopping environment  which is enhanced by its ongoing modernization program 
the company s strategy is to place its supermarkets in suburban areas  small towns and rural communities 
because the company has operated in many of its markets longer than many of its competitors  it has been able to place its stores in prime locations 
furthermore  unlike many of its competitors  the company owns property on which a majority of its stores are located  allowing it the flexibility to expand the store when needed 
by concentrating its operations within a relatively small geographic region  the company is also positioned to more carefully monitor its markets  and the needs of its customers within those markets 
the company s senior executives live and work in the company s operating region  thereby allowing management to quickly identify changes in needs and customer preference 
because of the company s size  store managers have direct access to corporate management and are able to receive quick decisions regarding requested changes in operations 
the company can then move quickly to make adjustments in its business in response to changes in the market and customer needs 
the ingles advantage card provides information to better understand the company s customers shopping patterns in various demographic categories and to develop targeted marketing programs based on this information 
the company supports its quality image by carrying high quality perishable items 
one major quality advantage of the company is that it offers its customers only usda choice beef cut by butchers located in the stores 
many of ingles competitors feature lower grade usda select beef and do not have butchers located in their stores 
the company has expanded its offering of certified organic products to include organic dairy  perishable and frozen items 
the company also carries a wide variety of produce  quality private label brands plus a variety of popular national and regional brands 
the company s large national and international competitors primary advantages are related to their size 
these larger organizations may have an advantage through stronger buying power and more significant capital resources 
certain competitors  such as super centers  may be able to operate with smaller margins in the food sections of their stores by relying on their higher margins on the general merchandise sections of their stores to compensate 
the company s management monitors competitive activity and regularly reviews and periodically adjusts the company s marketing and business strategies as management deems appropriate in light of existing conditions in the company s region 
the company s ability to remain competitive in its changing markets will depend in part on its ability to pursue its expansion and renovation programs and its response to remodeling and new store openings by its competitors 
seasonality sales in the grocery segment of the company s business are subject to a slight seasonal variance due to holiday related sales and due to sales in areas where seasonal homes are located 
sales are traditionally higher in the company s first fiscal quarter due to the inclusion of sales related to thanksgiving and christmas 
the company s second fiscal quarter traditionally has the lowest sales of the year  unless easter falls in that quarter 
in the third and fourth quarters  sales are affected by the return of customers to seasonal homes in the company s market area 
the fluid dairy segment of the company s business has slight seasonal variation to the extent of its sales into the grocery industry 
the company s real estate segment is not subject to seasonal variations 
employees and labor relations at september   the company had approximately  employees  of which were supermarket personnel 
approximately of these employees work on a part time basis 
none of the employees are represented by a labor union 
management considers employee relations to be good 
the company values its employees and believes that employee loyalty and enthusiasm are key elements of its operating performance 
trademarks and licenses the company employs various trademarks and service marks in its business  the most important of which are its own laura lynn private label trademark  the ingles advantage service mark  and the ingles service mark 
these service marks and the trademark are federally registered in the united states pursuant to applicable intellectual property laws and are the property of ingles 
in addition  the company uses the sealtest  pet  biltmore and light n lively trademarks pursuant to agreements entered into in connection with its milk  fruit juice and spring water processing and packaging operations 
the company believes it has all material licenses and permits necessary to conduct its business 
the current expiration dates for significant trade and service marks are as follows ingles december   laura lynn march   and the ingles advantage august  each registration may be renewed for an additional ten year term prior to its expiration 
the company intends to file all renewals timely 
each of the company s trademark license agreements has a one year term which  with respect to one license  is automatically renewed annually  unless the owner of the trademark provides notice of termination prior to the then expiration date and  with respect to the other licenses  are renewed periodically by letter from the licensor 
the company currently has eight pending applications for additional trademarks or service marks 
environmental matters under applicable environmental laws  the company may be responsible for remediation of environmental conditions and may be subject to associated liabilities relating to its stores and other buildings and the land on which such stores and other buildings are situated including responsibility and liability related to its operation of its gas stations and the storage of gasoline in underground storage tanks  regardless of whether the company leases or owns the stores  other buildings or land in question and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by the company or by a prior owner or tenant 
the company s liabilities may also include costs and judgments resulting from lawsuits brought by private litigants 
the presence of contamination from hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to properly remediate such contaminated property  may adversely affect the company s ability to sell or rent such real property or to borrow using such real property as collateral 
although the company typically conducts a limited environmental review prior to acquiring or leasing new stores  other buildings or raw land  there can be no assurance that environmental conditions relating to prior  existing or future stores  other buildings or the real properties on which such stores or other buildings are situated will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
federal  state and local governments could enact laws or regulations concerning environmental matters that affect the company s operations or facilities or increase the cost of producing or distributing the company s products 
the company believes that it currently conducts its operations  and in the past has conducted its operations  in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws 
the company  however  cannot predict the environmental liabilities that may result from legislation or regulations adopted in the future  the effect of which could be retroactive 
nor can the company predict how existing or future laws and regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist at its facilities or at other properties where the company or its predecessors have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances 
the enactment of more stringent laws or regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws and regulations could require expenditures by the company  some of which could have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation the company is subject to regulation by a variety of governmental agencies  including  but not limited to  the us food and drug administration  the us department of agriculture  the occupational health and safety administration and other federal  state and local agencies 
the company s stores are also subject to local laws regarding zoning  land use and the sale of alcoholic beverages 
the company believes that its locations are in material compliance with such laws and regulations 
item a 
risk factors the company s expansion and renovation plans may not be successful which may adversely affect its business and financial condition due to the capital expenditures and management resources required to carry out its plans 
the company has spent  and intends to continue to spend  significant capital and management resources on the development and implementation of its expansion and renovation plans 
these plans  if implemented  may not be successful and may not improve operating results and may have an adverse effect on cash flow due to the significant amount of capital invested 
the company s new  relocated and remodeled stores may initially operate at a loss  depending on factors such as prevailing competition  development cost  and its market position in the surrounding community 
the level of sales and profit margins in the company s existing stores may not be duplicated in its new stores which could have an adverse affect on the company s business and financial condition 
the company s warehouse and distribution center  as well as all of its stores  are concentrated in the southeastern united states  which makes the company vulnerable to economic downturns  natural disasters and other adverse conditions or other catastrophic events in this region 
the company operates in the southeastern united states  with a strong concentration in georgia  north carolina  south carolina and tennessee 
the company s headquarters  warehouse and distribution center are located in north carolina and all of its stores are located in the southeast region 
as a result  the company s business is more susceptible to regional factors than the operations of more geographically diversified competitors 
these factors include  among others  changes in the economy  weather conditions  demographics and population 
the company s principal stockholder  robert p 
ingle  has the ability to elect a majority of the company s directors  appoint new members of management and approve many actions requiring shareholder approval 
mr 
ingle s share ownership represents approximately of the combined voting power of all classes of the company s capital stock 
as a result  mr 
ingle has the power to elect a majority of the company s directors and approve any action requiring the approval of the holders of the company s class a common stock and class b common stock  including adopting certain amendments to the company s charter and approving mergers or sales of substantially all of the company s assets 
currently  three of the company s nine directors are members of the ingle family 
circumstances may occur in which the interests of mr 
ingle could be in conflict with the interests of other holders of the company s class a common stock and class b common stock 
various aspects of the company s business are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations 
the company s compliance with these regulations may require additional capital expenditures and could adversely affect the company s ability to conduct its business as planned 
the company is subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to zoning  land use  work place safety  public health  community right to know  beer and wine sales  pharmaceutical sales and gasoline station operations 
a number of states and local jurisdictions regulate the licensing of supermarkets  including beer and wine license grants 
in addition  under certain local regulations  the company is prohibited from selling beer and wine in certain stores 
the company s ownership and development of real estate and operation of gas stations may subject it to liability under state and federal environmental laws 
employers are also subject to law governing their relationship with employees  including minimum wage requirements  overtime  working conditions  disabled access and work permit requirements 
compliance with  or changes in  these laws could reduce the revenue and profitability of the company s supermarkets and could otherwise adversely affect its business  financial condition or results of operations 
a number of federal  state and local laws exist which impose burdens or restrictions on owners with respect to access by disabled persons 
compliance with these laws may result in modifications to company properties  or prevent certain further renovations  with respect to access by disabled persons 
the company is affected by certain operating costs which could increase or fluctuate considerably 
the company depends on qualified employees to operate its stores and may be affected by future tight labor markets 
moreover  all of the company s stores are located in the southeastern united states which has recently experienced lower average unemployment rates than other parts of the country making it more difficult for the company to attract and retain qualified employees 
a shortage of qualified employees could require the company to enhance its wage and benefit package in order to better compete for and retain qualified employees  and the company may not be able to recover these increased labor costs through price increases charged to customers  which could significantly increase its operating costs 
fluctuating fuel costs adversely affect the company s operating costs in that the company requires fuel for its fleet of tractors and trailers which distribute goods from the company s distribution facility and for its fluid dairy operations 
in addition  operations at the company s stores are sensitive to rising utility fuel costs due to the amount of electricity and gas required to operate the stores and the influence of petroleum costs on plastic bags and wraps 
finally  interchange fees charged to the company for accepting debit and credit cards have increased substantially and may continue to increase as more customer transactions are settled with debit and credit cards 
the company s industry is highly competitive 
if the company is unable to compete effectively  its financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
the supermarket industry is and will remain highly competitive and is expected to be characterized by industry consolidation  continued competition from supercenters  and the development of smaller  more specialized stores 
furthermore  some of the company s competitors have greater financial resources and could use these financial resources to take measures  such as altering product mix or reducing prices  which could adversely affect the company s competitive position 
the company also faces increasing competition from restaurants and fast food chains due to the increasing proportion of household food expenditures for food prepared outside the home 
in addition  certain of the company s stores also compete with local video stores  florists  book stores  pharmacies and gas stations 
the company has  and expects to continue to have  a significant amount of debt 
at september  the company had total debt of million 
a significant potion of the company s cash flow is used to service indebtedness 
at september  debt totaling million was secured by real estate and equipment owned by the company 
this could limit the company s ability to dispose of mortgaged property without payment of the associated debt 
the company expects to incur additional debt to support its growth and expansion plans 
there can be no assurances that sources of financing will be available to the company on acceptable terms or that new and expanded stores will generate sufficient cash flow to service any additional debt 
disruptions in the efficient distribution of food products to the company s warehouse and stores may adversely affect the company s business 
the company s business could be adversely affected by disruptions in the efficient distribution of food products to the company s warehouse and to our stores 
such disruptions could be caused by  among other things  adverse weather conditions  food contamination recalls and civil unrest in foreign countries in which our suppliers do business

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview ingles  a leading supermarket chain in the southeast united states  operates supermarkets in georgia  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  virginia and alabama 
the company locates its supermarkets primarily in suburban areas  small towns and rural communities 
ingles supermarkets offer customers a wide variety of nationally advertised food products  including grocery  meat and dairy products  produce  frozen foods and other perishables and non food products  including health and beauty care products and general merchandise  as well as quality private label items

during fiscal  the company began adding fuel centers and pharmacies at select store locations 
as of september   the company operates in store pharmacies and fuel centers 
ingles also operates two other lines of business  fluid dairy processing and shopping center rentals 
the fluid dairy processing segment sells approximately of its products to the retail grocery segment and approximately of its products to third parties 
real estate ownership including the shopping center rental segment is an important component of the company s operations  providing both operational and economic benefit 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that management believes are important to the portrayal of ingles financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
self insurance the company is self insured for workers compensation and group medical and dental benefits 
risks and uncertainties are associated with self insurance  however  the company has limited its exposure by maintaining excess liability coverages 
self insurance liabilities are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported 
the estimates are based on data provided by the respective claims administrators 
these estimates can fluctuate if historical trends are not predictive of the future 
the majority of the company s properties are self insured for casualty losses and business interruption  however  liability coverage is maintained 
asset impairments the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for assets to be held and used  the company tests for impairment using undiscounted cash flows and calculates the amount of impairment using discounted cash flows 
for assets held for sale  impairment is recognized based on the excess of remaining book value over expected recovery value 
the recovery value is the fair value as determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal associates 
estimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgments based upon the company s experience and knowledge of local operations and cash flows that are projected for several years into the future 
these estimates can fluctuate significantly due to changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment  capital spending decisions and inflation 
the company monitors the carrying value of long lived assets for potential impairment each quarter based on whether any indicators of impairment have occurred 
closed store accrual for properties closed prior to december  that were under long term lease agreements  the present value of any remaining liability under the lease  discounted using risk free rates and net of expected sublease recovery  is recognized as a liability and expensed 
for all store closures subsequent to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective december   the liability is recognized and expensed based on the difference between the present value of any remaining liability under the lease and the present value of the estimated market rate at which the company expects to be able to sublease the properties 
the company s estimates of market rates are based on its experience  knowledge and typical third party advice or market data 
if the real estate and leasing markets change  sublease recovery could vary significantly from the recoveries originally assumed  resulting in a material change in the company s recorded liability 
the closed store accrual is included in the line item accrued expenses and current portion of other long term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
vendor allowances the company receives funds for a variety of merchandising activities from the many vendors whose products the company buys for resale in its stores 
these incentives and allowances are primarily comprised of volume or purchase based incentives  advertising allowances  slotting fees  and promotional discounts 
the purpose of these incentives and allowances is generally to help defray the costs incurred by the company for stocking  advertising  promoting and selling the vendor s products 
these allowances generally relate to short term arrangements with vendors  often relating to a period of a month or less  and are negotiated on a purchase by purchase or transaction by transaction basis 
whenever possible  vendor discounts and allowances that relate to buying and merchandising activities are recorded as a component of item cost in inventory and recognized in merchandise costs when the item is sold 
due to system constraints and the nature of certain allowances  it is sometimes not practicable to apply allowances to the item cost of inventory 
in those instances  the allowances are applied as a reduction of merchandise costs using a rational and systematic methodology  which results in the recognition of these incentives when the inventory related to the vendor consideration received is sold 
vendor allowances applied as a reduction of merchandise costs totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   respectively 
vendor advertising allowances that represent a reimbursement of specific identifiable incremental costs of advertising the vendor s specific products are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred 
vendor advertising allowances recorded as a reduction of advertising expense totaled million  million  and million for the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   respectively 
if vendor advertising allowances were substantially reduced or eliminated  the company would likely consider other methods of advertising as well as the volume and frequency of the company s product advertising  which could increase or decrease the company s expenditures 
similarly  the company is not able to assess the impact of vendor advertising allowances on creating additional revenues  as such allowances do not directly generate revenue for the company s stores 
tax contingencies despite the company s belief that its tax positions are consistent with applicable tax laws  the company believes that certain positions are likely to be challenged by taxing authorities 
settlement of any challenge can result in no change  a complete disallowance  or some partial adjustment reached through negotiations or litigation 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s tax contingencies 
the company s contingencies are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of its tax audits as well as evolving case law 
income tax expense includes the impact of contingency provisions and changes to contingencies that the company considers appropriate 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require use of cash 
favorable resolution would be recognized as a reduction to income tax expense at the time of resolution 
during the fiscal year  the company settled a tax position under an initiative offered by one of the states in which the company conducts its operations 
as a result of this settlement  the company reduced its reserve for contingent income tax liabilities by million 
this reduction is reflected as a reduction of income tax expense for the year ended september  results of operations ingles operates on a or week fiscal year ending on the last saturday in september 
the consolidated statements of income for the fiscal years ended september   september  and september   included  and weeks of operations  respectively

information obtained from holders of the ingles advantage card assists the company in optimizing product offerings and promotions specific to customer shopping patterns 
net sales to outside parties for the company s milk processing subsidiary increased to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year much of the sales increase was attributable to a increase in the average cost of raw milk  representing approximately cents per gallon 
raw milk cost increases are generally passed through to higher sales prices 
case volume sales increased by approximately during fiscal compared to fiscal the company expects continued sales growth in the upcoming fiscal year 
the magnitude of expected growth could vary significantly due to volatility in the retail price of gasoline  overall food price inflation and changes in the mix of products sold by the company
