item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion is intended to analyze major elements of the company s consolidated financial statements and provide insight into important areas of management s focus 
this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the company has accounted for the discontinuance or disposal of certain businesses as discontinued operations  and has adjusted prior period financial information to exclude these businesses from continuing operations 
statements in the following discussion may include forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
see item a 
risk factors  for additional discussion of these factors and risks 
business overview during  the company continued to execute its long term growth strategy  resulting in unprecedented levels of consolidated assets  long term debt  revenues and profitability 
funded by its operating cash flow and its increased borrowing capabilities  the company expended significant capital to enhance and expand each of its operating segments  both through acquisitions and internal capital projects 
the acquisition of the assets and operations of epic divers  inc and associated affiliate companies epic  a full service diving operation  allows the wa d division to diversify its service offerings and enhance its efficiency in performing its operations for customers 
the wa d division also expanded its vessel fleet by purchasing  refurbishing  and leasing service vessels in order to meet the current high demand for its services in the gulf of mexico following the hurricane season 
the wa d division s maritech resources  inc subsidiary maritech continued to invest in exploitation and development projects during  designed to increase its operating cash flows 
the company consummated the acquisition of beacon resources  llc beacon  a domestic production testing operation  to diversify its growing production testing operations 
the company intends to continue this growth strategy in  with an expected capital expenditure program of approximately million 
specific areas of planned investment include the continued growth of compressco s fleet of compressor equipment  the beginning of a multiyear fluids division development project to construct a new calcium chloride plant and expand its existing brominated fluids production facility  and the exploitation and development of additional maritech properties 
these capital expenditure plans are expected to be funded with operating cash flow and from additional borrowings under the company s expanded bank revolving credit facility 
each of the acquisitions and capital projects contributed to the significant increase in the company s consolidated revenues which increased to million and gross profit which increased to million and positions the company to further capitalize on future growth opportunities in the current market 
the wa d services segment s acquisition of epic and the expansion of its vessel fleet contributed to a significant increase in its revenues  although profitability was impacted by weather related inefficiencies 
the company s production enhancement division reflected the growing demand for its products and services  particularly for its production testing operations 
maritech s revenues increased dramatically as a result of increased production volumes from the significant producing property acquisitions during the prior year  as well as from strong commodity prices during consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenues increased to during  compared to in the prior year  mainly due to the increased profitability of maritech  which experienced significant storm repair downtime during the prior year immediately following its property acquisitions  and the fluids division  primarily due to increased product prices  a more favorable mix of higher margin products and services  and the sale of lower cost inventory during the period 
demand for the company s products and services depends primarily on activity in the oil and gas exploration and production industry  which is significantly affected by the level of capital expenditures for the exploration and production of oil and gas reserves and for the plugging and decommissioning of abandoned oil and gas properties 
industry expenditures for drilling  as indicated by onshore rig count statistics  have risen during the past five years and reflect the industry s response to higher crude oil and natural gas pricing during this period 
continued strong demand is largely dependent on continued high commodity pricing  although the company believes that there will also continue to be growth opportunities for the company s products and services in both the us and international markets  supported primarily by increases in technologically driven deepwater gas well completions in the gulf of mexico  continued reservoir depletion in the us  advancing age of offshore platforms in the gulf of mexico  increasing development of oil and gas reserves abroad  and storm damage to offshore production facilities in the gulf of mexico 
the company s fluids division generates revenues and cash flows by manufacturing and selling completion fluids and providing filtration and associated products and engineering services to domestic and international exploration and production companies worldwide 
the demand for the company s products and services is particularly affected by drilling activity in the gulf of mexico  which has remained flat or decreased during the past several years due to the maturity of a majority of gulf of mexico producing fields 
somewhat offsetting this impact is the current industry trend for drilling deeper offshore gas prospects that generally require higher volumes and precisely engineered brine solutions 
the fluids division also provides certain liquid and dry calcium chloride products manufactured at its production facilities to a variety of markets outside the energy industry 
fluids division revenues increased during compared to the prior year  due to increased prices and service activity 
further growth by the fluids division is predicated on the availability of selected raw materials at acceptable cost levels and the ability of the company to maintain acceptable sales margins 
in late  the division executed an agreement for the favorable long term supply for a key raw material  although the division s near term margins will be reduced due to higher inventory costs during the transition to this new favorable supply 
the wa d division consists of two operating segments the wa d services and maritech segments 
wa d services generates revenues and cash flows by performing well plug and abandonment  pipeline and platform decommissioning  and removal and site clearance services for oil and gas companies 
in addition  the segment provides diving  marine  engineering  electric wireline  workover  and drilling services 
the segment s services are marketed primarily in the gulf coast region of the us including onshore  offshore and in inland waters 
long term gulf of mexico platform decommissioning and well abandonment activity levels are driven primarily by mms regulations and the age of producing fields and production platforms and structures 
in the shorter term  activity levels are driven by the repair work required by the offshore industry following hurricanes katrina and rita during  oil and gas commodity prices  sales activity of mature oil and gas producing properties  and overall oil and gas company activity levels 
given the significant damage incurred by many offshore operators as a result of the hurricanes  many of the division s customers are escalating their well abandonment and decommissioning efforts due to the risks posed by future storms and the increased insurance costs associated with their offshore platforms and properties 
wa d services revenues increased by during  primarily due to increased post hurricane demand for well abandonment and decommissioning services  the division s increased capacity to perform those services  and from the march acquisition of epic 
approximately of the revenues generated by the wa d services segment were from work performed for maritech  and were eliminated in consolidation 
the maritech segment acquires  manages  develops  and exploits producing oil and gas properties and generates revenues and cash flows from the sale of the associated oil and natural gas production volumes 
through maritech  the wa d division provides oil and gas companies with alternative ways of managing their well abandonment obligations  while effectively baseloading well abandonment and decommissioning work for the wa d services segment of the division 
during  maritech s operations reflected significant production volumes and revenues from the oil and gas properties which it acquired in the third quarter of  as well as the strong commodity price environment which prevailed for most of the year  as maritech s revenues increased by compared to in addition  maritech expended approximately million on development and exploitation projects during  mostly on properties acquired in a portion of maritech s increased production volumes during are attributed to the success of these efforts 
maritech expects that the new production volumes resulting from these successful development activities will also generate increased revenues and cash flows during compared to  despite expected lower realized gas commodity prices 
most of the maritech properties which were shut in following the hurricanes have resumed production  although maritech continues to perform and assess the well intervention and debris removal efforts associated with three offshore platforms that were destroyed in the storms 
maritech expects that substantially all of the approximately million of platform repair and well intervention costs expended through december  will be reimbursed pursuant to the company s various insurance policies 
the production enhancement division generates revenues and cash flows by performing flowback pressure and volume testing and providing low pressure wellhead compression equipment and other services for oil and gas producers 
the primary testing markets served are in texas  louisiana  new mexico  the us gulf of mexico  mexico  and brazil 
compressco  the division s wellhead compression operation  markets its equipment and services principally in the mid continent  mid western  western  rocky mountain  and gulf coast regions of the united states as well as in western canada and mexico 
the production enhancement division also provides the technology and services required for separation and recycling of oily residuals generated from petroleum refining to oil refineries in the united states 
the division s operations are generally driven by the demand for natural gas and oil and the resulting industry drilling and completion activities in the domestic and international markets which the division serves 
production enhancement division revenues increased in as compared to  primarily due to the growth of the division s existing domestic production testing and compressco operations  as well as from the march acquisition of beacon  which expanded the division s production testing market territory into western texas and eastern new mexico 
the company anticipates continued growth in revenues and cash flows from the division during  as its domestic operations continue to grow as a result of increased industry activity  and as the division continues to seek new domestic and international markets for its testing and compressco operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments  including those related to potential impairments of long lived assets including goodwill  the collectibility of accounts receivable  and the current cost of future abandonment and decommissioning obligations 
note b summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements contains the accounting policies governing each of these matters 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on future expectations  which we believe are reasonable 
the combination of these factors forms the basis for judgments made about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these judgments and estimates may change as new events occur  as new information is acquired  and with changes in our operating environment 
actual results are likely to differ from our current estimates  and those differences may be material 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the determination of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill  is conducted periodically whenever indicators of impairment are present 
goodwill is assessed for potential impairment at least annually 
if such indicators are present  the determination of the amount of impairment is based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
the oil and gas industry is cyclical  and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
oil and gas properties maritech accounts for its interests in oil and gas properties using the successful efforts method  whereby costs incurred to drill and equip development wells  including unsuccessful development wells  are capitalized  and costs related to unsuccessful exploratory wells are expensed as incurred 
all capitalized costs are accumulated and recorded separately for each field  and are depleted on a unit of production basis  based on the estimated remaining proved oil and gas reserves of each field 
the process of estimating oil and gas reserves is complex  requiring significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
as a result  these estimates are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  cash flows  development expenditures  operating and abandonment expenses  and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those initially estimated by maritech 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of proved reserves 
maritech s oil and gas properties are assessed for impairment in value whenever indicators become evident  with any impairment charged to expense 
maritech purchases oil and gas properties and assumes the associated well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities 
the acquired oil and gas producing properties are recorded at a cost equal to the estimated fair value of the decommissioning liabilities assumed  adjusted by the amount of any cash or other consideration received or paid 
any significant differences in the actual amounts of oil and gas production cash flows produced or decommissioning costs incurred  compared to the estimated amounts recorded  will affect our anticipated profitability 
decommissioning liabilities we estimate the third party market values including an estimated profit to plug and abandon the wells  decommission the pipelines and platforms and clear the sites  and use these estimates to record maritech s well abandonment and decommissioning liabilities  net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amount to be paid by the previous owners of the property referred to as decommissioning liabilities 
in estimating the decommissioning liabilities  we perform detailed estimating procedures  analysis  and engineering studies 
whenever practical  maritech utilizes the services of its affiliated companies to perform well abandonment and decommissioning work 
when these services are performed by an affiliated company  all recorded intercompany revenues are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
any profit earned by us in performing such abandonment and decommissioning operations on maritech s properties is recorded as the work is performed 
the recorded decommissioning liability associated with a specific property is fully extinguished when the property is completely abandoned 
once a maritech well abandonment and decommissioning project is performed  any remaining decommissioning liability in excess of the actual costs of the work performed is recorded as additional profit on the project and included in earnings in the period in which the project is completed 
conversely  actual costs in excess of the decommissioning liability are charged against earnings in the period in which the work is performed 
we review the adequacy of our decommissioning liability whenever indicators suggest that either the amount or timing of the estimated cash flows underlying the liability have changed materially 
the timing and amounts of these cash flows are subject to changes in the energy industry environment and may result in additional liabilities recorded  which  in turn  would increase the carrying values of the related properties 
revenue recognition we generate revenue on certain well abandonment and decommissioning projects from billings under contracts  which are typically of short duration  that provide for either lump sum turnkey charges or specific time  material  and equipment charges which are billed in accordance with the terms of such contracts 
with regard to turnkey contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs at completion 
total project revenue and cost estimates for turnkey contracts are reviewed periodically as work progresses  and adjustments are reflected in the period in which such estimates are revised 
provisions for estimated losses on such contracts are made in the period such losses are determined 
bad debt reserves reserves for bad debts are calculated on a specific identification basis  whereby we estimate whether or not specific accounts receivable will be collected 
a significant portion of our revenues come from oil and gas exploration and production companies 
if  due to adverse circumstances  certain customers are unable to repay some or all of the amounts owed us  an additional bad debt allowance may be required 
income taxes we provide for income taxes by taking into account the differences between the financial statement treatment and tax treatment of certain transactions 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis amounts 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date 
this calculation requires us to make certain estimates about our future operations 
changes in state  federal  and foreign tax laws  as well as changes in our financial condition  could affect these estimates 
acquisition purchase price allocations the accounting for acquisitions of businesses using the purchase method requires the allocation of the purchase price based on the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
we estimate the fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired using accepted valuation methods  and in many cases  such estimates are based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows expected to be generated from the acquired assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
we have completed several acquisitions during the past several years and have accounted for the various assets including intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on our estimate of fair values 
goodwill represents the excess of acquisition purchase price over the estimated fair values of the assets and liabilities acquired 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standard r  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  compensation cost recognized during includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
as amended  accounting for share based compensation sfas no 
 and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted beginning january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method  whereby compensation cost for stock options was measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the company s stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  results for prior periods have not been restated 
the company estimates the fair value of share based payments of stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires a number of assumptions  of which the most significant are expected stock price volatility  the expected pre vesting forfeiture rate  and the expected option term the amount of time from the grant date until the options are exercised or expire 
expected volatility is calculated based upon actual historical stock price movements over the most recent periods equal to the expected option term 
expected pre vesting forfeitures are estimated based on actual historical pre vesting forfeitures over the most recent periods for the expected option term

consolidated gross profit as a percentage of revenue was during compared to during the prior year 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the overall growth of the company and included approximately million of increased salary  incentive  benefits and other associated employee expenses  approximately million of increased office expenses  approximately million of higher professional service expenses  and approximately million of increased insurance  contract labor and other general expenses 
included as part of increased employee expenses during is approximately million of compensation expense recorded pursuant to sfas no 
r  which was adopted on january  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased to approximately during compared to approximately during the prior year period 
other income and expense other income and expense was million of income during compared to million of income during  due to approximately million of additional gains on sales of assets in the current year period 
this increase was partially offset by approximately million of decreased other income  consisting primarily of decreased gains from foreign currency fluctuations and decreased earnings from an unconsolidated joint venture 
interest expense and income taxes net interest expense increased from million during to million during due to the significant borrowings of long term debt used to fund the company s capital expenditure requirements and acquisitions during the past two years 
future periods will continue to reflect the increased interest expense associated with these additional borrowings until they are repaid 
the company s provision for income taxes during increased to million compared to million during the prior year  primarily due to increased earnings 
net income net income before discontinued operations was million during compared to million during  an increase of million 
net income per diluted share before discontinued operations was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  the company made the decision to discontinue its venezuelan fluids and production testing businesses due to several factors  including the changing political climate in that country 
net loss from discontinued operations per diluted share during was compared to a net income per diluted share of during  primarily due to decreased activity levels 
net income was million during compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million 
net income per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding during compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year 
divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues increased from million during to million during  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to increased product pricing and service activity  which more than offset the decreased production from the company s lake charles calcium chloride manufacturing facility  which began operating at a reduced level beginning in late  due to the loss of a major raw material supplier 
fluids division gross profit increased significantly to million during  compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from during the prior year to during the current year 
this increase was primarily due to the increased prices  a more favorable mix of higher margin products and services  and the sale of lower cost inventory during the period 
inventory costs have increased during for the division s products and raw materials 
although a favorable long range supply for certain of the division s raw material needs has been secured  the division s margins are expected to be significantly reduced in due to higher near term inventory costs during the transition to this new favorable supply 
fluids division income before taxes during totaled million compared to million in the prior year  an increase of million or 
this increase was generated by the million increase in gross profit discussed above  which was partially offset by approximately million of increased administrative expenses  approximately million of decreased gains on sales of assets  and approximately million of decreased gains on foreign currency fluctuations 
wa d division wa d division revenues increased to million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
the division s wa d services segment revenues increased to million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
this increase was primarily due to the increased well abandonment and decommissioning activity in the gulf of mexico region following the significant hurricanes during the third quarter of as well as the division s increased capacity to serve its customers 
approximately million of this increase is from increased work performed for maritech  and is eliminated in consolidation 
the division anticipates continued increased demand for its services  as operators repair or decommission damaged platforms and pipelines and accelerate their abandonment and decommissioning plans due  in part  to the risk of future storm damage and due to the increased insurance costs related to offshore assets 
to increase its capacity to provide services  the division purchased the db derrick barge in february  made extensive repairs and modifications to one of its existing vessels  and entered into arrangements to lease three additional vessels the anna iv  which was utilized from march to november  the orion  which was leased beginning in july  and the achiever  which was leased beginning in september the db was refurbished and it began operating in july the orion and the achiever were placed in service beginning september and october  respectively 
the march acquisition of the assets of epic  a full service diving operation  contributed approximately million of revenues during subsequent to the acquisition of epic  the division purchased and subsequently refurbished a dynamically positioned dive support vessel  renamed the epic diver  and refurbished two other epic dive support vessels 
each of these vessels was placed in service during the first quarter of  and is expected to contribute additional revenues in the future 
the epic acquisition allows the division to provide additional services to its customers  including maritech  and to supply a substantial portion of such services for wa d services operations 
the division s maritech segment reported revenues of million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
approximately million of this increase is from increased production volumes primarily due to acquisitions of producing properties and successful exploitation and development activities 
during the third quarter of  maritech acquired producing oil and gas properties in three significant acquisitions 
beginning in the last half of the third quarter of  production from a majority of maritech s producing properties  including its newly acquired properties  was shut in as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita  which caused varying levels of damage to the majority of its offshore production platforms and destroyed three of its platforms and one of its production facilities 
while the vast majority of maritech s properties have resumed production  a small portion of maritech s daily production remains shut in 
in addition  maritech s revenues increased approximately million during as a result of higher realized oil and gas commodity prices compared to the prior year period 
also  maritech reported million of increased prospect fee and service revenue during the current year period 
realized natural gas prices during include the impact of a natural gas swap derivative hedge contract which resulted in maritech realizing a price of mmbtu throughout the year for a portion of its gas production 
this derivative contract expired as of december  in february  maritech entered into a new natural gas hedge for a portion of its remaining natural gas production at an average price of mmbtu 
wa d division gross profit during totaled million compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
the wa d services segment of the division reported a million increase in gross profit  from million during to million during the current year 
wa d services gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased to during the current year compared to during the prior year  primarily due to increased operating expenses caused by weather disruptions 
in addition  the wa d services segment also incurred certain expenses related to the expansion of its heavy lift vessel fleet and the refurbishment of one of its existing heavy lift vessels and several of its dive support vessels 
these increased costs were more than offset by the overall increase in segment revenues  and by diving and support operations  which contributed million of segment gross profit 
the division s increased vessel fleet and the addition of the epic diving operations are expected to provide additional efficiencies in the future  as the division attempts to capitalize on the current market demand for its services 
the division s maritech segment reported gross profit of million during compared to million during  a million increase 
maritech s gross profit as a percentage of revenues also increased significantly during the current year to compared to during the prior year 
the significant growth in maritech s production volumes primarily resulting from the acquisitions completed during the third quarter of  plus the increased realized commodity prices discussed above was partially offset by approximately million of increased operating expenses  including approximately million of increased depreciation  depletion  and accretion costs primarily associated with production from the newly acquired and developed properties 
this increase in operating expenses also includes approximately million of increased insurance premium costs and approximately million of well intervention costs and other hurricane damage repair costs  charged to earnings  which the company believes will not be reimbursed under its insurance coverage 
such costs were either incurred during the period or have been reflected as increased decommissioning liabilities on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
partially offsetting these increases  the company included approximately million of increased gain associated with insurance claim proceeds in excess of the net carrying value of destroyed assets 
in addition  during  maritech reported an impairment charge of approximately million as required under successful efforts accounting 
the division has completed most of the required repairs to its damaged platform facilities  and has performed certain well intervention operations on wells associated with two of the three destroyed platforms 
maritech is currently assessing the extent of the damages related to the third destroyed platform  as well as the debris removal effort for each of the destroyed platforms 
maritech expects to continue these efforts and resume its well intervention and debris removal operations in and beyond 
the company believes that substantially all of the repair and well intervention and debris removal costs associated with the hurricane damage  other than the applicable deductibles and the amount charged to earnings discussed above  will be covered under the company s various insurance policies 
wa d division income before taxes was million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
wa d services segment income before taxes increased to million during compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
this increase was due to the million increase in gross profit described above  less approximately million primarily from increased administrative expenses  including the administrative expenses incurred during the year associated with epic s operations 
the division s maritech segment reported income before taxes of million during compared to million during the prior year  a million increase 
this increase was due to the million increase in gross profit discussed above and million of increased gains on sales of properties compared to the prior year period  partially offset by million of increased administrative costs associated with maritech s growth 
production enhancement division production enhancement division revenues increased million during compared to the prior year  from million during to million during the current year 
this increase was primarily due to the increased revenues from the division s compressco and production testing operations 
the division s production testing operations revenues increased by million during compared to the prior year  due to the first quarter acquisition of beacon  the increased activity from its domestic customers  and from recent growth of its latin american operations  including its operation in brazil 
compressco revenues increased by million compared to the prior year  due to its overall growth domestically  as well as in canada and mexico

income before taxes for the production enhancement division increased  from million during the prior year to million during  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to the increased gross profit discussed above  plus million of increased gains from currency fluctuation  less million of increased administrative costs primarily associated with beacon and compressco  plus million of decreased gains on asset sales 
corporate overhead corporate overhead includes corporate general and administrative expenses  corporate depreciation and amortization  interest income and expense  and other income and expense 
such expenses and income are not allocated to the company s operating divisions  as they relate to the company s general corporate activities 
corporate overhead increased from million during to million during  primarily due to the acquisitions and the staff growth resulting from the expansion of its existing businesses 
this growth resulted in increased administrative costs of million 
the increase in administrative costs resulted from million of increased salary  incentive  benefit  and other associated employee expenses  including million of compensation expense required under the recently adopted sfas no 
r  million of increased professional fee expenses  and million of increased office  insurance  and other general expenses 
total estimated unrecognized compensation cost from unvested stock options pursuant to sfas no 
r as of december  was approximately million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
corporate interest expense during increased by million compared to the prior year due to the increased outstanding balance of long term debt  which was used to fund the company s capital expenditure program and the acquisitions completed during the third quarter of and the first quarter of compared to consolidated comparisons revenues and gross profit total consolidated revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million during the prior year  an increase of

consolidated gross profit as a percent of revenues was during  compared to during the prior year 
general and administrative expenses consolidated general and administrative expenses were million during  an increase of million or compared to the increase was primarily due to the overall growth of the company  with a large portion of the increase attributable to the addition of the compressco and tce operations  which were acquired during the third quarter of the increased general and administrative expenses included million of increased salary  incentive  benefit and other associated employee expenses  approximately million of higher professional service expenses  million of increased office expenses  million of increased bad debt expense  and approximately million of other general expense increases 
due to the significant increase in the company s operating revenues  however  general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue decreased to during  compared to during the prior year 
other income and expense other income and expense was million of income during  compared to million of income during the prior year period  an increase of million 
the increase was primarily due to million of increased net gains on sales of assets  million of increased equity in the earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures  and approximately million primarily from increased foreign currency gains 
interest expense and income taxes net interest expense was million during  primarily due to significant borrowings of long term debt used to fund a portion of the company s acquisitions during the third quarter of during the first half of  the company had no long term debt balances outstanding other than minimal amounts related to capitalized leases 
in addition  the company increased its long term debt borrowings by million during  as borrowings related to the closing of a maritech oil and gas property acquisition during the third quarter of and other working capital needs during the fourth quarter of more than offset the million of debt repayments during the year 
the company s provision for income taxes during increased to million  compared to million during the prior year  primarily due to increased earnings 
net income income before discontinued operations was million during  compared to million in the prior year  an increase of 
income per diluted share before discontinued operations was on  average diluted shares outstanding during  compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year

the company reported net income from discontinued operations per diluted share of during and net income was million during  compared to million during the prior year 
net income per diluted share was on  average diluted shares outstanding during  compared to on  average diluted shares outstanding in the prior year 
divisional comparisons fluids division fluids division revenues increased significantly  from million during to million during  an increase of million  or 
the impact from including a full year of operations of tce  which was acquired in september  resulted in approximately million of this increase 
increased product pricing  sales volumes  and service activity generated an additional increase of approximately million in revenues 
in october  one of the division s main raw material suppliers announced that it had permanently ceased production from its tdi plant in lake charles  louisiana 
this plant supplied feedstock to the division s lake charles calcium chloride manufacturing facility  which generated approximately of the division s revenues during fluids division gross profit increased from million during to million during  an increase of million  or 
gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased from during to during such increases were primarily due to increased product sales volumes  a more favorable mix of higher margin products and services  and increased prices during the period  which offset the impact of higher product costs 
in addition  the inclusion of the tce operations for the full year contributed an increase of approximately million 
given the increased cost of raw materials for its products  and the potential higher cost of alternative feedstock supply for the division s lake charles manufacturing facility  future levels of gross profit for the fluids division will be impacted by the division s ability to pass along these increased costs to its customers through higher product prices 
fluids division income before taxes during increased by million  totaling million  compared to million during  an increase of 
this increase was generated by the million increase in gross profit discussed above  million of gain from disposal of certain international assets  approximately million of increased foreign currency gains  and million of equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures 
these increases were partially offset by approximately million of increased administrative expenses  including a full year of administrative expenses of tce 
wa d division wa d division revenues increased to million during  compared to million during the prior year  an increase of million or 
the division s wa d services operations revenues increased by million  from million during to million during  an increase of 
this increase was primarily due to the increased activity of the division s well abandonment and decommissioning operations  particularly in the gulf of mexico and inland waters region 
the division s decommissioning operations were able to capitalize on the increased activity levels following the purchase of the arapaho  a heavy lift barge with an ton capacity crane 
as a result of the hurricane damage experienced by many offshore operators during the third quarter of  the division anticipates increased demand for its services  as operators repair or decommission damaged platforms or escalate their abandonment and decommissioning plans due to the risk of future storms and the associated increasing insurance costs 
the division s maritech operations reported revenues of million during  compared to million during  an increase of million  or 
this increase was due to approximately million from higher realized oil and gas sales prices compared to the prior year period  a million increase from increased production volumes primarily due to acquisitions of producing properties and a million increase from prospect fee revenue recorded during during the third quarter of  maritech and its subsidiaries consummated three significant acquisitions of producing properties 
beginning in the last half of the third quarter of  production from a majority of maritech s producing properties  including its newly acquired properties  was shut in as a result of hurricanes katrina and rita

the division s maritech operations reported gross profit of million during  compared to million during  a million decrease 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues decreased during to  compared to during increased commodity prices were more than offset by approximately million of increased operating expenses and an impairment charge of approximately million during the increased operating expenses were primarily due to the producing properties acquired during and include an increase in the associated depreciation  depletion and accretion costs 
as a result of the timing of these acquisitions  such increased operating expenses were incurred during the last four months of  when a significant portion of maritech s production was shut in following the hurricanes 
maritech suffered varying levels of damage to the majority of its offshore production platforms  and three of its platforms and one of its production facilities were completely destroyed

during this period  the company has generated approximately million of net cash flow from operating activities  million of proceeds from asset sales and other investing activities  and million of long term debt borrowings  which it used to fund approximately million of capital expenditures  million of business acquisitions  and million of debt repayments 
this growth strategy has resulted in the company reflecting total assets of approximately billion and total long term debt outstanding of approximately million as of december  during  the company invested a total of approximately million in investing activities  including approximately million for the acquisition of epic  beacon  and arrowhead  and approximately million of capital expenditures  including the purchase of a heavy lift barge 
to fund a portion of this growth  the company issued private placement debt in april to supplement its revolving credit facility 
in addition  the company increased its borrowings under its revolving credit facility  and in december the company s credit facility was expanded by million 
the substantial majority of the company s outstanding debt  including the a senior notes  mature no earlier than the company anticipates capital expenditure activity in of approximately million to further grow its operations 
the company continues to generate increased operating cash flow from each of its operating divisions  which it plans to use to fund a majority of these anticipated capital expenditures 
cash flow in excess of the company s capital expenditures will be used principally to reduce the outstanding balance under its credit facility  which was approximately million as of february  the company has additional borrowing capacity of approximately million as of february   and believes it has various options to additionally expand its capital resources should the need arise 
operating activities cash flow generated by operating activities totaled approximately million during compared to approximately million during the prior year 
operating cash flow during was net of approximately million of cash expended for increased inventories primarily related to the company s fluids division  reflecting increased volumes and higher product costs 
operating cash flow was also net of approximately million of increased accounts receivable during  due largely to increased amounts pursuant to insured hurricane repair costs and overall growth in revenues 
these increases to inventories and accounts receivable were significantly greater than the similar amounts during the prior year 
in addition  excess tax benefits totaling million associated with stock options exercised during are now classified as cash flows from financing activities pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
r 
the company s acquisitions of beacon and the assets and operations of epic contributed to the company s operating cash flow during the db heavy lift derrick barge  which the company acquired in february  began operations in july operations from two recently leased derrick barges  and the recently acquired assets and operations of arrowhead  began to contribute additional operating cash flow beginning in the fourth quarter of future operating cash flow is also largely dependent upon the level of oil and gas industry activity  particularly in the gulf of mexico region of the us the company s increased revenues from its existing businesses during reflect the increased demand for a majority of the company s products and services  and the company expects that such demand will continue to be relatively high during the operating cash flow impact from this increased demand is limited or partially offset  however  by the increased product  operating  and administrative costs required to deliver its products and services and the company s equipment and personnel capacity constraints 
as a result of the significant hurricanes that occurred during the third quarter of  the company suffered damage to certain of its fluids facilities and to certain of its decommissioning assets  including one of its heavy lift barges 
maritech suffered varying levels of damage to the majority of its offshore oil and gas producing platforms  and three of its platforms and one of its production facilities were completely destroyed 
the majority of company assets damaged during the hurricanes have been repaired  however  the company is continuing to assess the extent of certain damages  particularly the well intervention and removal of debris costs associated with the destroyed maritech platforms 
the company estimates that total storm related costs  including the well intervention  removal of debris  and other costs associated with the three destroyed platforms  and repair costs of other damaged assets  will range between to million 
as of december   a cumulative total of approximately million of these costs have been incurred  and approximately million of insurance claims have been reimbursed to the company under its various insurance policies 
subsequent to december   an additional million of storm related costs have been reimbursed 
the remaining costs are expected to be incurred in and beyond 
approximately to million of the estimated storm related costs consist of the well intervention  debris removal  and other costs related to the three destroyed maritech offshore platforms 
the company s estimate of total well intervention costs to be incurred has increased following the work performed during on wells associated with two of the destroyed platforms 
this revised estimate of well intervention costs exceeds the maximum coverage amount for such costs provided pursuant to the company s applicable insurance policies 
certain future costs to be incurred may also not be reimbursable 
in addition  for repair and well intervention expenditures that are covered by insurance  the collection of insurance claims may be delayed  resulting in the temporary use of the company s capital resources to fund such efforts 
as of december   repair  well intervention  and certain non storm related expenditures incurred in excess of deductibles and anticipated to qualify for insurance reimbursement totaled approximately million and are included in accounts receivable  pending the collection of the company s insurance claims 
such amount is net of the approximately million of claims reimbursed to the company as of december  the company is working with its insurance underwriters to provide information and documentation regarding its claims for coverage in an effort to obtain reimbursement under these claims as expediently as possible  however  the timing of the collection of such claims is beyond the company s control 
the company s insurance coverage premiums have significantly increased as a result of the storms  and its current coverage includes higher deductibles and reduced maximum coverage amounts compared to its previous coverage 
future operating cash flow will also be affected by the commodity prices received for maritech s oil and gas production and the timing of expenditures required for the plugging  abandonment and decommissioning of maritech s oil and gas properties 
maritech has entered into oil and gas commodity derivative transactions that extend through and are designed to hedge a portion of maritech s operating cash flows from risks associated with the fluctuating prices of oil and gas 
the third party discounted fair value  including an estimated profit  of maritech s decommissioning liability as of december  totals million million undiscounted 
the cash outflow necessary to extinguish maritech s decommissioning liability is expected to occur over several years  shortly after the end of each property s productive life 
this timing of these cash outflows is estimated based on future oil and gas production and the resulting depletion of the company s oil and gas reserves 
such estimates are imprecise and subject to change due to changing commodity prices  revisions of reserve estimates and other factors 
the company s decommissioning liability is net of amounts allocable to joint interest owners and any contractual amounts to be paid by the previous owners of the properties 
in some cases  the previous owners are contractually obligated to pay maritech a fixed amount for the future well abandonment and decommissioning work on these properties as the work is performed  partially offsetting maritech s future obligation expenditures 
as of december   maritech s total undiscounted decommissioning obligation is approximately million and consists of maritech s liability of million plus approximately million  which is contractually required to be reimbursed to maritech pursuant to such contractual arrangements with the previous owners

the arrowhead acquisition expanded a portion of the company s fluids services operations 
the above transactions were primarily funded by long term borrowings 
the company plans to expend an estimated million on additional capital additions during the significant majority of such planned capital expenditures is related to identified opportunities to grow and expand the company s existing businesses  and may be postponed or cancelled as conditions change 
projects planned during include the initial phase of the development of the company s el dorado  arkansas calcium chloride facility and the expansion of the west memphis  arkansas brominated fluids production facility 
in addition to the above capital expenditure plans  the company s growth strategy continues to include the pursuit of suitable acquisitions or opportunities to establish operations in additional niche oil and gas service markets 
to the extent the company consummates a significant acquisition  its liquidity position will be affected 
the company expects to fund its capital expenditure activity through cash flows from operations and from its bank credit facility 
should additional capital be required  the company believes that it has the ability to raise such capital through the issuance of additional debt or equity 
total cash capital expenditures of approximately million during included approximately million by the wa d division 
during  the company s wa d services segment expended approximately million for the purchase of a heavy lift derrick barge  approximately million for the purchase of a saturation dive vessel  and approximately million primarily for vessel construction and refurbishment costs 
in addition  approximately million was spent by the division primarily related to exploitation and development expenditures on maritech s offshore oil and gas properties 
the production enhancement division spent approximately million  consisting of approximately million related to compressco compressor fleet expansion  approximately million to replace and enhance a portion of the production testing equipment fleet  and approximately million for process services capital projects 
the fluids division reflected approximately million of capital expenditures  primarily related to plant expansion projects during the year 
corporate capital expenditures were approximately million 
in addition to its continuing capital expenditure program  maritech continues to pursue the purchase of additional producing oil and gas properties as part of the company s strategy to support its wa d services operations 
while future purchases of such properties are also expected to be primarily funded through the assumption of the associated decommissioning liabilities  the transactions may also involve the payment or receipt of cash at closing or the receipt of cash when associated well abandonment and decommissioning work is performed in the future
