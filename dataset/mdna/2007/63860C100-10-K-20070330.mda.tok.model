we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  and other available financing sources  will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure needs for business operations for the next months 
factors which could negatively affect our liquidity include a reduction in the demand for our products  a reduction in medicare reimbursement for our products  as well as those factors set forth in item a entitled risk factors

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
to prepare these financial statements we are required to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
these estimates include assessing the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns and allowances  determination of appropriate medicare reimbursement rates and the valuation allowance for costs related to billings in process 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ materially from the estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
while all accounting policies impact the financial statements  certain policies may be viewed as critical 
critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the portrayal of financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most subjective or complex judgments and estimates 
we believe the policies that fall within this category are our policies on revenue recognition and accounts receivable  allowances for doubtful accounts  allowances for costs related to billings in process and patient acquisition and related costs 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable medical product sales we record revenue for our medical products segment at amounts expected to be collected from medicare  other third party payors  and directly from patients 
we analyze various factors in determining revenue recognition  including  review of specific transactions  current medicare regulations and reimbursement rates  and the credit worthiness of patients 
we recognize revenue related to product sales upon shipment of patient orders  provided that risk of loss has passed to the patient and the required written forms to bill medicare  other third party payors and patients have been received and verified 
revenue is not recognized for product shipments until that period in which the required documentation has been collected and verified 
the costs related to these billings in process  consisting of the cost of products shipped  are deferred and charged to cost of product sales at the time the related revenue is recognized 
medicare reimbursement payments are sometimes lower than the reimbursement payments of other third party payors  such as traditional indemnity insurance companies 
medicare reimbursements are subject to review by appropriate government regulators 
revenue for medicare reimbursement is calculated based on government determined prices  and amounts billed in excess of the government determined reimbursement are excluded from revenue and  therefore  estimates of contractual adjustments are not required 
medicare reimburses at of the government determined reimbursement prices for reimbursable products and the remaining balance is billed to either other third party payors or directly to patients 
to the extent that estimated medicare allowable amounts used as the basis for recording revenue differ from actual reimbursement  revenue is adjusted in the period reimbursement is received  although such adjustments have historically not been significant 

table of contents we record sales allowances for estimated claim denials related to unsettled amounts from medicare and other third party payors as a reduction of gross revenue 
allowances for claim denials are estimated based upon historical claim denial experience  and the rate at which we provide for such allowances is periodically adjusted to reflect actual claim denials and current trends 
for the year ended december   a hypothetical change of in the provision for claim denials as a percentage of gross product sales would have resulted in a change in our revenue and net loss of approximately million 
we also establish reserves for estimated product returns  which are recorded as a reduction of gross revenue 
reserves for returns are estimated based upon historical returns experience and current trends  and changes in these factors could affect the timing and amount of revenue recognition in future periods 
cigna agreement we began recognizing revenue for our services to cigna in offering its national medicare part d prescription drug plans to medicare beneficiaries in the third quarter of revenue recognized under our agreement with cigna is recognized when earned as the services are performed and is presented in our consolidated statements of operations as service revenue 
revenue recognition is based upon the fee structure and reimbursement provisions of the agreement  pursuant to which  through the end of  we shared in the operating results of the program  in addition to recouping start up costs related to the program 
allowances for doubtful accounts accounts receivable primarily relate to our medical products segment and are stated net of estimated allowances for doubtful accounts  which are established based upon historical experience and current trends 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for accounts receivable balances  management makes assumptions with respect to future collectibility 
we base our estimates of accounts receivable collectibility on our historical collection and write off experience  our credit policies  and our analysis of accounts receivable by aging category within each payor class 
changes in judgment regarding these factors will cause the level of accounts receivable allowances to be adjusted 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due from medicare  secondary insurance and other third party payors  and patients 
the typical collection process begins with the electronic submission of a claim to medicare  for which a response and payment is obtained within days 
any claim denials from medicare are generally acted upon within a day period following the response and  where applicable  corrected claims are submitted to medicare or third party insurance carriers 
a response and payment for amounts billed to secondary and other third party insurance carriers generally occurs within days of submission of the claim 
on a monthly basis  an aging of outstanding third party payor balances is generated and worked by collection personnel  including contacting the patient and or insurance company in an attempt to determine why payment has not been remitted and obtain payment from the respective responsible party 
when applicable  corrected claims are submitted to the insurance carrier 
collection personnel also continually analyze patients accounts and patient statements are generated and sent out monthly 
outbound calls are periodically made to patients with outstanding balances greater than in an attempt to obtain payment 
the collection process is time consuming and complex and typically involves the submission of claims to multiple payors whose payment of claims may be dependent upon the payment of another payor 
as a result  our collection efforts may be active for up to months from the initial billing date 
in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements  we make reasonable and appropriate efforts to collect our accounts receivable  including deductible and co payment amounts  in a consistent manner for all payor classes 
uncollectible account balances for all payor classes are written off after remaining unpaid for a period of months 
balances that are determined to be uncollectible prior to the passage of months from the last billing date are written off at the time of such determination 

table of contents we perform eligibility and insurance verification on patients prior to the shipment of products and submission of a claim 
as a result  we do not have amounts that are pending approval from third party payors outside of the typical review process for submitted claims 
the following tables set forth our gross accounts receivable balances outstanding by aging category for each major payor source as of december  and in thousands aging of accounts receivable as of december  payor days days days days total medicare commercial parties and medicaid patients other total gross accounts receivable less allowances accounts receivable  net aging of accounts receivable as of december  payor days days days days total medicare commercial parties and medicaid patients other total gross accounts receivable less allowances accounts receivable  net primarily represents amounts due from cigna and other clients of our insurance services segment 
primarily represents amounts due from the third party claims adjudicator for our discount prescription drug card business 
allowances for costs related to billings in process our medical supply patients sometimes request supplies before we have received the required written forms to bill medicare and other third party payors 
we generally ship products to these patients but defer the revenue and costs related to such billings in process until all required forms have been obtained and verified 
these costs  which include the cost of products shipped  are presented net of a valuation allowance based upon our historical experience with the collection of documents required to bill medicare and other payors 
provisions for such valuation allowance are treated as patient acquisition costs  and changes in judgment regarding the recoverability of costs related to billings in process could result in fluctuations in the level of patient acquisition and related costs 
the costs related to billings in process are charged to cost of product sales at the time the related revenue is recognized 

table of contents patient acquisition and related costs patient acquisition and related costs represent the costs we incur in the development of our medical products patient base  including direct response television advertising 
in accordance with aicpa statement of position sop no 
 reporting on advertising costs  we expense such advertising costs as incurred 
direct response advertising costs meeting the capitalization criteria of sop are required to be reported as an asset and amortized over the future benefit period 
we do not meet the criteria for capitalization as we are not able to demonstrate a direct link between specific sales to patients and specific advertising expenditures such that it is reasonable to conclude that the advertising will result in probable future benefits probable future revenue 
this accounting treatment generally results in advertising expenses being charged to earnings in periods prior to the recognition of the associated revenue 
the costs of acquiring patient lists are capitalized as an intangible asset and amortized on a straight line basis over a period of three years
