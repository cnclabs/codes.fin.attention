table of contents item a 
risk factors the matters relating to the audit committee of the board s review of our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements have required us to incur substantial expenses  have resulted in litigation  and may result in additional litigation 
on july   the company announced that the audit committee of the company s board of directors  with the assistance of independent legal counsel  was conducting a review of our stock option practices covering the time from the company s initial public offering in through june as described in note restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements in notes to consolidated financial statements in the form k  the audit committee reached a conclusion that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for stock option grants in certain prior periods 
as a result  the company has recorded additional non cash stock based compensation expense  and related tax effects  related to certain stock option grants  and the company has restated certain previously filed financial statements included in the annual report on form k 
this review of our historical stock option granting practices has required us to incur substantial expenses for legal  accounting  tax and other professional services  has diverted our management s attention from our business  and any litigation or future government enforcement actions could in the future adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
our historical stock option granting practices and the restatement of our prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation proceedings 
several derivative complaints have been filed pertaining to allegations relating to stock option grants 
we cannot assure you that these or future similar complaints or any future litigation or regulatory action will result in the same conclusions reached by the audit committee 
the conduct and resolution of these matters will be time consuming  expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business 
we contacted the sec regarding the audit committee s review and  in july  the sec commenced an investigation into our historical stock option grant practices 
in november  a representative of the audit committee and its informal advisors met with the enforcement staff of the sec and provided them with a report of the audit committee s investigation and findings 
in january  the enforcement staff of the sec notified the company that its investigation had been terminated and no enforcement action had been recommended to the commission 
the findings of the audit committee s review are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements and in item a of the annual report on form k for the year ended september  prior to  we were not profitable and we may incur losses in the future  which may raise vendor viability concerns thereby making it more difficult to close license transactions with new and existing customers 
while the company was profitable in the amount of million for the year ended september   we incurred losses of million and million for the years ended september  and  respectively 
as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we may incur losses in future periods and cannot be certain that we can generate sufficient revenues to maintain profitability 
continued losses may leave many customers reluctant to enter into new large value license transactions without some assurance that we will operate profitably 
if we fail to enter into new large value license transactions due to viability concerns  our revenues will decline  which could further adversely affect our operating results 
because a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our revenues  the loss of a significant customer could cause a substantial decline in our revenues 
we derive a significant portion of our license and service revenues from a limited number of customers 
the loss of a major customer could cause a decrease in revenues and net income 
for the year ended september   citicorp credit services  inc and international business machines ibm accounted for and of our total revenue  respectively 
while our customer concentration has fluctuated  we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues in any given period 
as a result  if we lose a major customer  or if a contract is delayed or cancelled or we do not contract with new major customers  our revenues and net income would be adversely affected 
in addition  customers that have accounted for significant revenues in the past may not generate revenues in any future period  causing our failure to obtain new significant customers or additional orders from existing customers to materially affect our operating results 

table of contents if we fail to adequately address the difficulties of managing our international operations  our revenues and operating expenses will be adversely affected 
for the year ended september   international revenues were million or approximately of our total revenues 
while north american revenues have increased recently as a percentage of our overall revenues  international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
we have faced  and will continue to face  difficulties in managing international operations which include difficulties in hiring qualified local personnel  seasonal fluctuations in customer orders  longer accounts receivable collection cycles  expenses associated with licensing products and servicing customers in foreign markets  economic downturns and political uncertainty in international economies  income tax withholding issues in countries in which we do not have a physical presence  resulting in non recoverable tax payments  complex transfer pricing arrangements between legal entities  doing business and licensing our software to customers in countries with weaker intellectual property protection laws and enforcement capabilities  and difficulties in commencing new operations in countries where the company has not previously conducted business  including those associated with tax laws  employment laws  government regulation  product warranty laws and adopting to local customs and culture 
any of these factors could have a significant impact on our ability to license products on a competitive and timely basis and could adversely affect our operating expenses and net income 
additionally  we closed our only french office in fiscal year the absence of a business office in france may harm our ability to attract and retain customers in that country 
our known backlog of business may not result in revenue 
an increasingly material portion of our revenues has been derived from large orders  as major customers deployed our products 
we define backlog as contractual commitments by our customers through purchase orders or contracts 
backlog is comprised of software license orders which have not been accepted by customers or have not otherwise met all of the required criteria for revenue recognition  deferred revenue from customer support contracts  and deferred consulting and education orders for services not yet completed or delivered 
backlog is not necessarily indicative of revenues to be recognized in a specified future period 
there are many factors that would impact the company s filling of backlog  such as the company s progress in completing projects for its customers and chordiant s customers meeting anticipated schedules for customer dependent deliverables 
the company provides no assurances that any portion of its backlog will be filled during any fiscal year or at all or that its backlog will be recognized as revenues in any given period 
in addition  it is possible that customers from whom we expect to derive revenue from backlog will default and as a result we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog 
fluctuations in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows 
a significant portion of our sales and operating expenses result from transactions outside of the united states  often in foreign currencies 
these currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro and the canadian dollar 
our international sales comprised of our total sales for the year ended september  our international sales comprised of our total sales for the year ended september  our future operating results will continue to be subject to fluctuations in foreign currency rates  especially if international sales grow as a percentage of our total sales  and we may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency rates in the future 
for the year ended september   we had an unrealized foreign currency transaction gain of approximately million 
see item a for further discussion about foreign currency risk 

table of contents geopolitical concerns could make the closing of license transactions with new and existing customers difficult 
our revenues may decrease in fiscal year or beyond if we are unable to enter into new large scale license transactions with new and existing customers 
the current state of world affairs and geopolitical concerns have left many customers reluctant to enter into new large value license transactions without some assurance that the economy both in the customer s home country and worldwide will have some economic and political stability 
geopolitical instability will continue to make closing large license transactions difficult 
in addition  we cannot predict what effect the us military presence overseas or potential or actual political or military conflict have had or are continuing to have on our existing and prospective customers decision making process with respect to licensing or implementing enterprise level products such as ours 
our ability to enter into new large license transactions also directly affects our ability to create additional consulting services and post customer support revenues  on which we also depend 
competition in our markets is intense and could reduce our sales and prevent us from achieving profitability 
increased competition in our markets could result in price reductions for our products and services  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could reduce our future revenues 
the market for our products is intensely competitive  evolving and subject to rapid technological change 
historically  our primary competition has been from internal development  custom systems integration projects and application software competitors 
in particular  we compete with internal information technology departments in house information technology departments of potential customers have developed or may develop systems that provide some or all of the functionality of our products 
we expect that internally developed application integration and process automation efforts will continue to be a significant source of competition 
custom systems integration projects we compete with large systems integrators who may develop custom solutions for specific companies which may reduce the likelihood that they would purchase our products and services 
point application vendors we compete with providers of stand alone point solutions for web based customer relationship management and traditional client server based  call center service customer and sales force automation solution providers 
in addition  recent continuing consolidation in the software industry during may indicate that we will face new competitors in the future 
within the year oracle announced the acquisitions of agile software  an enterprise solutions software maker and hyperion software  a business performance software maker 
also in  ibm acquired palisades  a provider of lending software to companies in the mortgage industry and sap has made an offer to purchase business objects 
in  ibm acquired webify  a provider of middleware to companies primarily in the insurance industry 
in january  oracle acquired siebel systems  inc  a maker of customer relationship management software products and acquired portal software  a provider of billing and revenue management solutions for the communications and media industry 
siebel systems  inc was a competitor of ours 
in september  ibm had acquired dwl  a provider of middleware to companies in the banking  insurance  retail and telecommunications industries 
in  oracle acquired i flex solutions  ltd  a banking software maker headquartered in mumbai  india 
while we do not believe that agile software  hyperion software  palisades  webify  portal software  dwl  or i flex solutions have been significant competitors of chordiant in the past  the acquisition of these companies by oracle and ibm may indicate that we will face increased competition from significantly larger and more established entities in the future 
many of our competitors have greater resources and broader customer relationships than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors have extensive knowledge of our industry 
current and potential competitors have established  or may establish  cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to offer a single solution and to increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
we may experience a shortfall in bookings  revenue  earnings  cash flow or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business and the market price of our common stock 
our revenues and operating results may fluctuate significantly because of a number of factors  many of which are outside of our control 
some of these factors include size and timing of individual license transactions  delay or deferral of customer implementations of our products and subsequent impact on revenues  lengthening of our sales cycle  
table of contents potential deterioration and changes in domestic and foreign markets and economies  success in expanding our global services organization  direct sales force and indirect distribution channels  timing of new product introductions and product enhancements  appropriate mix of products licensed and services sold  levels of international transactions  activities of and acquisitions by competitors  product and price competition  and our ability to develop and market new products and control costs 
one or more of the foregoing factors may cause our operating expenses to be disproportionately high during any given period or may cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate significantly 
based upon the preceding factors  we may experience a shortfall in revenues and earnings or otherwise fail to meet public market expectations  which could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and the market price of our common stock 
our operating results and cash flows fluctuate significantly and delays in delivery or implementation of our products or changes in the payment terms with customers may cause unanticipated declines in revenues or cash flow  which could disappoint investors and result in a decline in our stock price 
our quarterly revenues depend primarily upon product implementation by our customers 
we have historically recognized a significant portion of our license and services revenue through the percentage of completion method  using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress towards completion of implementation of our products and we expect this practice to continue 
the percentage of completion accounting method requires ongoing estimates of progress of complicated and frequently changing technology projects 
documenting the measure of progress towards completion of implementation is subject to potential errors and changes in estimates 
as a result  even minor errors or minor changes in estimates may lead to significant changes in accounting results which may be revised in later quarters due to subsequent information and events 
thus  delays or changes in customer business goals or direction when implementing our software may adversely impact our quarterly revenue 
additionally  we may increasingly enter into term  subscription or transaction based licensing transactions that would cause us to recognize license revenue for such transactions over a longer period of time than we have historically experienced for our perpetual licenses 
in addition  a significant portion of new customer orders have been booked in the third month of each calendar quarter  with many of these bookings occurring in the last two weeks of the third month 
we expect this trend to continue and  therefore  any failure or delay in bookings would decrease our quarterly revenue and cash flows 
the terms and conditions of individual license agreements with customers vary from transaction to transaction 
historically  the company has been able to obtain prepayments for product in some cases 
other transactions link payment to the delivery or acceptance of products 
if we are unable to negotiate prepayments of fees our cash flows and financial ratios with respect to accounts receivable would be adversely impacted 
if our revenues  operating margins or cash flows are below the expectations of the investment community  our stock price is likely to decline 
if we fail to maintain and expand our relationships with systems integrators and other business partners  our ability to develop  market  sell  and support our products may be adversely affected 
our development  marketing and distribution strategies rely on our ability to form and maintain long term strategic relationships with systems integrators  in particular  our existing business alliance partners  ibm  and accenture 
these business relationships often consist of joint marketing programs  technology partnerships and resale and distribution arrangements 
although most aspects of these relationships are contractual in nature  many important aspects of these relationships depend on the continued cooperation between the parties 
divergence in strategy  change in focus  competitive product offerings or potential contract defaults may interfere with our ability to develop  market  sell  or support our products  which in turn could harm our business 
if either ibm or accenture were to terminate their agreements with us or our relationship were to deteriorate  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence the decisions of these customers 
a number of our competitors have stronger relationships with ibm and accenture and  as a result  these systems integrators may be more likely to recommend competitors products and services 
in addition  in september  ibm had acquired dwl  a provider of middleware to companies in the banking  insurance  retail and telecommunications industries 
in  ibm acquired webify  a 
table of contents provider of middleware to companies primarily in the insurance industry 
in  ibm acquired palisades  a provider of lending software to companies in the mortgage industry and sap has made an offer to purchase business objects 
while we do not believe that either dwl  webify  or palisades had been a direct competitor of chordiant in the past  ibm s acquisition of dwl  webify  and palisades may indicate that ibm will become a competitor of ours in the future 
while the company currently has a good relationship with ibm  this relationship and the company s strategic relationship agreement with ibm may be harmed if the company increasingly finds itself competing with ibm 
our relationships with systems integrators and their willingness to recommend our products to their customers could be harmed if the company were to be subject to a take over attempt from a competitor of such systems integrators 
if systems integrators fail to properly implement our software  our business  reputation and financial results may be harmed 
we are increasingly relying on systems integrators to implement our products  and this trend may continue 
as a result  we have less quality control over the implementation of our software with respect to these transactions and are more reliant on the ability of our systems integrators to correctly implement our software 
if these systems integrators fail to properly implement our software  our business  reputation and financial results may be harmed 
our primary products have a long sales and implementation cycle  which makes it difficult to predict our quarterly results and may cause our operating results to vary significantly 
the period between initial contact with a prospective customer and the implementation of our products is unpredictable and often lengthy  ranging from approximately three to twenty four months 
thus  revenue and cash receipts could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
any delays in the implementation of our products could cause reductions in our revenues 
the licensing of our products is often an enterprise wide decision that generally requires us to provide a significant level of education to prospective customers about the use and benefits of our products 
the implementation of our products involves significant commitment of technical and financial resources and is commonly associated with substantial implementation efforts that may be performed by us  by the customer or by third party systems integrators 
if we underestimate the resources required to meet the expectations we have set with a customer when we set prices  then the timing of revenue could be impacted 
if this happens with a large customer engagement  then this could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
customers generally consider a wide range of issues before committing to purchase our products  including product benefits  ability to operate with existing and future computer systems  vendor financial stability and longevity  ability to accommodate increased transaction volume and product reliability 
if we do not maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting  investors could lose confidence in our financial reporting and customers may delay purchasing decisions  which would harm our business and the market price of our common stock 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports  our business could be harmed 
we are a complex company with complex accounting issues and thus subject to related risks of errors in financial reporting which may cause problems in corporate governance  the costs of which may outweigh the costs of the underlying errors themselves 
for example  the audit committee of the company s board of directors  with the assistance of outside legal counsel  conducted a review of our stock option practices covering the time from the company s initial public offering in through september the audit committee reached a conclusion that incorrect measurement dates were used for financial accounting purposes for stock option grants in certain prior periods 
as a result  the company has recorded additional non cash stock based compensation expense  and related tax effects  related to stock option grants and concluded that a material weakness surrounding the control activities relating to the stock option grants existed at september  to correct these accounting errors  we restated the consolidated financial statements contained in our annual report on form k for the year ended september  and our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended june  as a result of this need to restate financial statements  management and the audit committee determined that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting existed as of september  these material weaknesses have contributed to increased expenses and efforts required for our financial reporting 
if we are not successful in implementing effective internal controls over financial reporting  customers may delay purchasing decisions or we may lose customers  create investor uncertainty  face litigation and the market price of our common stock may decline

controls and procedures in the annual report on form k 

table of contents if we are not able to successfully manage our partner operations in india  our operations and financial results may be adversely affected 
in fiscal year  we entered into an agreement with ness technologies inc  ness usa inc 
formerly ness global services  inc 
and ness technologies india  ltd 
collectively  ness  an independent contracting company with global technical resources and an operations center in bangalore  india and operations in other locations 
the agreement provides for ness  at our direction  to attract  train  assimilate and retain sufficient highly qualified personnel to perform staffing for consulting projects  technical support  product test and certain sustaining engineering functions 
as of september   we use the services of approximately consultants through ness 
in addition  as a result of the reduction in our workforce that took place in july  and the reduction in our workforce that took place in october  by approximately in each instance  we are now more dependent on ness 
the expansion of this agreement is an important component of our strategy to address the business needs of our customers and manage our expenses 
the success of this operation will depend on our ability and ness s ability to attract  train  assimilate and retain highly qualified personnel in the required periods 
a disruption of our relationship with ness could adversely affect our operations 
failure to effectively manage the organization and operations will harm our business and financial results 
if our products do not operate effectively in a company wide environment  we may lose sales and suffer decreased revenues 
if existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or choose not to fully deploy our products  it could damage our reputation and reduce revenues 
our success requires that our products be highly scalable  and able to accommodate substantial increases in the number of users 
our products are expected to be deployed on a variety of computer software and hardware platforms and to be used in connection with a number of third party software applications by personnel who may not have previously used application software systems or our products 
these deployments present very significant technical challenges  which are difficult or impossible to predict 
if these deployments do not succeed  we may lose future sales opportunities and suffer decreased revenues 
if we underestimate the resources required to meet the expectations we have set with a customer when we set prices  then the timing of revenue could be impacted 
if this happens with a large customer engagement then this could have a material adverse effect on our financial results 
defects in our products could diminish demand for our products and result in decreased revenues  decreased market acceptance and injury to our reputation 
errors may be found from time to time in our new  acquired or enhanced products 
any significant software errors in our products may result in decreased revenues  decreased sales  and injury to our reputation and or increased warranty and repair costs 
although we conduct extensive product testing during product development  we have in the past discovered software errors in our products as well as in third party products  and as a result have experienced delays in the shipment of our new products 
because competition for qualified personnel is intense  we may not be able to retain or recruit personnel  which could impact the development and sales of our products 
if we are unable to hire or retain qualified personnel  or if newly hired personnel fail to develop the necessary skills or fail to reach expected levels of productivity  our ability to develop and market our products will be weakened 
our success depends largely on the continued contributions of our key management  finance  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel 
in particular in prior years  we have had significant turnover of our executives as well in our sales  marketing and finance organizations and many key positions are held by people who have less than two years of experience in their roles with one company 
if these people are not well suited to their new roles  then this could result in the company having problems in executing its strategy or in reporting its financial results 
because of the dependency on a small number of large deals  we are uniquely dependent upon the talents and relationships of a few executives and have no guarantee of their retention 
changes in key sales management could affect our ability to maintain existing customer relationships or to close pending transactions 
we have been targeted by recruitment agencies seeking to hire our key management  finance  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel 
in addition  in july and again in october of  we reduced the size of our workforce by approximately in each instance  which may have a negative effect on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel 
to date  our sales have been concentrated in the banking  insurance  healthcare  and telecommunications markets  and if we are unable to continue sales in these markets or successfully penetrate new markets  or if these industries reduce their spending in reaction to the difficulties in the subprime lending market  our revenues may decline 
sales of our products and services in five large markets banking  insurance  healthcare  telecommunications and retail markets accounted for approximately and of our total revenues for the year ended september  and  respectively 
we expect that revenues from these five markets will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
if we are unable to successfully increase penetration of our existing markets or achieve sales 
table of contents in additional markets  or if the overall economic climate of our target markets deteriorates  our revenues may decline 
some of our current or prospective customers  especially those in the banking and insurance industries are in businesses that have or could have exposure  directly or indirectly  to the residential mortgage sector or homebuilder sector which has recently been facing financial difficulties 
if this causes our current or prospective customers to reduce their spending on technology  then this could have an adverse impact on our sales and revenues low gross margin in services revenues could adversely impact our overall gross margin and operating results 
our services revenues have had lower gross margins than our license revenues 
service revenues comprised and of our total revenues for the year ended september  and  respectively 
gross margin on service revenues was and for the year ended september  and  respectively 
license revenues comprised and of our total revenues for the years ended september  and  respectively 
gross margins on license revenues were and for the years ended september  and  respectively 
as a result  an increase in the percentage of total revenues represented by services revenues  or an unexpected decrease in license revenues  could have a detrimental impact on our overall gross margins 
an increase to services revenues would require us to expand our services organization  successfully recruit and train a sufficient number of qualified services personnel  enter into new implementation projects and obtain renewals of current maintenance contracts by our customers 
such an expansion could further reduce gross margins in our services revenues 
we may not have the workforce necessary to support our platform of products if demand for our products substantially increased  and  if we need to rebuild our workforce in the future  we may not be able to recruit personnel in a timely manner  which could adversely impact the development and sales of our products which would directly impact our operating results 
in july and again in october of  we reduced the size of our workforce by approximately in each instance 
in the event that demand for our products increases  we may need to rebuild our workforce or increase outsourced functions to companies based in foreign jurisdictions and we may be unable to hire  train or retain qualified personnel in a timely manner  which may weaken our ability to market our products in a timely manner  adversely impacting our operations 
our success depends largely on ensuring that we have adequate personnel to support our platform of products as well as the continued contributions of our key management  finance  engineering  sales and marketing and professional services personnel 
if we fail to introduce new versions and releases of functional and scalable products in a timely manner  customers may license competing products and our revenues may decline 
if we are unable to ship or implement enhancements to our products when planned  or fail to achieve timely market acceptance of these enhancements  we may suffer lost sales and could fail to achieve anticipated revenues 
we have in the past  and expect in the future  to derive a significant portion of our total revenues from the license of our primary product suite 
our future operating results will depend on the demand for the product suite by future customers  including new and enhanced releases that are subsequently introduced 
if our competitors release new products that are superior to our products in performance or price  or if we fail to enhance our products or introduce new features and functionality in a timely manner  demand for our products may decline and we may not be able to recover our r d expenditures from such products 
we have in the past experienced delays in the planned release dates of new versions of our software products and upgrades 
new versions of our products may not be released on schedule or may contain defects when released 
we depend on technology licensed to us by third parties  and the loss or inability to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay sales of our products 
we license from several software providers technologies that are incorporated into our products 
we anticipate that we will continue to license technology from third parties in the future 
this software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
while currently we are not materially dependent on any single third party for such licenses  the loss of the technology licenses could result in delays in the license of our products until equivalent technology is developed or identified  licensed and integrated into our products 
even if substitute technologies are available  there can be no guarantee that we will be able to license these technologies on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
defects in third party products associated with our products could impair our products functionality and injure our reputation 
the effective implementation of our products depends upon the successful operation of third party products in conjunction with our products 
any undetected defects in these third party products could prevent the implementation or impair the 
table of contents functionality of our products  delay new product introductions or injure our reputation 
in the past  while our business has not been materially harmed  product releases have been delayed as a result of errors in third party software and we have incurred significant expenses fixing and investigating the cause of these errors 
our customers and systems integration partners may have the ability to alter our source code and resulting inappropriate alterations could adversely affect the performance of our products  cause injury to our reputation and increase operating expenses 
customers and systems integration partners may have access to the computer source code for certain elements of our products and may alter the source code 
alteration of our source code may lead to implementation  operation  technical support and upgrade problems for our customers 
this could adversely affect the market acceptance of our products  and any necessary investigative work and repairs could cause us to incur significant expenses and delays in implementation 
if our products do not operate with the hardware and software platforms used by our customers  our customers may license competing products and our revenues will decline 
if our products fail to satisfy advancing technological requirements of our customers and potential customers  the market acceptance of these products could be reduced 
we currently serve a customer base with a wide variety of constantly changing hardware  software applications and networking platforms 
customer acceptance of our products depends on many factors such as our ability to integrate our products with multiple platforms and existing or legacy systems  and  our ability to anticipate and support new standards  especially internet and enterprise java standards 
a failure in our initial attempt to deploy our software through a software as a service saas model could cause injury to our reputation and impair our ability to develop  market and sell our products under a saas model 
we recently entered into a license with a third party that will allow that third party to develop and host in their data centers  applications based on our software to provide services to their customers  most of whom are in markets that we do not currently penetrate 
as we have no previous experience in deploying our software in a saas model  a failure of this effort could have a detrimental effect to our ability to attract other third parties to use our software in their saas businesses 
our failure to successfully integrate with future acquired or merged companies and technologies could prevent us from operating efficiently 
our business strategy includes pursuing opportunities to grow our business  both through internal growth and through merger  acquisition and technology and other asset transactions 
to implement this strategy  we may be involved in merger and acquisition activity and additional technology and asset purchase transactions 
merger and acquisition transactions are motivated by many factors  including  among others  our desire to grow our business  acquire skilled personnel  obtain new technologies and expand and enhance our product offerings 
growth through mergers and acquisitions has several identifiable risks  including difficulties associated with successfully integrating distinct businesses into new organizations  the substantial management time devoted to integrating personnel  technology and entire companies  the possibility that we might not be successful in retaining the employees  undisclosed liabilities  the failure to realize anticipated benefits such as cost savings and synergies and issues related to integrating acquired technology  merged acquired companies or content into our products such as unanticipated expenses 
realization of any of these risks in connection with any technology transaction or asset purchase we have entered into  or may enter into  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  cash balances  and financial condition 
if we become subject to intellectual property infringement claims  including patent infringement claims  these claims could be costly and time consuming to defend  divert management s attention  cause product delays and have an adverse effect on our revenues and net income 
we expect that software product developers and providers of software in markets similar to our target markets will increasingly be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products overlap 
any claims  with or without merit  could be costly and time consuming to defend  divert our management s attention or cause product delays 
if any of our products were found to infringe a third party s proprietary rights  we could be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements to be able to sell our products 
royalty and licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
in particular  if we were sued for patent infringement by a patent holding company  one which has acquired large numbers of patents solely for the purpose of bringing suit against alleged infringers rather than practicing the patents  it may be costly to 
table of contents defend such a suit 
we have received a letter from one such patent holding company alleging that our products may infringe one or more of their patents 
if any of our products were found to infringe such patent  the patent holder could seek an injunction to enjoin our use of the infringing product 
if we were not able to remove or replace the infringing portions of software with non infringing software  and were no longer able to license some or all of our software products  such an injunction would have an extremely detrimental effect on our business 
if we were required to settle such claim  it could be extremely costly 
a patent infringement claim could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the application of percentage of completion and completed contract accounting to our business is complex and may result in delays in the reporting of our financial results and revenue not being recognized as we expect 
although we attempt to use standardized license agreements designed to meet current revenue recognition criteria under generally accepted accounting principles  we must often negotiate and revise terms and conditions of these standardized agreements  particularly in multi product transactions 
at the time of entering into a transaction  we assess whether any services included within the arrangement require us to perform significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products 
for contracts involving significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products  we recognize the license and professional consulting services revenues using the percentage of completion method using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress towards completion 
the application of the percentage of completion method of accounting is complex and involves judgments and estimates  which may change significantly based on customer requirements 
this complexity combined with changing customer requirements could result in delays in the proper determination of our percentage of completion estimates and revenue not being recognized as we expect 
we have also entered into co development projects with our customers to jointly develop new vertical applications  often over the course of a year or longer 
in such cases we may only be able to recognize revenue upon delivery of the new application 
the accounting treatment for these co development projects could result in delays in the recognition of revenue 
the failure to successfully complete these projects to the satisfaction of the customer could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
changes in our revenue recognition model could result in short term declines to revenue 
historically  a high percentage of license revenues have been accounted for on the percentage of completion method of accounting or recognized as revenue upon the delivery of product 
if we were to enter into new types of transactions accounted for on a subscription or term basis  revenues might be recognized over a longer period of time 
the impact of this change would make revenue recognition more predictable over the long term  but it might also result in a short term reduction of revenue as the new transactions took effect 
we may identify material weaknesses relating to internal control over financial reporting in the future  which may result in additional expenses and diversion of management s time as a result of performing future system and process evaluation  testing and remediation required to comply with future management assessment and auditor attestation requirements 
in connection with the company s compliance with section under sox for the fiscal years ended september  and  we identified certain material weaknesses 
in future periods  we will continue to document our internal controls to allow management to report on  and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to  our internal control  over financial reporting as required by section of sox  within the time frame required by section in the future  we may incur additional expenses and diversion of management s time as a result of performing the system and process evaluation  testing and remediation required to comply with management s assessment and auditor attestation requirements 
if we are not able to timely comply with the requirements set forth in section in future periods  we might be subject to sanctions or investigation by the regulatory authorities 
any such action could adversely affect our business or financial results

item legal proceedings beginning in july  the company and certain of our officers and directors  or individuals  were named as defendants in a series of class action stockholder complaints filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  now consolidated under the caption  in re chordiant software  inc initial public offering securities litigation  case no 
cv 
in the amended complaint  filed in april  the plaintiffs allege that the company  the individuals  and the underwriters of our initial public offering  or ipo  violated section of the securities act of and section b of the exchange act of based on allegations that our registration statement and prospectus failed to disclose material facts regarding the compensation to be received by  and the stock allocation practices of  our ipo underwriters 
the complaint also contains claims against the individuals for control person liability under securities act section and exchange act section the plaintiffs seek unspecified monetary damages and other relief 
similar complaints were filed in the same court against hundreds of other public companies  or issuers  that conducted ipo s of their common stock in the late s or in the year collectively  the ipo lawsuits 
in august  all of the ipo lawsuits were consolidated for pretrial purposes before united states judge shira scheindlin of the southern district of new york 
in july  the company joined in a global motion to dismiss the ipo lawsuits filed by all of the issuers among others 
in october  the court entered an order dismissing the individuals from the ipo lawsuits without prejudice  pursuant to an agreement tolling the statute of limitations with respect to the individuals 
in february  the court issued a decision denying the motion to dismiss against chordiant and many of the other issuers 
in june  issuers and plaintiffs reached a tentative settlement agreement that would  among other things  result in the dismissal with prejudice of all claims against the issuers and individuals in the ipo lawsuits  and the assignment to plaintiffs of certain potential claims that the issuers may have against the underwriters 
the tentative settlement also provides that  in the event that plaintiffs ultimately recover less than a guaranteed sum of billion from the ipo underwriters  plaintiffs would be entitled to payment by each participating issuer s insurer of a pro rata share of any shortfall in the plaintiffs guaranteed recovery 
in september  in connection with the possible settlement  those individuals who had entered tolling agreements with plaintiffs described above agreed to extend those agreements so that they would not expire prior to any settlement being finalized 
in june  chordiant and almost all of the other issuers entered into a formal settlement agreement with the plaintiffs 
on february   the court issued a decision certifying a class action for settlement purposes  and granting preliminary approval of the settlement subject to modification of certain bar orders contemplated by the settlement 
on august   the court reaffirmed class certification and preliminary approval of the modified settlement in a comprehensive order  and directed that notice of the settlement be published and mailed to class members beginning november  on february   the court dismissed litigation filed against certain underwriters in connection with the claims to be assigned to the plaintiffs under the settlement 
on april   the court held a final fairness hearing to determine whether to grant final approval of the settlement 
on december   the second circuit court of appeals vacated the lower court s earlier decision certifying as class actions the six ipo lawsuits designated as focus cases 
thereafter  the district court ordered a stay of all proceedings in all of the ipo lawsuits pending the outcome of plaintiffs petition to the second circuit for rehearing en banc and resolution of the class certification issue 
on april   the second circuit denied plaintiffs rehearing petition  holding that the actions could not be maintained as pled but clarifying that the plaintiffs may seek to certify a more limited class in the district court 
accordingly  the settlement as originally negotiated will not be finally approved 
plaintiffs had until july  in which to file amended complaints against all issuers  including chordiant 
plaintiffs filed amended complaints in the six focus cases on or about august  in september  the company s named officers and directors again extended the tolling agreement with plaintiffs 
on or about september   plaintiffs moved to certify the classes alleged in the focus cases and to appoint class representatives and class counsel in those cases 
on or about november   issuers in the focus cases filed a motion to dismiss the claims alleged against them in the amended complaints

c jw nd nd both complaints were brought purportedly on behalf of the company against certain current and former officers and directors 
on november   the court entered an order consolidating these actions and requiring the plaintiffs to file a consolidated complaint

on may   the company filed a motion to dismiss the entire action on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to take the steps necessary to bring a derivative action 
the individual defendants filed motions to dismiss as well 
the parties have agreed that the plaintiffs opposition to the motions to dismiss would not be due until october   in order to permit the parties an opportunity to explore a resolution of this dispute

in september  the company received a letter from acacia technologies group  a patent holding company  suggesting that the company may be infringing on two patents  designated by united states patent numbers  and  which are held by one of their patent licensing and enforcement subsidiaries 
the company is currently reviewing the validity of these patents and whether the company s products may infringe upon them 
the company has not formed a view of whether the company may have liability for infringement of these patents 
any related claims  whether or not they have merit  could be costly and time consuming to defend  divert our management s attention or cause product delays 
if any of our products were found to infringe such patents  the patent holder could seek an injunction to enjoin our use of the infringing product

executive overview as an enterprise software vendor  we generate substantially all of our revenues from the banking  insurance  healthcare  telecommunications  and retail industries 
our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services out of their lines of business and information technology budgets 
as a result  our revenues are heavily influenced by our customers long term business outlook and willingness to invest in new enterprise information systems and business applications 
in fiscal year  we recorded revenue of million 
in fiscal year  we generated million of net income and ended the fiscal year with over million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities as compared to million for the year ended september total revenue for the year ended september  increased to million from million of the prior year 
the growth in revenue was evenly distributed between license and service revenue  each increasing by million 
the increase in license revenue was primarily driven by an increase in the transaction size of license transactions in excess of million as compared to the prior year 
the increase in service revenue was primarily composed of an increase in consulting revenue of million  an increase in support and maintenance revenue of million and an increase of million in expense reimbursement revenue offset by a decrease in training revenue of million 
in the past an increase in license revenue has resulted in a related increase in consulting revenue as our customers request us to assist with their implementation efforts 
the increase in support and maintenance revenue is expected to continue if we are able to add new licenses to our existing base of licenses at a rate greater than customers opting not to renew their annual support and maintenance contracts 
software industry consolidation and possible increased competition the software industry in general is continuing to undergo a period of consolidation  and there has been recent consolidation in sectors of the software industry in which we operate 
within the year oracle announced the acquisitions of agile software  an enterprise solutions software maker and hyperion software  a business performance software maker 
also in  ibm acquired palisades  a provider of lending software to companies in the mortgage industry and sap has made an offer to purchase business objects 
in  ibm acquired webify  a provider of middleware to companies primarily in the insurance industry 
in january  oracle acquired siebel systems  inc  a maker of customer relationship management software products and acquired portal software  a provider of billing and revenue management solutions for the communications and media industry 
siebel systems  inc was a competitor of ours 
in september  ibm had acquired dwl  a provider of middleware to companies in the banking  insurance  retail and telecommunications industries 
in  oracle acquired i flex solutions  ltd  a banking software maker headquartered in mumbai  india 
while we do not believe that agile software  hyperion software  palisades  webify  portal software  dwl  or i flex solutions have been significant competitors of chordiant in the past  the acquisition of these companies by oracle and ibm may indicate that we will face increased competition from larger and more established entities in the future 

table of contents financial trends backlog 
an increasingly material portion of our revenues have been derived from large customer transactions 
for some of these transactions  the associated professional services provided to the customer can span over a period greater than one year 
if the services delivery period is over a prolonged period of time  it will cause the associated backlog to be recognized as revenue over a similar period of time 
as of september  and  we had approximately million and million in backlog  respectively  which we define as contractual commitments by our customers through purchase orders or contracts 
this increase in backlog is partially reflected in the growth of deferred revenue recorded on our balance sheet 
for the period ended september  to september  deferred revenue increased million due to an increase of million in short term deferred revenue and a million increase in long term deferred revenue 
the increase in long term deferred revenue was primarily driven by entering into multi year support and maintenance contracts with our customers 
backlog is comprised of software license orders for which the delivered products have not been accepted by customers or have not otherwise met all of the required criteria for revenue recognition 
this component includes billed amounts classified as deferred revenue  deferred revenue from customer support contracts  consulting service orders representing the unbilled remaining balances of consulting contracts not yet completed or delivered  plus deferred consulting revenue where we have not otherwise met all of the required criteria for revenue recognition 
backlog is not necessarily indicative of revenues to be recognized in a specified future period 
there are many factors that would impact chordiant s conversion of backlog as recognizable revenue  such as chordiant s progress in completing projects for its customers  chordiant s customers meeting anticipated schedules for customer dependent deliverables and customers increasing the scope or duration of a contract causing license revenue to be deferred for a longer period of time 
chordiant provides no assurances that any portion of its backlog will be recognized as revenue during any fiscal year or at all  or that its backlog will be recognized as revenues in any given period 
in addition  it is possible that customers from whom we expect to derive revenue from backlog will default  and as a result  we may not be able to recognize expected revenue from backlog 
for the year ended september   we entered into several large customer orders resulting in a significant portion of our near term license revenues being recognized under the percentage of completion method of accounting such that our deferred revenue balance increased 
these orders will require consulting services that are essential to the functionality of the respective licenses 
implementation by third parties 
over time  as our products mature and system integrators become more familiar with our products  our involvement with implementations has diminished on some projects 
if this trend continues to evolve  certain agreements with customers may transition from a contract accounting model sop to a more traditional revenue model whereby revenues are recorded upon delivery 
service revenues 
service revenues as a percentage of total revenues were   and for the years ended september    and  respectively 
we expect that service revenues will represent between and of our total revenues in the foreseeable future 
revenues from international customers versus north america 
for all periods presented  revenues were principally derived from customer accounts in north america and europe 
for the years ended september    and  international revenues were million  million  and million or approximately   and of our total revenues  respectively 
we believe international revenues will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues in future periods 
the significant increase in international revenue for year ended september   as compared to the prior fiscal year was due to an improved economy for the region as well as an improved sales production for the region resulting from the new management team that was put in place over the past several quarters 
international revenues were favorably impacted for the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september   as both the british pound and the euro increased in average value by approximately and  respectively  as compared to the us dollar 
international revenues were negatively impacted for the year ended september   as compared to the year ended september   as both the british pound and the euro decreased in average value by less than and approximately  respectively  as compared to the us dollar 
for the years ended september    and  north america revenues were million  million  and million or approximately   and of our total revenues  respectively 
as the us economy has remained 
table of contents strong  we have seen an increase in north america revenues 
large customers have become more willing to invest in new enterprise infrastructure projects 
we believe north america revenues will continue to represent to of our total revenues in the future 
gross margins 
management focuses on license and service gross margin in evaluating our financial condition and operating performance 
gross margins on license revenues were   and for the years ended september    and  respectively 
the changes in gross margins are primarily related to the amortization expense associated with capitalized software development costs pertaining to a banking product 
we expect license gross margin on current products to range from to in the foreseeable future 
the margin will fluctuate with the mix of products sold 
historically  the enterprise solution products have higher associated third party royalty expense than the marketing solution products and decision management products 
gross margins on service revenues were   and for the years ended september    and  respectively 
the increase in gross margins for the year ended september  is primarily due to improved consulting services utilization rates and increased support and maintenance revenue 
we expect that gross margins on service revenue to range between and in the foreseeable future 
margins can be negatively impacted during  and immediately following  periods in which professional service department headcounts increase  as resources are not immediately billable 
acquisition of kiq limited 
on december   we acquired kiq limited  a privately held united kingdom software company with branch offices in the netherlands  or kiq  specializing in the development and sales of decision management systems 
the year ended september  includes the revenue and expense of kiq from the acquisition date  december   through the end of the fiscal year  september  the years ended september  and include the revenues and expenses of kiq for the entire fiscal year 
costs related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of significant professional service expenses are included in general and administrative costs relating to efforts to comply with the sarbanes oxley act of for the years ended september    and  these costs were million  million  and million  respectively 
while these costs are expected to continue into the next fiscal year  the decline in amount and timing of the costs through fiscal year is uncertain as compared to the costs incurred for the year ended september  costs related to stock option investigation 
significant outside professional services are included in general and administrative costs associated with the company s stock option investigation which began in july and was completed during the quarter ended march  this issue is more fully described in the in note  restatement of previously issued consolidated financial statements in notes to consolidated financial statements of the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  for the year ended september  and  these costs were and million  respectively 
we have not incurred any additional costs since the quarter ended march  and do not expect to incur such costs in future periods 
cost to amend eligible options 
in july  our board of directors the board initiated a review of our historical stock option grant practices and appointed the audit committee to oversee the investigation 
the audit committee determined that the correct measurement dates for a number of stock option grants made by us during the period to  or review period  differ from the measurement dates previously used to account for such option grants 
the audit committee identified errors related to the determination of the measurement dates for grants of options where the price of our common stock on the selected grant date was lower than the price on the actual grant date which would permit recipients to exercise these options at a lower exercise price 
as such  these affected stock options are deemed  for accounting purposes  to have been granted at a discount 
based on the determination made for accounting purposes  the discounted options for accounting purposes may now be deemed to have been granted at a discount for tax purposes  which may expose the holders of these impacted stock option grants to potentially adverse tax treatment under section a of the internal revenue code and state law equivalents 
as more fully described on form sc to i filed with the sec on march   chordiant offered certain optionees the opportunity to increase the exercise price of the discounted options to limit the potential adverse personal tax consequences that may apply to those stock options under section a of the internal revenue code and state law equivalents 
on april   eligible optionees finalized their elections under the offer and were awarded a future cash payment equal to the price differential of the amended options 
these payments will be treated as bonus payments 
these cash payments will be approximately million and will be paid out in january the cost of these bonus payments were fully accrued as of september  reduction in workforce 
in october  the company initiated a restructuring plan intended to align its resources and cost structure with expected future revenues 
the restructuring plan included a balancing of services resources worldwide  an elimination of duplicative functions internationally  and a shift in the us field organization toward a focus on domain based sales and pre sales teams 

table of contents the restructuring plan included an immediate reduction in positions of slightly more than ten percent of the company s workforce  consolidation of our european facilities  and the closure of our france office 
a majority of the positions eliminated were in europe 
the plan was committed to on october   and we began notifying employees on october  we recorded a pre tax cash restructuring expense of million as calculated using the net present value of the related costs as required by sfas the expense was composed of million for severance costs and million for exiting excess facilities of which million of the excess facility expense is associated with non cash expenses for the write off of leasehold improvements and the reversal of a favorable purchase price adjustment related to the france office lease 
we anticipated that million of the expense would result in cash expenditures 
as of september   we have paid million in cash payments and expect to pay the remaining million during the first six months of fiscal year in november  we expect to negotiate a break clause in the lease allowing for an early termination of the united kingdom facility which will release us of any future rent liabilities subsequent to january as of september   we expect the current accrued restructuring balance to be sufficient in amount to cover all future rental and lease termination payments  therefore  we do not anticipate any incremental restructuring expenses to terminate this lease early 
all obligations related to severance and benefits have been paid as of september  in july  we undertook an approximate reduction in our workforce 
in connection with this action  we incurred a one time cash expense of approximately million in the fourth quarter ended september  for severance benefits 
as of september   million of the cash charges remains outstanding 
during fiscal year  we restructured several areas of the company to reduce expenses and improve revenues 
as part of this restructuring  we closed an office facility in boston  massachusetts and recorded an expense associated with the long term lease which expires in january during the three months ended march   we completed a new sublease with a sub lessee for the remaining term of our lease at a rate lower than that which was forecasted when the original restructuring expense was recorded in this change in estimate resulted in a million restructuring expense for the year ended september  past results may not be indicative of future performance 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our prospects must be considered given the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in new and rapidly evolving businesses 
there can be no assurance we will be successful in addressing these risks and difficulties 
moreover  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates  including those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of stock based compensation  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of deferred tax assets  restructuring expenses  contingencies  vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value in multiple element arrangements and the estimates associated with the percentage of completion method of accounting for certain of our revenue contracts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  including estimating the total estimated time required to complete sales arrangements involving significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the allowance for doubtful accounts  and assessment of the probability of the outcome of our current litigation  stock based compensation expense  accounting for income taxes

revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from licenses of our software and related services  which include assistance in implementation  customization and integration  post contract customer support  training and consulting 
the amount and timing of our revenue is difficult to predict and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in operating losses 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretation of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant estimates based on judgment 
software license revenue is recognized in accordance with statement of position no 
software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position no 
software revenue recognition with respect to certain arrangements  or collectively sop for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue for services and post contract customer support based upon the fair value vsoe of the respective elements 
the fair value vsoe of the services element is based upon the standard hourly rates we charge for the services when such services are sold separately 
the fair value vsoe for annual post contract customer support is generally established with the contractual future renewal rates included in the contracts  when the renewal rate is substantive and consistent with the fees when support services are sold separately 
when contracts contain multiple elements and fair value vsoe exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements  principally the license portion  based upon the residual method as prescribed by sop in multiple element transactions where vsoe is not established for an undelivered element  we recognize revenue upon the establishment of vsoe for that element or when the element is delivered 
at the time we enter into a transaction  we assess whether any services included within the arrangement related to significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products 
for contracts for products that do not involve significant implementation or customization essential to the product functionality  we recognize license revenues when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is probable and delivery has occurred as prescribed by sop for contracts that involve significant implementation or customization essential to the functionality of our products  we recognize the license and professional consulting services revenue using either the percentage of completion method or the completed contract method as prescribed by statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain product type contracts  or sop the percentage of completion method is applied when we have the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the total effort required for completion using labor hours incurred as the measure of progress towards completion 
the progress toward completion is measured based on the go live date 
we define the go live date as the date the essential product functionality has been delivered or the application enters into a production environment or the point at which no significant additional chordiant supplied professional service resources are required 
estimates are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
we account for the changes as changes in accounting estimates when the information becomes known 
information impacting estimates obtained after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of the financial statements is used to update the estimates 
provisions for estimated contract losses  if any  are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
when we sell additional licenses related to the original licensing agreement  revenue is recognized upon delivery if the project has reached the go live date  or if the project has not reached the go live date  revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method 
we classify revenues from these arrangements as license and service revenue based upon the estimated fair value of each element using the residual method 
the completed contract method is applied when we are unable to obtain reasonably dependable estimates of the total effort required for completion 
under the completed contract method  all revenue and related costs of revenue are deferred and recognized upon completion 
for product co development arrangements relating to software products in development prior to the consummation of the individual arrangements where we retain the intellectual property being developed and intend to sell the resulting products to other customers  license revenue is deferred until the delivery of the final product  provided all other requirements of sop are met 
expenses associated with these co development arrangements are accounted for under sfas and are normally expensed as incurred as they are considered to be research and development costs that do not qualify for capitalization or deferral

revenue from subscription or term license agreements  which include software  but exclude rights to unspecified future products and maintenance  is recognized upon delivery of the software if all conditions of recognizing revenue have been met including that the related agreement is non cancelable  non refundable and provided on an unsupported basis 
we recognize revenue for post contract customer support ratably over the support period which ranges from one to five years 
our training and consulting services revenues are recognized as such services are performed on an hourly or daily basis for time and material contracts 
for consulting services arrangements with a fixed fee  we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion method 
for all sales we use either a signed license agreement or a binding purchase order where we have a master license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our third party systems integrators are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders or order forms on a transaction by transaction basis 
revenues from reseller arrangements are recognized on the sell through method  when the reseller reports to us the sale of our software products to end users

if we determine that the collection of a fee is not probable  we recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
if a transaction includes extended payment terms  we recognized revenue as the payments become due and payable 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze accounts receivable and analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
generally  we require no collateral from our customers 
our gross accounts receivable balance was million including long term accounts receivable of million with an allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of september  our gross accounts receivable balance was million with an allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of september  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
to date  bad debts have not been material and have been within management s expectations 
stock based compensation expense 
upon adoption of sfas r on october   we began estimating the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the value of each employee stock option was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes model for the purpose of the pro forma financial disclosure in accordance with sfas the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
with the adoption of sfas r on october   we used the trinomial lattice valuation technique to determine the assumptions used in the black scholes model 
the trinomial lattice valuation technique was used to provide better estimates of fair values and meet the fair value objectives of sfas r 
the expected term of options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercises and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
the estimated value of a stock option is most sensitive to the volatility assumption 
based on the september  variables  it is estimated that a change of in either the volatility  expected life or interest rate assumption would result in a corresponding  or change in the estimated value of the option being valued using the black scholes model 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax 
table of contents exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to of the deferred tax assets as of september   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our net deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and research and development tax credits 
deferred tax assets have been fully reserved for in all periods presented 
we were profitable for the quarters ended march   june   and september  and if we continue to be profitable in the near term  we will need to re evaluate the valuation allowance 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
furthermore  we assess the impairment of goodwill annually 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  market capitalization declines relative to net book value  and a current expectation that  more likely than not  a long lived asset will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
when one or more of the above indicators of impairment occurs we estimate the value of long lived assets and intangible assets to determine whether there is impairment 
we measure any impairment based on the projected discounted cash flow method  which requires us to make several estimates including the estimated cash flows associated with the asset  the period over which these cash flows will be generated and a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
these estimates are subjective and if we made different estimates  it could materially impact the estimated fair value of these assets and the conclusions we reached regarding impairment 
to date  we have not identified any triggering events noted above 
we are required to perform an impairment review of our goodwill balance on at least an annual basis 
this impairment review involves a two step process as follows step we compare the fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value  including goodwill  of each of those units 
for each reporting unit where the carrying value  including goodwill  exceeds the unit s fair value  we proceed on to step if a unit s fair value exceeds the carrying value  no further work is performed and no impairment charge is necessary 
step we perform an allocation of the fair value of the reporting unit to our identifiable tangible and non goodwill intangible assets and liabilities 
this derives an implied fair value for the reporting unit s goodwill 
we then compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than the implied fair value of its goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess 
we determined that we have one reporting unit 
we completed a goodwill impairment review for the period including september  and and performed step of the goodwill impairment analysis required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and concluded that goodwill was not impaired as of september  and using the methodology described above 
accordingly  step was not performed 
we will continue to test for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amount 

table of contents restructuring expenses 
in the past five years  we have implemented cost reduction plans as part of our continued effort to streamline our operations to reduce ongoing operating expenses 
these plans resulted in restructuring expenses related to  among others  the consolidation of excess facilities 
these charges relate to facilities and portions of facilities we no longer utilize and either seek to terminate early or sublease 
lease termination costs and brokerage fees for the abandoned facilities were estimated for the remaining lease obligations and were offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to locate and contract with suitable sub lessees and sublease rates which can be achieved using market trend information analyses provided by a commercial real estate brokerage retained by us 
each reporting period we review these estimates and to the extent that these assumptions change due to new agreements with landlords  new subleases with tenants  or changes in the market  the ultimate restructuring expenses for these abandoned facilities could vary by material amounts 
determining functional currencies for the purpose of consolidation 
we have several foreign subsidiaries that together account for a significant portion of our revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of the foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under the relevant accounting guidance are either included within the consolidated statement of operations or as a separate part of the consolidated statements of stockholders equity and comprehensive income loss under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
under the relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses is dependent upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on management s judgment and involves consideration of all relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary conducts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures would be considered the functional currency but any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations must also be considered 
if any subsidiary s functional currency were deemed to be the local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements would be included in cumulative translation adjustments 
however  if the functional currency were deemed to be the united states dollar then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our consolidated statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be recognized in our consolidated statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses arising after the date of change would be included within our consolidated statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the relevant subsidiary s local currency to be the functional currency for each of our international subsidiaries 
accordingly  foreign currency translation gains and loses are included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income within our balance sheet for all periods presented 
the foreign currency gains or losses are dependent upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business against the united states dollar 
these currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro and the canadian dollar 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly different than those reported in previous periods 
at september   approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents were held by our subsidiaries outside of the united states

the increase or decrease of license revenue occurring within the three different product groups is dependent on the timing of when a sales transaction is completed and whether a license transaction was sold with essential consulting services 
products licensed with essential consulting services are generally recognized as revenue under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
the timing and amount of revenue for those transactions being recognized under the percentage of completion is influenced by the progress of work performed relative to the project length of customer contracts and the dollar value of such contracts 
the following table sets forth our license revenue by product emphasis for the years ended september  and in thousands  except percentages years ended september  change license revenue enterprise solutions marketing solutions decision management solutions total license revenue 
table of contents total license revenue increased million  or  for the year ended september  compared to the same period of the prior year 
a significant portion of this increase is attributable to a single customer that purchased a perpetual product license as part of a million agreement 
the value of this agreement has been allocated as follows million to license fees  million to support and maintenance fees expected to be recognized over the next five year period  and million to consulting fees 
the license amount was recorded as deferred license revenue at the inception of the agreement and is being recognized on a percentage of completion basis due to the essential services required for the functionality of the software 
for the year ended september   million of license revenue has been recognized in connection with this agreement 
in addition to the revenue contribution from the aforementioned customer  the increase in license revenue for the year ended september  was primarily due to the growth in the absolute dollar size of transactions in excess of million as compared to the same period of the prior year 
service revenue 
service revenue is primarily composed of consulting implementation and integration  consulting customization  training  post contract customer support services  or pcs  and certain reimbursable out of pocket expenses 
the increase or decrease of service revenue within the three different product emphases is primarily due to the timing of when license transactions are completed  whether or not the license was sold with essential consulting services  the sophistication of the customer s application  and the expertise of the customer s internal development team 
for other service transactions  service revenue will lag in timing compared to the period of when the license revenue is recognized 
the following table sets forth our service revenue by product emphasis for the years ended september  and in thousands  except percentages years ended september  change service revenue enterprise solutions marketing solutions decision management solutions total license revenue total service revenue increased million or for the year ended september  compared to the same period of the prior year 
the million increase is primarily related to increases of million in pcs revenue  million in consulting revenue  million in reimbursement of out of pocket expense revenue offset by a decrease of million in training revenue 
the increase in pcs revenue is a function of the growth in new license bookings sold with pcs agreements combined with the renewal of existing pcs customers at a rate in excess of existing customers  declining the service in the year of renewal 
the increase in consulting revenue is a direct result of the growth in license revenue as the majority of our customers will use some form of our consulting services in connection with their project 
cost of revenues license 
cost of license revenues includes third party software royalties and amortization of capitalized software development costs 
royalty expenses can vary depending upon the mix of products sold within the period 
the capitalized software development costs pertain to a banking product that was completed and available for general release in august and the third party costs associated with the porting of a product to a new platform 
the porting project was completed in august and the aggregate costs capitalized were million

table of contents years ended september  change cost of service revenue percentage of total revenue cost of service revenue decreased by million or for the year ended september  as compared to the same period of the prior year 
this change is primarily due to a decrease in personnel and related costs of million associated with a decrease in headcount which was offset by an increase in third party consulting costs of million and third party pcs costs of million 
service costs were able to remain constant while service revenue increased due to improved utilization of our internal consultant teams  replacing full time employees with third party consultants converting a fixed cost to a variable cost and increasing pcs revenue  which to a limited degree is not based on a variable cost model  so there is not a direct relationship of revenue to costs 
amortization of intangible assets included in cost of revenues

restructuring expense 
in october  we initiated a restructuring plan that included an immediate reduction in positions of slightly more than ten percent of the company s workforce  consolidation of our european facilities  and the closure of our french office 
a majority of the positions eliminated were in europe 
we recorded a pre tax cash restructuring expense of million as calculated using the net present value of the related costs as required by sfas the expense was composed of million for severance costs and million for exiting excess facilities of which million of the excess facility expense is associated with non cash charges for the write off of leasehold improvements and the reversal of a favorable purchase price adjustment related to the france office lease 
we anticipated that million of the expense would result in cash expenditures 
as of september   we have paid million in cash payments and expect to pay the remaining million during the first six months of fiscal year during fiscal year  we restructured several areas of the company to reduce expenses and improve revenues 
as part of this restructuring  we closed an office facility in boston  massachusetts and recorded an expense associated with the long term lease which expires in january during  we completed a new sublease for this facility with a new sub tenant for the remaining term of our lease at a rate lower than that which was forecasted when the original restructuring expense was recorded in this change in estimate resulted in an additional million in restructuring expenses for the year ended september  stock based compensation included in individual operating expense and cost of revenue categories

if the global economy weakens  a decline could occur 
we anticipate that operating expenses will continue to be a material use of our cash resources 
we may continue to utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in other businesses  technologies or product lines

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes and foreign currency fluctuations 
the following table presents the amounts of restricted cash and marketable securities that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of september  in thousands september  fair value average interest rates restricted cash in short term investments marketable securities total restricted cash and marketable securities the following table presents the amounts of restricted cash that are subject to interest rate risk by year of expected maturity and average interest rates as of september  in thousands september  fair value average interest rates restricted cash in short term investments total restricted cash in short term investments interest rate risk 
our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to money market accounts  commercial paper  short term certificates of deposit and marketable securities 
we invest our excess cash in money market accounts  commercial paper  certificates of deposit  and marketable securities with maturities of less than one year 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell our fixed rate securities which have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
to provide a meaningful assessment of the interest rate risk associated with the company s total restricted cash and marketable securities  the company performed a sensitivity analysis to determine the hypothetical impact of a decrease in interest rate of basis points

foreign currency risk 
international revenues accounted for approximately of total revenues for the year ended september   compared to of total revenues for the year ended september  international revenues increased million or compared to the prior year 
the growth in our international operations has increased our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expense generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
primary currencies include the united kingdom pound sterling  the euro and the canadian dollar 
the statement of operations is translated into united states dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the united states dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the translation of these foreign currencies denominated transactions results in reduced revenues  operating expense  and net income for our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses  and net income will increase for our international operations  if the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been lower than we reported by approximately million and our international income from operations would have not been materially different 
using the average foreign currency exchange rates from  our international revenues for would have been lower than we reported by approximately million and our international income from operations would have been lower than we reported by million 
we are also exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we convert the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries and our investments in equity interests into united states dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the conversion of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into united states dollars will lead to a translation gain or loss which is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income which is a component of stockholders equity 
in addition  we have certain assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies other than the relevant entity s functional currency 
changes in the functional currency value of these assets and liabilities create fluctuations that will lead to a transaction gain or loss 
for the fiscal years ended september   and  we recorded net foreign currency transaction gains and losses  realized and unrealized  of approximately million  million  and million  respectively  which were recorded in other income expense  net  in the consolidated statements of operations
