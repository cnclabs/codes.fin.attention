overview we are an outsourcing solutions provider for the education community 
under the varsitybooks and campus outfitters brands  we offer a comprehensive outsource solution to provide textbooks  uniforms and school supplies to private k schools  colleges  and distance and continuing education markets 
through our textbook and uniform outsource solutions  schools are released from the operational and financial challenges associated with managing highly seasonal retail operations and are free to focus on their core educational mission 
parents and students benefit from the increased convenience and value associated with our comprehensive textbook and uniform programs 
we were incorporated in december and began offering books for sale on our website on august  prior to  our revenues consisted primarily of sales of new textbooks 
in may  we acquired campus outfitters  a retailer of school uniforms to the private k school marketplace  and introduced school uniforms as a second revenue stream into our business 
to date  the primary channel for textbook sales has been through online ecommerce transactions  while the majority of uniform sales have been recognized through retail stores and on campus sales events 
our original sales model focused on building a broad consumer brand offering promotions and deeply discounted textbook prices to entice college students to visit our website and purchase their textbooks from us 
however  during we began to focus resources on the growth and development of our edupartners program  whereby we became a provider of new textbooks and learning materials to private middle and high school  college  distance  and continuing education markets 
this model represents the overwhelming majority of our textbook business today 
fiscal marked a significant milestone for us as we recorded the first profitable fiscal year in our company 
this was accomplished through a combination of revenue growth  margin enhancement and cost reduction efforts initiated during as part of this transformation we successfully lowered our overall expense structure and improved the margins of our retail book business while growing edupartners revenues 
in may  as part of our strategy to expand the number of services and products we offer our customers  we acquired campus outfitters 
through the campus outfitters brand  varsity group owns and operates nine retail locations serving private k school communities as their official school uniform provider 
parents and students are also able to purchase uniforms and related items via on campus sales events which are held at eligible schools as well as online through customized virtual stores which are created on www 
campusoutfitters 
com for each partner school containing all required uniform components 
we believe with the campus outfitters acquisition  we now have the opportunity to begin cross selling our textbook and uniform model between our combined network of existing customers 
beginning in the second quarter of  we moved aggressively to launch service offerings outside our core book and uniform offerings 
significant costs were incurred in this effort 
in november  due to the financial impact of cost increases together with limited new revenue generation from non book uniform service offerings  efforts to launch service offerings outside the book and uniform areas were terminated or suspended 
significant cost reductions have been implemented  and our current strategy includes only the book  uniform and school supplies businesses 
we believe the textbook model affords our company certain scale benefits that will allow us to grow revenues while maintaining margins 
we will continue to cross promote our school uniform solution to our textbook customers and our textbook solution to our uniform customers 
we will strive to expand the addressable market of target schools by continuously improving and refining our core textbook and uniform solutions  as well as exploring cost effective means for delivering new products and services  book and non book related  to meet the demand of our customers 
in view of the rapidly evolving nature of our business and our limited operating history  we have limited experience forecasting our revenues 
therefore we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results might not necessarily be meaningful and you should not rely on them as an indication of future performance 
seasonality we experience significant seasonality in our results of operations 
consistent with our focus on the expansion of edupartners and introduction of campus outfitters uniform model and their current concentration of private middle and high school institutions  since the year ended december   our peak selling period is the july august september back to school season 
during fiscal and  approximately and of our revenues  respectively  were recognized in this period 
we expect this trend to continue during fiscal while many private middle and high school institutions have an active book buying season in december january  the volume of purchases are typically significantly lower than the initial back to school season 
historically  campus outfitters has experienced the same seasonality in its results of operations 
consistent with its current concentration of private elementary  middle and high schools  campus outfitters peak selling season has been july august september back to school season 
part of our strategy is to extend our textbook program more deeply into the college and distance learning markets  expand our uniform model to more broadly incorporate branded apparel and identify profitable new products or services to market to our existing customer base 
this could result in more balanced revenues throughout the year 
however  based upon our current program  product and school mix  we will continue to experience significant fluctuations in quarterly operating results

critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
for a comprehensive discussion of our accounting policies  see note in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we do not have any ownership interest in any special purpose or similar entities and do not have any significant related party transactions 
pursuant to guidance published by the sec regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified the following accounting policies as critical to the understanding of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from textbook and uniform sales  net of any discounts and coupons  when our customers receive the products 
we take title to new textbooks sold online via our edupartners program upon transfer to the shipper and assume the risks and rewards of ownership including the risk of loss for collection 
we take title to our uniform and textbook inventory held at our retail locations at the time of purchase from the supplier  publisher or buyback customer and we place them in inventory as available for sale at that time 
we do not function as an agent or broker for our supplier see note to the consolidated financial statements 
outbound shipping charges are included in net sales 
we provide allowances for sales returns  promotional discounts and coupons based on historical experience in the period of the sale 
through may  our revenues have consisted primarily of sales of textbooks 
after our acquisition of campus outfitters in may  our revenues have consisted of sales of textbooks and uniforms 
deferred income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance is established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  management reviews both positive and negative evidence pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
 including current and historical results of operations  the annual limitation on utilization of net operating loss carryforwards pursuant to internal revenue code section  future income projections and the overall prospects of our business 
we performed our regular assessment of realization of our net deferred tax assets as of september  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 requires that all available evidence  both positive and negative  be considered in determining whether a valuation allowance is needed relating to net deferred tax assets 
cumulative losses in recent years represent significant negative evidence under sfas no 
after considering our pretax losses for the nine months ended september  and the expectation of a pre tax loss for the full year of  we concluded  based on the criteria outlined in sfas no 
 that the significance of the negative evidence of cumulative losses from the most recent years could not be overcome as there was insufficient objective evidence at this time that the deferred tax assets would be realized through future taxable income or available tax planning strategies 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge in the third quarter of of million to increase the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
with this increase  we have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
this non cash charge has been recorded in the provision for income taxes in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on future tax benefits until other positive evidence is sufficient to justify realization 
any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance would result in additional or lower income tax expense in such period and could have a significant impact on that period s earnings 
stock based compensation plans on january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of non cash compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors based on estimated fair values 
sfas no 
r supersedes the company s previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb  for periods beginning in fiscal in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  relating to sfas no 
r 
the company has applied the provisions of sab in its adoption of sfas no 
r 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  the company previously accounted for its stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb and related interpretations  and provided the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application transition method and recognized approximately  in expense related to the adoption of the new accounting standard in the year ended december  valuation of inventories inventories  consisting of textbooks and uniforms available for sale  are valued at the lower of cost or market value  net of an obsolescence allowance and are accounted for principally using the fifo method 
our inventory balance as of december  consists mainly of new book inventory primarily held at b t  our fulfillment partner  acquired by b t or by the company in support of our edupartners program for which they generally do not have standard return privileges with the publisher or new textbooks that we are able to procure from publishers at better terms than those available to b t 
new textbooks also include inventory held at campus outfitters retail locations and new textbooks held at other locations 
our book inventory also consists of used textbooks that we purchased during fiscal our inventory also consists of uniforms or apparel located in our college park warehouse or at our retail locations 
historically  approximately of the unsold new textbook inventory held by b t in support of our edupartners program has been returned for full credit with publishers  which substantially reduces our risk of inventory obsolescence 
we take title to the remaining unsold inventory and write down this balance  as well as any remaining used book inventory  for estimated excess and obsolete or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions on a quarterly basis 
business acquisition and valuation and impairment review of long lived assets we accounted for our purchases of campus outfitters in may and iq digital in may in accordance statement of financial accounting standards no 
business combinations sfas and accounted for the related acquired intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  we allocated the cost of our acquisitions to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities assumed  with the remaining amount being classified as goodwill 
management s estimates of the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired was based on discounted cash flow techniques that included significant estimates about future performance 
as required by sfas  we test goodwill for impairment annually and any time a triggering indicator exists 
during our third and fourth quarters of  the uniform business of campus outfitters experienced unexpected operational difficulties  which negatively affected its financial performance and the overall performance of varsity group  contributing to a significant decrease in varsity group market capitalization during the fourth quarter of accordingly  we performed a goodwill impairment test for our uniform reporting unit as of december  by applying a fair value based test and we believed that the carrying value of our uniform segment goodwill exceeded its fair value and therefore  recorded a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
this conclusion was based on our judgment  taking into consideration expectations regarding future profitability and the status of the uniform reporting unit that has reported goodwill 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets and the annual impairment tests required by sfas requires that we make estimates of future revenues  customer retention rates  estimated useful lives and other assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
this impairment expense is included in the impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles line item in our consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we decided to terminate or suspend new service offerings launched earlier in the fiscal year  which included closing its iq digital office 
accordingly  we recognized impairment charges in our solutions business unit of approximately million against goodwill and approximately million against other intangible assets 
this impairment expense is included in the impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles line item in our consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december  we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including software developed for internal use and acquired definite life intangible assets  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
when we determine that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  we generally measure any impairment as the amount by which the carrying amount of a long lived asset exceeded its fair value 
fair value is based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
to the extent the unamortized capitalized costs exceed the net fair value  the excess amount is written off 
in accordance with sfas  we recorded a write off of approximately  during the fiscal year ended december  related to the discontinued use of our lydia learn software 
also  during our third and fourth quarters of  the uniform business of campus outfitters experienced unexpected operational difficulties  which negatively affected its financial performance and the overall performance of varsity group  triggering  in connection with a fas review of goodwill  a uniform segment goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
accordingly  in accordance with sfas  we performed additional impairment testing for definite life intangible assets acquired as part of our acquisition of campus outfitters for our uniform reporting unit as of december  by applying a fair value based test 
these definite life intangible assets include customer related assets  non compete agreements and trademarks 
we believed that the carrying value of our uniform segment definite life intangible assets exceeded their fair value and therefore  recorded an impairment charge of approximately million 
this conclusion was based on our judgment  taking into consideration expectations regarding future profitability and the status of the uniform reporting unit 
this impairment expense is included in the impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles line item in our consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended december  evaluating long lived assets for impairment involves judgments as to when an asset may potentially be impaired 
we consider there to be a risk of impairment if there is a significant decrease in the market value of an asset or if there is a significant change in the extent or intended use of an asset 
results of operations fiscal years ended december  net sales textbooks uniforms solutions shipping total net sales operating expenses cost of textbooks cost of uniforms cost of shipping cost of solutions sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of acquired intangibles impairment of goodwill and acquired intangibles total operating expenses loss income from operations other income  net loss income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales net sales increased  or million  to million for the year ended december  uniform revenue introduced with our acquisition of campus outfitters in may represented approximately million of this increase  textbook revenue represented approximately million of this increase and shipping and solutions revenue represented approximately million of this increase 
an increase in online textbook revenue was largely offset by the non renewal of an on campus bookstore management agreement that represented approximately million of revenue during fiscal and generated no revenue during fiscal the remaining increase was due to the growth of textbook and related revenues attributable to the increase in the number of schools we serviced during compared to the prior year period 
net sales consist of sales of textbooks and uniforms and charges to customers for outbound shipping and are net of allowances for returns  promotional discounts and coupons 
revenues from sales are recognized at the time products are received by the customer 
over time  expansion of used book revenue as a percentage of total revenues may serve to lower textbook revenue growth since used books are typically priced at a discount to comparable new textbooks 
however  the related decrease in revenue growth is typically offset by higher gross margins associated with the sale of used books

operating expenses cost of textbooks cost of textbooks consists of the cost of textbooks and related education material sold to customers 
cost of textbooks increased  or approximately million  to approximately million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to our increased sales volume 
expressed as a percentage of related revenue  cost of textbooks was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this decrease in fiscal was largely attributable to a increase in units of used books sold during as compared to the prior year period 
cost of textbooks varies with textbook revenue and we expect these costs to increase in absolute dollars as our customer base and number of partner schools served expands 
please see forward looking statements 
cost of uniforms cost of uniforms consists of the cost of uniforms and apparel sold to customers 
cost of uniforms increased  or approximately million  to approximately million for the year ended december  expressed as a percentage of related revenue  cost of uniforms was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase is costs as a percentage of related revenue in fiscal were largely attributable to year over year price increases in product  which were not passed on to our customers and integration issues related to the acquisition of campus outfitters 
before our acquisition of campus outfitters in may  campus outfitters had been privately owned and operated and possessed minimal inventory and purchasing management  data and controls 
in order to integrate the campus outfitters acquisition  we began upgrading virtually all aspects of its transaction processing systems  including order management  cash and credit card processing  purchasing  inventory management and shipping 
while many of the systems were upgraded in time  we did experience delays in the release of our new order management and inventory management software systems  which contributed to operational difficulties that was a considerable factor contributing to the cause of the increase in cost of uniforms 
cost of uniforms varies with uniform revenue and we expect these costs to increase in absolute dollars as our customer base expands 
please see forward looking statements 
cost of shipping cost of shipping consists of outbound shipping to our customers 
cost of shipping increased  or approximately million  to approximately million  for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to our increased sales volume 
expressed as a percentage of related revenue  cost of shipping was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this increase was largely the result of campus outfitter integration issues mentioned earlier 
uniforms and textbooks that are not in stock at campus outfitter on campus road shows or in retail stores for our customers are generally shipped directly to customers free of shipping charges 
also contributing to the increase are higher shipping costs related to an increase in multiple shipments from different warehouses in order to optimize reduction in delivery time and price increases we did not pass on to our customers 
we expect that shipping margins will improve in fiscal once our new order management and inventory management software systems are fully implemented 
certain aspects of our agreements with b t provide for the assignment of separate values to the separate services provided by them supply of books  shipping and other services  including website content and customer database management
