item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our results of operations and financial condition as of december  should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
also  additional information on our revenues and operations can found above in business general overview and operating strategy 
the company sponsors and promotes outdoor motorsports events 
weather conditions surrounding these events affect sales of tickets  concessions and souvenirs  among other things 
although the company sells a substantial number of tickets well in advance of its larger events  poor weather conditions can have a negative effect on the company s results of operations 
poor weather can affect current periods as well as successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success of past events 
significant growth in our revenues will depend  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as further described in capital expenditures below  we have several capital projects underway at each of our speedways 
management does not believe the company s financial performance has been materially affected by inflation  and has generally been able to mitigate the effects of inflation by increasing prices 
results of operations revenues and expenses our revenues and expenses are classified in the following categories because they are important to  and used by  management in assessing operations admissions  event related revenue  nascar broadcasting revenue  and other operating revenue 
admissions includes ticket sales for all of our events 
event related revenue includes amounts received from sponsorship and naming rights fees  luxury suite rentals  event souvenir merchandise sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  promotional and hospitality revenues  track rentals  driving school and karting revenues  broadcasting rights other than nascar broadcasting revenue  and other event and speedway related revenues 
nascar broadcasting revenue includes rights fees obtained for domestic television broadcasts of nascar sanctioned events held at the company s speedways

earnings or losses on equity investees include the company s share of its motorsports authentics merchandising joint venture equity investee profits or losses 
see business operations above for additional information on the composition of our revenues  including non merchandise and merchandise revenue sources 
our revenue items produce different operating margins 
broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals produce higher margins than non event merchandise sales  as well as sales of tsi  legends cars  oil chem  smi trackside  mbm  bulk petroleum transactions  oil and gas exploration and production activities  or other operating revenues 
the company classifies expenses to include direct expense of events  nascar purse and sanction fees  and other direct operating expense  among other categories

most of the company s  and several of its  nascar nextel cup and busch event sponsorships are already sold  and pre sales for other corporate event related revenues are showing similar trends 
net deferred race event income at december  as compared to december  is higher principally due to increases in advance corporate sponsorship and other promotional revenues for upcoming nascar nextel cup and busch series racing events 
despite poor weather surrounding certain nascar racing events held at ams  bms and lvms in the first quarter  almost million fans attended our events in  demonstrating that demand and appeal for motorsports entertainment in our markets has remained strong even in challenging circumstances 
for the company s upcoming events  tickets are essentially sold out for bms s and lvms s march nextel cup events 
ticket sales at ams and lms were similar to  and at tms were below  ticket sales at the same time last year 
however  at this early date  management is unable to determine whether event results will differ from those previously estimated 
fuel prices and interest rates have risen for various reasons  including geopolitical  economic and other factors and may continue to rise 
natural disasters such as hurricanes katrina and rita can cause significant increases in fuel prices and significant adverse economic effects 
the national incidents of september   along with the iraq war and terrorism alerts  have raised a combination of operating factors rarely encountered  including public concerns regarding air travel  military actions  and additional national or local catastrophic incidents 
economic conditions could be severely affected by future actual or threatened events of a similar nature or other national  regional or local incidents  which could materially adversely affect the company s future operating results 
although the company sells a substantial number of tickets well in advance of its larger events  poor weather conditions surrounding racing events can have a negative effect on successive events in future periods because consumer demand can be affected by the success of past events 
these factors affect consumer and corporate spending sentiment 
reduced consumer spending impacted admissions and the demand for souvenir  apparel and other merchandise at certain non event company and outside venues  with related effects on event related and other operating revenues 
while management believes the company s strong operating cash flow will continue  economic conditions  rising fuel prices  and the competitiveness of racing can affect ticket  corporate marketing  sponsorships and other sales 
management believes long term ticket demand  including corporate marketing and promotional spending  should continue to grow 
however  management decided not to increase many ticket and concession prices in to help foster fan support and mitigate any near term demand weakness 
nascar broadcasting rights agreement fiscal was our sixth year under the initial multi year consolidated domestic television broadcast rights agreement for nascar nextel cup and busch series events 
our nascar broadcasting revenues were million  reflecting an increase of approximately million or over broadcasting revenues continue to be a significant long term revenue source for our core business  representing approximately of our total revenues 
a substantial portion of our recent profit growth has resulted from a significant increase in our television revenues received from the arrangements nascar has made with various television networks 
nascar ratings may also impact attendance at company events and sponsorship opportunities 
the speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k six year nascar domestic television broadcast rights agreements with nbc sports  turner sports  fox and fx expired after nascar recently announced that it reached new combined eight year agreements with fox  abc espn  tnt and speed channel for the domestic broadcast rights to all nascar nextel cup and busch series events for through nascar also announced that these agreements have a billion contract period value  representing approximately million in gross average annual rights fees for the industry and a increase over the current contract annual average of million 
however  the recently announced nascar total industry rights fees will approximate million  which are lower than the rights fees of approximately million 
although initially lower  this eight year arrangement provides the company significant increases in average annual contracted revenues through  with increases averaging per year 
our total contracted revenues under the upcoming domestic broadcast rights agreement for  based on the current race schedule  are approximately million  reflecting a decrease of approximately million or from these lower revenues will be partially offset by an approximate million decrease in associated contracted nascar purse and sanction fees 
management believes this new long term contracted revenue source helps solidify our financial strength and stabilize our earnings and cash flows  and bodes well for smi and our industry in the future 
management also believes these new contracts have long term strategic benefits 
for instance  over the past several years major sports programming has begun to shift between network and cable 
cable broadcasters can support a higher investment through subscriber fees not available to networks  which is resulting in increased rights fees for these sports properties 
however  cable reaches fewer households than network broadcasts 
nascar s decision to retain approximately two thirds of its event schedule on network television is believed to be important to the sport s future growth  and should continue to drive increased fan and media awareness for all three nascar racing series  which should help increase long term attendance and corporate marketing appeal 
management believes espn s involvement should result in the busch series benefiting from the improved continuity of season long presence on espn  and motorsports in general should benefit from increased ancillary programming and nightly and weekly nascar branded programming and promotions  similar to that espn provides with the other major sports 
future changes in race schedules would impact these amounts 
similar to many televised sports  overall seasonal averages for motorsports may increase or decrease from year to year  while television ratings for certain individual events may fluctuate from year to year for any number of reasons 
while this long term rights agreement will likely result in annual revenue increases over the contract period  associated annual increases in purse and sanction fees paid to nascar may continue 
the company s share of the television broadcast revenues are contracted  and purse and sanction fees are negotiated  with nascar on an annual basis 
oil and gas activities the company is engaged in the purchase and sale of bulk petroleum products  associated commodity transactions  and oil and gas exploration and production activities 
the company has conducted these business activities primarily in russia  central america  north america  south america  africa  and the united kingdom 
the company may expand such business activities into asia and the middle east  among other foreign regions 
oasis trading group llc oasis  a united states company  provides the company strategic  management and operational capabilities in connection with these activities 
the company provides financing and access to financial markets for such activities 
the company and oasis generally share equally the profits and losses on all transactions and activities 
at times  the company enters into futures contracts associated with petroleum products and utilizes letters of credit for the purchase and sale of bulk petroleum products 
the company also has profit and loss sharing arrangements with certain foreign entities on the purchasing and selling of specified bulk petroleum products  and the company s share of profits and losses is negotiated on a transaction by transaction basis  but generally ranges from to 
purchases  sales  bulk petroleum  oil and gas activities  futures contracts  and letters of credit hereafter are collectively associated with or referred to as oil and gas activities  oil and gas business  oil and gas transactions or bulk petroleum transactions 
in may  the company formed speedway motorsports international limited bvi smil  a wholly owned subsidiary of oil chem  to conduct oil and gas exploration and production activities  and possibly expand into asia  the middle east and other foreign regions 
since may and through december   smil has acquired and majority interests in two foreign entities owning certain oil and gas mineral rights in russia for approximately million 
the company s credit facility contains a separate sub limit for letters of credit up to million for use in oil and gas activities and other business transactions  permits the company to invest up to an additional aggregate of million in oil chem and its direct or indirect subsidiaries for oil and gas activities  and allows for contracts and certain contract assignments  associated with the company s oil and gas activities  to specified foreign parties 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k as further described below in critical accounting policies and accounting estimates revenue recognition for oil and gas activities  gross revenues and product and associated operating costs from oil and gas transactions are included in other operating revenue and other direct operating expense  respectively 
operating profits or losses associated with energy supply contracts are reported on a net basis in other operating revenue 
there were no oil and gas transactions reported on a gross basis in or for oil and gas transactions reported on a gross basis during  revenues totaled approximately million 
for oil and gas transactions reported on a net basis  associated billings totaled approximately million in  million in and million in  and associated profits  excluding recovery allowances  amounted to approximately million in and million in net gains or losses on such amounts in were not significant 
there were no revenues from russian oil and gas exploration and production activities in and associated operating costs were not significant 
as of december   the company was party to certain futures contracts associated with bulk petroleum inventory 
these instruments were current liabilities having a fair market value of  as of december  there were no futures contracts outstanding as of december  although these oil and gas activities have increased and may increase further  the company s core business has been and remains motorsports 
management recognizes that this oil and gas business has financial and operational risks different from those of our core operations 
many are risks ordinarily experienced by any new business  risks ordinarily associated with conducting business in foreign countries  as well as risks generally associated with petroleum products  commodities  oil and gas activities  hedging and similar transactions of this nature 
however  the company s oil and gas activities involve concentrations of credit and other risks different from motorsports operations as of december  these credit and other risks are further described below  in part i item a risk factors our oil and gas business incurs financial and operational risks different from those of our other operations  and in note to the consolidated financial statements oil and gas activities 
at december   uncertainty exists as to the full realization of receivables due from two foreign entities and oasis under certain profit and loss sharing arrangements 
uncertainty exists about collecting amounts from two foreign entities because of problems with respect to access to funds  creditworthiness and certain other factors outside of management s control when conducting operations in a foreign country 
management is currently pursuing available recoverability alternatives 
under its profit and loss sharing arrangement  the company has recorded receivables from oasis  a significant portion of which pertains to that entity s reimbursable share of loss associated with the recoverability assessment of amounts due from these two foreign entities 
oasis s ability to repay the company this or any future amount is largely dependent on sufficient profitability of future oil and gas activities  therefore  uncertainty exists regarding recoverability and amounts due were reserved as of december  as of december   the company has recorded allowances for possible uncollectible amounts of approximately million based on estimated ultimate realization after possible recovery  settlement and other costs and insurance 
in  recovery allowances of approximately million are reflected in other direct operating expense 
this assessment is subjective and based on facts  circumstances and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  all of which are subject to significant change 
such changes  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse impact on the outcome of management s realization assessment and the company s future financial condition or results of operations 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has credit risk concentration in receivables associated with bulk petroleum sales and purchase transactions as of december  approximately million or of the company s total net current accounts and notes receivables are due from a relatively small number of petroleum industry customers and merchants in central america and russia 
also  from time to time  bulk petroleum inventory products may be located in and managed by a relatively small number of vendors in central america or russia 
as discussed above  smil holds and majority interests in two foreign entities owning certain oil and gas mineral rights in russia 
as of december   amounts invested in these entities aggregate approximately million  consisting principally of capitalized costs for oil and gas mineral rights  road construction  and exploration and drilling predominately with unproven reserves and  to a lesser extent  proven reserves accounted for under the full cost accounting method 
these entities are consolidated  however  their operations  including minority interests  through december  were not significant 
as of december   the company had no outstanding letters of credit associated with oil and gas activities and no bulk petroleum product inventory 
non event and event souvenir and other merchandising revenues management intends to develop new merchandising opportunities  expand product offerings through electronic media promotional programming  and market racing and other sports related souvenir merchandise and apparel with corporate customers and other third party speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k venues 
the company s merchandising event related and other operating revenues may increase or decrease depending on  among other factors  the success of such efforts  the success of motorsports  particularly nascar s nextel cup series  and future market demand  trends and competition for our non event products and outside venues 
the company s ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors both within and outside management s control 
these revenue items may produce lower operating margins than broadcast rights  sponsorships  ticket sales  commissions from food and beverage sales  and luxury suite and track rentals 
while our revenues may increase  there may be associated increases in receivables and inventory levels whose realization is subject to changes in market and economic conditions and other factors that might adversely impact realization 
earnings guidance in connection with our fourth quarter and full year earnings release  management provided full year guidance of per diluted share assuming current industry and economic trends continue  and excluding our share of motorsports authentics joint venture operating results  changes in the company s non core businesses  capital expenditures exceeding our current plans  the impact of further increases in fuel prices  interest rates  geopolitical conflicts and other unforeseen factors 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total revenues for increased by million  or  over such revenues for due to the factors discussed below 
admissions for decreased by million  or  from such revenue for essentially all of this decrease is due to lower overall attendance at nascar sanctioned racing events 
the decrease reflects lower attendance at nascar sanctioned racing events held at lms and tms in the current period  which management believes were negatively impacted by rising fuel prices and interest rates and declines in consumer spending 
the overall decrease was partially offset by continued growth in admissions at nascar sanctioned racing events held at lvms and  to a lesser degree  at ams october and bms august in the current period 
also  admissions revenue was negatively impacted by poor weather surrounding certain nascar racing events held at ams  bms and lvms in the first quarter event related revenue for increased by million  or  over such revenue for approximately of this increase is due to higher sponsorship  display advertising  luxury suite rentals  camping and other event related revenues associated with nascar sanctioned racing events held in compared to also  revenues of jrg driving school acquired in july  ancillary broadcasting rights and track rentals increased approximately over the overall increase was partially offset by lower commissions from food and beverage sales and souvenir sales that were negatively impacted by poor weather surrounding certain nascar racing events held at ams  bms and lvms in the first quarter nascar broadcasting revenue for increased by million  or  over such revenue for this increase is due to increases in annual contractual broadcast rights fees for nascar sanctioned racing events held in the current period 
other operating revenue for decreased by million  or  from such revenue for this decrease is primarily due to approximately lower oil and gas related revenues as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  and approximately lower tsi non event merchandising revenues in the current period 
the overall decrease was partially offset by higher speedway club and legends car revenues in the current period 
direct expense of events for decreased by million  or  from such expense for essentially all of this decrease is due to lower insurance costs  and lower souvenir sales resulting from the negative impact of poor weather surrounding certain nascar racing events held at ams  bms and lvms in the first quarter the overall decrease was partially offset by higher operating costs associated with the growth in event related revenues  and to operating costs associated with current period revenues of jrg acquired in july nascar purse and sanction fees for increased by million  or  over such expense for this increase is due to higher annual contractual race purses and sanctioning fees for nascar sanctioned racing events held in the current period 
other direct operating expense for decreased by million or  from such expense for this decrease is due primarily to lower oil and gas product and operating expenses  net of recovery allowances for certain oil and gas transactions  as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements

the overall decrease was partially offset by increased operating costs associated with speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k higher speedway club and legends car revenues in the current period 
general and administrative expense for increased by million  or  over such expense for approximately of this increase is due to higher operating costs associated with growth and expansion at the company s speedways and operations  and approximately is due to stock compensation expense reflected under sfas no 
r share based payment as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased by million  or  over such expense for this increase is due primarily to increased depreciation expense from additions to property and equipment at the company s speedways and other facilities  and reflects cessation of depreciation on property and equipment damaged by the tornado that struck ams in july and current period depreciation on reconstructed ams facilities when placed into service 
interest expense  net for was million compared to million for the change reflects interest expense associated with a cash flow hedge swap agreement  higher investment interest rates on invested cash balances and higher capitalized interest in those changes were offset by increased average interest rates on borrowings under the bank revolving credit facility  and to a lesser degree  lower interest income earned from lower average invested cash balances  during the current period

net income for increased by million  or  over such income for this increase is due to the factors discussed above 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s business has been  and is expected to remain  highly seasonal 
the company sometimes produces minimal operating income during the third quarter when it hosts only one major nascar race weekend 
concentration of racing events in any particular future quarter  and the growth in the company s operations with attendant increases in overhead expenses  may tend to minimize operating income in respective future quarters 
racing schedules may change from time to time which can lessen the comparability of operating results between quarters of successive years and increase or decrease the seasonal nature of the company s motorsports business 
the quarterly information below shows excerpted results from the company s quarterly reports on form q filed in the years ended december  and see results of operations racing events above for additional comparative information on our major nascar sanctioned racing events held in and  and scheduled to be held in as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements oil and gas activities  the operating results for the fourth quarter include a recovery allowance reflected for certain oil and gas transactions

the company repurchased  and  shares of common stock for approximately million in and million in capital expenditures management believes significant growth in the company s revenues depends  in part  on consistent investment in facilities 
as such  the company expects to continue to make substantial capital improvements in its facilities to meet increasing demand and to increase revenue 
currently  a number of significant capital projects are underway 
projects at december   the company had various construction projects underway to increase and improve facilities for fan amenities and for other site improvements at our speedways 
similar to prior years  we continue to expand concessions  camping  restrooms and other fan amenities at certain facilities 
in  lvms began construction and renovation of an infield media center  garage  fan zone entertainment facilities with leading edge technology infrastructure and access for increased appeal to media content providers  racing team owners and drivers and others involved in motorsports  which is expected to be completed in in  lms plans to start renovating and modernizing certain grandstand seating and expand its hospitality areas  and bms plans to resurface its high banked speedway

the estimated aggregate cost of capital expenditures in is approximately to million  excluding lvms s condominium project 
management plans to fund these capital expenditures with available cash and cash investments  working capital or borrowings under the revolving facility as needed 
numerous factors  many of which are beyond the company s control  may influence the ultimate costs and timing of various capital improvements at its facilities  including undetected soil or land conditions  additional land acquisition costs  increases in the cost of construction materials and labor  unforeseen changes in design  litigation  accidents or natural disasters affecting the construction site  and national or regional economic changes 
in addition  the actual cost could vary materially from estimates if assumptions about the quality of materials or workmanship required or the cost of financing such construction were to change 
construction is also subject to state and local permitting processes  which if changed  could materially adversely affect the ultimate cost and timing of construction 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k the company also continually evaluates new opportunities that will add value for its stockholders  including the acquisition and construction of new speedway facilities  the expansion and development of existing oil and gas business  legends cars and oil chem products and markets  and the expansion into new and complementary businesses 
dividends any decision concerning the payment of common stock dividends depends upon the company s results of operations  financial condition and capital expenditure plans  applicable limitations under the credit facility and senior subordinated notes  and other factors the board of directors  in its sole discretion  may consider relevant 
as further described above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the credit facility allows annual aggregate payments of dividends and repurchases of smi securities of up to million  and increasable up to million  subject to maintaining certain financial covenants 
the senior subordinated notes indenture permits annual dividend payments of up to approximately per share of common stock  increasable subject to meeting certain financial covenants

critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the financial statement date  and reported amounts of revenues and expenses  including amounts that are susceptible to change 
the company continually reviews its accounting policies and accounting estimates  and the application and effect on its financial statements and disclosures  for conformity with gaap  including relevance  accuracy  completeness and non omission of material information 
the company s critical accounting policies include accounting methods and estimates underlying such financial statement preparation  as well as judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies 
in applying critical accounting policies and making estimates  materially different amounts or results could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  and the consolidated financial statements  including the associated notes  appearing elsewhere in this report 
as indicated below  certain accounting policies that are described in note to the consolidated financial statements are not repeated in this section 
the company believes the critical accounting policies  including amounts involving significant estimates  uncertainties and susceptibility to change include the following recoverability of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  and equity investments in associated entities as of december   the company has net property and equipment of  million including capitalized oil and gas exploration and production costs associated with consolidated foreign entities of million  net goodwill and other intangible assets of million  and equity investments in associated entities of million 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company follows sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets which specifies  among other things  nonamortization of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives and expanded testing for possible impairment at least annually 
when events or circumstances indicate possible impairment may have occurred  the company evaluates long lived assets  including tangible assets and intangible assets subject to amortization  for possible impairment based on expected future undiscounted operating cash flows attributable to such assets using sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the evaluation is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
management believes no impairment exists at december   however  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of the impairment evaluation and the financial condition or future results of operations 
there are various business and other factors associated with recoverability and impairment that are further described in item a risk factors above 
depreciable and amortizable lives for property and equipment and intangible assets depreciation and amortization is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the company has net property and equipment of  million and net amortizable intangible assets of million as of december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the company s property and equipment  other intangible assets and estimated useful lives 
as of december   the company has nonamortizable intangible assets of million and goodwill of million for race event sanctioning and renewal agreements that are considered to have indefinite useful lives because their renewal and cash flow generation is expected to continue indefinitely 
useful lives are estimated based on outside cost segregation and valuation studies conducted on purchased or constructed speedway property and equipment and purchased intangible assets  historical experience  intended use  condition  available information for comparable assets  and other factors and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation 
management periodically reviews the estimated useful lives used to record depreciation and amortization expense  and believes such estimated useful lives are appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
management also periodically reviews whether non amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets remains appropriate  and believes such non amortization is appropriate and no changes are expected at this time 
however  because the company has a material investment in depreciable property and equipment and intangible assets  changes in depreciable and amortizable lives  should they occur  could have a significant impact on its financial condition or future results of operations 
realization of receivables and inventories management assesses realization of accounts and notes receivable and inventories  including any need for allowances for doubtful accounts or inventories 
management considers such factors  among other things  as customer creditworthiness  historical collection and sales experience for receivables  and current inventory levels  current and future market demand  and trends and conditions for inventories 
the assessment is subjective and based on conditions  trends and assumptions existing at the time of evaluation  which are subject to changes in market and economic conditions  including changes or deterioration in customer financial condition or merchandising distribution and other factors  that might adversely impact realization 
if revenues increase  there may be associated increases in receivables and inventory levels whose realization is subject to these same conditions and factors 
as further described above in near term operating factors oil and gas activities and risk factors our oil and gas business incurs financial and operational risks different from those of its other operations  oil and gas transactions may involve factors and considerations with respect to the realization of receivables and inventories that are different from its motorsports operations 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future income tax effect of temporary differences between financial and income tax bases of assets and liabilities assuming they will be realized and settled at amounts reported in the financial statements 
management s accounting for income taxes reflects its assessment of future tax liabilities based on assumptions and estimates for timing  likelihood of realization  and tax laws existing at the time of evaluation 
at december   net deferred tax liabilities totaled million  after reduction for net deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax liabilities will likely reverse in future years and could negatively impact cash flows from operations in the years in which reversal occurs 
a valuation allowance of million is provided against deferred tax assets as of december  management has assessed the deferred tax assets  after reduction for the valuation allowance  and believes realization is more likely than not 
however  changes in tax laws  assumptions or estimates used in the accounting for income taxes  or changes or adjustments resulting from review by taxing authorities  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on amounts or timing of realization or settlement 
such effects could result in a material acceleration of income taxes currently payable or valuation charges for realization uncertainties  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or future results of operations 
the company s effective income tax rate was in compared to in as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements and below  the change was due primarily to decreased effective state income tax rates resulting from the state of texas replacing its current franchise tax with a defined margin tax  and to a lesser extent  the benefit of foreign tax credits and a favorable examination settlement 
our effective income tax rates in future years may or may not be impacted by similar or other tax matters  which could result in relative increases or decreases in future income tax expense 
speedway motorsports  inc annual report on form k tax filing change 
as further discussed in near term operating factors income taxes above and in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company has significant net noncurrent deferred tax liabilities  the majority of which pertain to accelerated depreciation on our property and equipment for tax reporting purposes 
in evaluating the potential effects of a tax advice memorandum published by the irs  the company filed in a change in tax accounting method with the irs with respect to  among other things  changing tax depreciation methods and extending depreciable lives for certain significant motorsports facility assets 
the tax method accounting change is expected to reduce the company s tax depreciation expense for certain previous years and is being included in federal and state taxable income over four years beginning in as of and through december   the change resulted in reclassifying noncurrent deferred income taxes of approximately million to current accrued income taxes and accelerating the payment of additional noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities of approximately million in each of and accelerated taxes of million were paid in management believes the company s use of a seven year recovery period prior to was appropriate in view of then existing tax law and related guidance 
management believes filing the change in tax accounting method was the best course of action to minimize costs and uncertainty 
management anticipates that cash and cash equivalents and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund these payments 
management believes the company has sufficiently provided for income taxes and associated reserves  and no current or future charge to earnings is expected at this time resulting from the tax accounting change 
these amounts should be substantially recovered in succeeding years from increased tax depreciation as these assets continue to be depreciated for tax purposes over longer periods 
as such  management does not believe the tax accounting change will have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position or results of operations 
defined margin tax 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements defined margin tax  in may  the state of texas enacted house bill the bill which replaces its current franchise tax with a defined margin tax  applies to taxable entities conducting business in texas  and is accounted for as an income tax under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
stipulates accounting for the effects of tax law changes in the period of enactment 
as such  the company accounted for the tax law change in its second quarter the effect was to reduce the company s income tax expense by approximately million  and effective income tax rate by  for the year ended december  the texas comptroller has requested a formal opinion from the texas attorney general on whether the margin tax is an impermissible income tax that violates the texas constitution 
texas law requires voter approval of any state income tax  and at this time  such approval had not been obtained for the bill 
if a constitutional challenge is filed  the bill gives the texas supreme court jurisdiction and allows the court to grant injunctive or declaratory relief 
the court would have days from the date the challenge is filed to make a ruling 
should the court grant injunctive and declaratory relief  or other legislative action occur in texas  which effectively overturns or reverses the bill  the company would likely be required to effect such further tax law change in the period of enactment 
the effect of any such change could increase the company s future income tax expense by amounts similar to that recorded in legal proceedings and contingencies as discussed above in legal proceedings and note to the consolidated financial statements  the company is involved in various legal matters and intends to continue to defend ourselves in existing legal actions in fiscal the company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance to manage various risks associated with its speedways  other properties and motorsports events  and other business risks 
see item a risk factors for additional information on our liability insurance program and self insurance retention 
the company accrues a liability for contingencies if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable 
the likelihood of an adverse outcome and estimation of amounts are assessed using legal counsel on litigation matters  outside insurance administrators and consultants for insured and self insured claims  along with historical trends  assumptions and other information available at the time of assessment 
management believes amounts requiring accrual are properly reflected in the accompanying financial statements 
management does not believe the outcome of the lawsuits  incidents or other legal or business risk matters  will have a material adverse effect on the company s future financial position or results of operations 
however  new or changes in pending or threatened legal action or claims against the company  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of these matters and the company s future financial condition or results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s financial instruments with interest rate risk exposure consist of cash and cash investments  notes receivable  the revolving facility  and an interest rate swap agreement that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
a change in interest rates of one percent on floating notes receivable and debt balances outstanding at december   excluding the interest rate swap  would cause an approximate change in annual interest income of  and annual interest expense of  interest rate swap values are affected by various market factors  including interest rate changes  which have a corresponding effect on interest expense 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company uses interest rate swap agreements at times for non trading purposes to hedge interest rate risk and optimize a combination of variable and fixed interest rate debt 
the company presently has one interest rate swap transaction related to variable rate debt obligations 
the swap has a principal notional amount of million  provides for quarterly settlement and expires corresponding with the debt term 
at december  and  the company has reflected a net derivative asset for this swap of approximately  and million 
fair value estimates are based on relevant market information at a specific point in time  and changes in assumptions or market conditions could significantly affect estimates 
as discussed in liquidity and capital resources above and note to the consolidated financial statements  the credit facility was amended in to  among other things  increase the revolving credit facility overall borrowing limit from million to million  reconstitute and convert outstanding borrowings under a five year term loan of million into borrowings under the revolving credit facility  and revive a previously expired accordion feature that provides for additional borrowings of up to million subject to meeting specified conditions
