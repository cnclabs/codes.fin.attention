item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that reflect our plans  estimates and beliefs 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below and those listed under risks factors 
executive level overview trimble s focus is on combining positioning technology with wireless communication and application capabilities to create system level solutions that enhance productivity and accuracy for our customers 
the majority of our markets are end user markets  including engineering and construction firms  governmental organizations  public safety workers  farmers and companies who must manage fleets of mobile workers and assets 
in our advanced devices segment  we also provide components to original equipment manufacturers to incorporate into their products 
in the end user markets  we provide a system that includes a hardware platform that may contain software and customer support 
some examples of our solutions include products that automate and simplify the process of surveying land  products that automate the utilization of equipment such as tractors and bulldozers  products that enable a company to manage its mobile workforce and assets  and products that allow municipalities to manage their fixed assets 
solutions targeted at the end user make up a significant majority of our revenue 
to create compelling products  we must attain an understanding of the end users needs and work flow  and how location based technology can enable that end user to work faster  more efficiently and more accurately 
we use this knowledge to create highly innovative products that change the way work is done by the end user 
with the exception of our tms segment  our products are generally sold through a dealer channel  and it is crucial that we maintain a proficient global  third party distribution channel 
during we continued to execute our strategy with a series of actions that can be summarized in four categories 
reinforcing our position in existing markets generally  we believe that our markets provide us with additional  substantial potential for substituting our technology for traditional methods 
in we continued to develop new products and to strengthen our distribution channels to realize these opportunities 
a number of new products such as trimble s  trimble sps robotic construction total station and the enhanced trimble gcs grade control system strengthened our competitive position and created new value for the user 
extend our position in existing markets through new product categories we are utilizing the strength of the trimble brand in our markets to expand our revenues by bringing new products to existing users 
a example was the introduction of the aggps ez boom product 
in order to create new categories of products on the construction site we acquired quantm  meridian  xyz solutions  and bitwyse 
bring existing technology to new markets we continue to reinforce our position in existing markets and positioned ourselves in newer markets that will serve as important sources of future growth 
our efforts in china  india  russia  korea and eastern europe all reflected improving financial results  with the promise of more in the future 
entered completely new markets in fiscal we acquired visual statement  which provides desktop software tools for crime and collision incident investigation  analysis  and reconstitution as well as state wide enterprise solutions for reporting and analysis used by public safety agencies  and eleven technology  inc  which is a mobile application software company with a leading position in the consumer packaged goods industry 
in addition  we increased our reach with existing products in new markets  particularly emerging markets such as china and india 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting polices 
these critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies 
revenue recognition our revenues are recorded in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition and in accordance with statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition and statement of position sop no 
 modification of sop 
the company recognizes product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer or is uncertain  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
contracts and customer purchase orders are typically used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
our shipment terms for us orders  and international orders fulfilled from its european distribution center are typically fca free carrier shipping point  except certain sales to us government agencies which are shipped fob destination 
fca shipping point means that we fulfill the obligation and title has passed to the buyer upon delivery of the goods to the carrier named by the buyer at the named place or point 
if no precise point is indicated by the buyer  we may choose within the place or range stipulated where the carrier will take the goods into carrier s charge 
fob destination means revenue for orders are not recognized until the product is delivered and title has transferred to the buyer 
we bear all costs and risks of loss or damage to the goods up to that point 
shipping and handling costs are included in the cost of goods sold 
revenue to distributors and resellers is recognized upon delivery  assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
distributors and resellers do not have a right of return 
revenues from purchased extended warranty and support agreements are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the warranty support period 
we apply statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition to products where the embedded software is more than incidental to the functionality of the hardware 
this determination requires significant judgment including a consideration of factors such as marketing  research and development efforts and any postcustomer contract support relating to the embedded software 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  when a non software sale involves multiple elements the entire fee from the arrangement is allocated to each respective element based on its relative fair value and recognized when revenue recognition criteria for each element are met 
our software arrangements generally consist of a perpetual license fee and post contract customer support pcs 
we have established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for our pcs contracts based on the renewal rate 
the remaining value of the software arrangement is allocated to the license fee using the residual method  which revenue is primarily recognized when the software has been delivered and there are no remaining obligations 
revenue from pcs is recognized ratably over the term of the pcs agreement 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns our accounts receivable balance  net of allowance for doubtful accounts  was million as of december   compared with million as of december  we evaluate the collectibility of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances  credit quality  historical experience  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance for bad debts is estimated and recorded which reduces the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  bad debt charges are recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 

table of contents a reserve for sales returns is established based on historical trends in product return rates experienced in the ordinary course of business 
the reserve for sales returns as of december  and december  were  and million  respectively  for estimated future returns that were recorded as a reduction of our accounts receivable and revenue 
if the actual future returns were to deviate from the historical data on which the reserve had been established  our revenue could be adversely affected 
inventory valuation our inventories  net balance was million as of december  compared with million as of december  our inventory allowances as of december  were million  compared with million as of december  our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with costs primarily computed on a standard cost basis 
adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value  if required  are made for estimated excess  obsolescence  or impaired inventory 
factors influencing these adjustments include decline in demand  technological changes  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing  physical deterioration  and quality issues 
if actual factors are less favorable than those projected by us  additional inventory write downs may be required 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the liability method whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized 
the company s valuation allowance is attributable to  primarily  the california research credit and acquisition net operating loss carryforwards 
valuation allowance amounts are offsets to related deferred tax assets 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the company will not realize these deferred tax assets and  accordingly  a valuation allowance has been established for such amounts 
when the tax credits are utilized and the valuation allowance is released  the benefit of the release of the valuation allowance will be accounted for as a credit to shareholder s equity rather than as a reduction of the income tax provision 
annual goodwill impairment test goodwill as of december  was million  compared with million as of december  the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant assumptions 
if an evaluation is required  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets would be compared to their carrying amount to determine if a write down to fair market value or discounted cash flow value is required 
we performed an annual impairment test of goodwill at the end of the third fiscal quarter of and and found there was no impairment of goodwill 
we will continue to evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis at the end of each fiscal third quarter and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the determination of the net carrying value of goodwill and the extent to which  if any  there is impairment are dependent on material estimates and judgments on our part  including the useful life over which the intangible assets are to be amortized  and the estimates of the value of future net cash flows  which are based upon further estimates of future revenues  expenses and operating income 
accounting for long lived assets including intangibles subject to amortization depreciation and amortization of our long lived assets is provided using straight line methods over their estimated useful lives 
changes in circumstances such as technological advances  changes to our business model  or changes in the capital strategy could result in the actual useful lives differing from initial estimates 
in those cases where we determine that the useful life of a long lived asset should be revised  we will depreciate the net book value in excess of the estimated residual value over its revised remaining useful life 
factors such as changes in the planned use of equipment  customer attrition  contractual amendments  or mandated regulatory requirements could result in shortened useful lives 

table of contents long lived assets and asset groups are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
the estimated future cash flows are based upon  among other things  assumptions about expected future operating performance and may differ from actual cash flows 
long lived assets evaluated for impairment are grouped with other assets to the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is less than the carrying value of the assets  the assets will be written down to the estimated fair value in the period in which the determination is made 
warranty costs the liability for product warranties was million as of december   compared with million as of december  we accrue for warranty costs as part of cost of sales based on associated material product costs  technical support labor costs  and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf 
our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
the products sold are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from days to three years  and in some instances up to years 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage  and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage  or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty accrual and related costs may be required 
stock compensation we apply standard of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan for fiscal as a result  the company s financial statements for fiscal include stock based compensation expenses that are not comparable to financial statements prior to fiscal prior to fiscal  we applied accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations in accounting for our stock option plans and stock purchase plan 
accordingly  we did not recognize compensation cost for stock options granted at a price equal to fair market value prior to fiscal for options granted prior to october   the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
for stock options granted on or after october   the fair value of each award is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial valuation model 
similar to the black scholes model  the binomial model takes into account variables such as volatility  dividend yield rate  and risk free interest rate 
in addition  the binomial model incorporates actual option pricing behavior 
for these reasons  we believe that the binomial model provides a fair value that is more representative of actual experience and future expected experience than the value calculated using the black scholes model 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements describes the plans we operate  and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contains a summary of the effects to reported net income and earnings per share for fiscal  and pro forma net income and earnings per share for fiscal and as if we had elected to recognize compensation cost based on the fair value of the options granted at grant date

during the fiscal year  sales to customers in the united states represented  europe represented  asia pacific represented and other regions represented of our total revenues 
we anticipate that sales to international customers will continue to account for a major portion of our revenues 
no single customer accounted for or more of our total revenues in fiscal   and it is possible  however  that in future periods the failure of one or more large customers to purchase products in quantities anticipated by us may adversely affect the results of operations 
gross margin our gross margin varies due to a number of factors including product mix  pricing  distribution channel used  effects of production volumes  new product start up costs  and foreign currency translations 
in fiscal  our gross margin increased by million as compared to fiscal due to higher revenue and the success of higher margin products  including survey and machine control products and higher subscription revenues 
the increase was partially offset by decreases due to the impact of the reclassification of the ctct transactions of million previously recorded in non operating expenses  amortization of software related purchased intangibles of million and stock based compensation expense of million that were not included in gross margin during the same period in fiscal gross margin as a percentage of total revenues was in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in the gross margin percentage was driven by a decrease of due to the ctct impact  amortization of purchased intangibles and stock based compensation  offset by an increase of due to higher margin products and subscription revenues

operating income loss equals net revenue less cost of sales and operating expenses  excluding general corporate expenses  amortization of purchased intangibles  in process research and development expenses  restructuring charges  non operating income expense  and income taxes 
in the first fiscal quarter of  we combined the operating results of the former component technologies and portfolio technologies segments and included the combined operating results in the advanced devices segment

table of contents research and development expenses increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the inclusion of expenses from acquisitions not applicable in the prior year in the amount of million and increase in compensation of million 
overall research and development spending remained relatively constant at approximately of revenues 
we expect to continue to devote resources to the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products

this was partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of million 
other operating expenses restructuring charges there were no restructuring charges recorded in fiscal restructuring charges of million  and million were recorded in fiscal years and respectively 
the charges in fiscal were primarily related to office closure costs due to integration efforts of the mensi acquisition 
the charges in fiscal were primarily related to severance costs due to the realignment of trimble mobile solutions inc as a result of the realignment  the headcount decreased by in fiscal as of december   an accrual balance of million  related to the fiscal office closure  is expected to be paid over the next several years 
in process research and development we recorded in process research and development ipr d expense of million and million related to acquisitions made in fiscal and respectively 
we did not record any ipr d expense in fiscal at the date of each acquisition  the projects associated with the ipr d efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
the value of the ipr d was determined using a discounted cash flow model similar to the income approach  focusing on the income producing capabilities of the in process technologies 
accordingly  the value assigned to these ipr d amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 

table of contents amortization of purchased and other intangible assets fiscal years ended december  december  december  in thousands amortization of purchased intangibles included in cost of sales amortization of purchased intangibles included in operating expenses amortization of other intangible assets total amortization of purchased and other intangible assets total amortization expense of purchased and other intangible assets was million in fiscal  of which million was recorded in cost of sales and million was recorded in operating expenses 
total amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented of revenue in fiscal  an increase of million from fiscal when it represented of revenue 
the increase was primarily due to the acquisition of certain technology and patent intangibles as a result of acquisitions made in fiscal as well as fiscal acquisition intangibles that included a full year of amortization expense in fiscal  but only partial year amortization expense in fiscal due to the timing of the acquisitions 
amortization expense of purchased and other intangibles represented of revenue in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal when it represented of revenue

in addition  expenses for affiliated operations  net increased by million due a million increase in income from affiliated operations and the absence of million of net transfer pricing expense with ctct that was included in fiscal  but is now included in operating income  partially offset by the recognition of a one time deferred gain on the ctct joint venture of million in fiscal non operating expense  net decreased by million during fiscal as compared with fiscal primarily due to a decrease in net interest expense of million as a result of the repayment of debt and interest earned on higher cash balances offset by a million write off of debt issuance costs relating to the credit facility  an increase of million in foreign currency transaction gain and a million decrease in expenses for affiliated operations as a result of increased profits from our joint ventures and recognition of the remaining deferred gain from the caterpillar joint venture 
this was partially offset by a decrease in other income primarily due to the absence of a non recurring gain in investments of approximately million in fiscal year 
table of contents income tax provision our effective income tax rate for fiscal years  and was  and respectively 
the rate was less that the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to operations in foreign jurisdictions subject to an effective tax rate lower than the us and extraterritorial income exclusion eti deduction 
the income tax rate was less that the us federal statutory rate  primarily due to the benefit from the repatriation of undistributed foreign subsidiary earnings provided by the american jobs creation act of the income tax rate was less than the federal statutory rate primarily due to the realization of benefits from net operating losses and other previously reserved deferred tax assets 
litigation matters from time to time  we are involved in litigation arising out of the ordinary course of our business 
there are no known claims or pending litigation that are expected to have a material effect on our overall financial position  results of operations  or liquidity

our accounts receivable days of sales outstanding improved to days at the end of fiscal  from days at the end of fiscal the decrease is primarily due to increased collection efforts and improvement in monitoring of outstanding receivables 
in addition  in the first quarter of  the company established a dealer floor plan financing program in the us and canada through a non recourse financing facility
