overview the company is engaged in the research  development  manufacture and marketing of biotechnology based products for the human pharmaceutical market  and also manufactures bulk pharmaceutical intermediates for the worldwide veterinary pharmaceutical industry 
the company conducts its business operations through its subsidiaries dextran products and chemdex 
dextran products business the manufacture and sale of bulk quantities of dextran and derivative products for sale to large pharmaceutical companies throughout the world is conducted through a canadian subsidiary  dextran products 
in fiscal year  management intends to continue its focus on the core business of dextran products that have historically been the backbone of the company 
opportunities to increase distribution chains for existing dextran products in certain overseas markets  such as india  china and russia  are being explored by management 
new customers have also been identified in europe 
expanding current market opportunities and the potential for new market penetration has led management to make plant refurbishments and the expansion of production capacity a priority for fiscal year with respect to dextran products operations 
the first step has been installation of new drying equipment to produce increased quantities of higher quality product 
these products have traditionally generated higher margins 
research and development of the company s human pharmaceutical products is also coordinated at the dextran products facility 
ushercell  is a high molecular weight cellulose sulphate that was envisioned for topical vaginal use primarily in the prevention of unplanned pregnancies  as well as the transmission of aids and other sexually transmitted diseases 
on january   the company announced that trials  originally intended to evaluate various aspects of the use of cellulose sulphate as a contraceptive gel with antiviral capabilities  were being halted due to a possible increase in transmission of hiv 
announcements were prepared and distributed in conjunction with conrad and other agencies which were involved with the trials 
a full investigation is now underway as to the potential cause and to determine exactly what occurred 
the final report is expected towards the end of fiscal year until the report is available  it is impossible to plan future developments of this product for any of the indications that have been identified to date 
the company never received any financial gain from this project  and as a result  there is no immediate or direct effect on sales or revenues 
chemdex  vet labs and the joint venture business during approximately one month of the fiscal year  the company also engaged in the finished product veterinary pharmaceutical business through its united states subsidiary chemdex  which  in turn  conducted its operations through its subsidiary  vet labs 
on december   vet labs and sparhawk laboratories inc entered into a joint venture for the purpose of manufacturing and selling veterinary pharmaceutical products 
on january   the company  chemdex and vet labs entered into an asset purchase agreement with sparhawk pursuant to which the company agreed to sell its finished product veterinary pharmaceutical business  including substantially all of the assets of vet labs and its ownership interest in the joint venture  to sparhawk for  in cash 
the sale was completed on march  simultaneously with the closing  chemdex advanced  to sparhawk in exchange for an unsecured subordinated promissory note bearing interest at per annum and a warrant to purchase of the equity of sparhawk 
the promissory note was payable in full on march  interest was payable annually  but could be deferred and added to the principal balance of the promissory note each year at sparhawk s discretion 
on may   payment in full for principal and interest was received 
the warrant expired at the earlier of payment in full of the promissory note or march   and therefore expired before it could be exercised 
chemdex also entered into a supply agreement with sparhawk to supply ferric hydroxide and hydrogenated dextran solution to sparhawk on an exclusive basis in the united states for years 
management considered the finished goods veterinary pharmaceuticals industry to be a highly competitive  mature industry  and believed that meaningful growth in this industry would require significant investment in new product development 
the company s investment in this industry through the joint venture required the sharing of profits with its partner 
management believed that the company could expect to obtain a higher return on investment by focusing on its current dextran products business and on human pharmaceutical research and development projects 
the sale of this business segment resulted in a significant reduction in consolidated sales and gross profits during fiscal year results of operations fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  compared to fiscal year ended january  fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease net income loss before taxes net income loss earnings loss per share the improvement in net loss for the fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is due to several factors  including the increase in sales and gross margins  the decrease in expenses  and the recognition of the deferred gain on the promissory note related to the sale of the veterinary products assets to sparhawk note 
these gains were partially offset by the poor margins in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the continued increase in value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  which negatively affected gross margins at dextran products  because the majority of its revenue is denominated in united states dollars while the majority of its cost of sales is denominated in canadian dollars 
therefore  when the value of the canadian dollar increases in relation to the united states dollar  margins decrease 
the fiscal year net loss is primarily due to the decrease in gross margin at dextran products  which was primarily a result of the continued increase in value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar  as well as increased research and development costs 
the united states dollar continued to decline in value relative to the canadian dollar during fiscal year exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a decrease in margins at dextran products in fiscal year compared to the previous fiscal year decrease in fiscal year compared to fiscal 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease sales sales increased in fiscal year primarily as a result of increased demand from existing customers  accompanied by price increases that were implemented in the third quarter 
total production in fiscal increased by compared to fiscal the decrease in sales during fiscal year is due primarily to the fact that the fiscal year included one month of sales in the vet labs joint venture  while fiscal year only includes raw materials sales to sparhawk 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease gross profit percentage of sales the increase in gross profit in fiscal year is a result of the increase in sales due to price increases and customer demand noted above  combined with ongoing control of direct costs by management 
management continues to be concerned about the increasing cost and utilization of utilities  and is hopeful that cost savings will result from the new equipment being implemented as part of the plant refurbishment 
overall margins were negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of fiscal due to unusually large sales of lower margin products to some major customers  combined with unexpected increases in equipment repairs and utility costs 
the decline in gross profit in fiscal year resulted from the increased cost of sales  which was exacerbated by the continued increase in value of the canadian dollar compared to the united states dollar 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease selling  promotion  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year  management continued its efforts to reduce overall selling  promotion and general and administrative expenses 
while cost reductions were realized in the majority of general and administrative areas  the most notable reductions occurred in outside professional and reporting fees  insurance  and directors expenses  though options expense was higher than in fiscal offsetting these cost savings was an increase in selling and promotion expenses 
during fiscal  the company attended several functions relating to the cellulose sulphate project 
missions to microbicides in south africa as well as visits to india to source production partners were also undertaken 
some sponsorship was funded at microbicides as well as at the large toronto aids conference during the summer 
the company expects a significant reduction in these costs for fiscal in fiscal year  overall selling  promotion and general and administrative expenses remained consistent with fiscal year during fiscal year  administrative expenses decreased slightly for dextran products  although this was offset by the continuing rise in the canadian dollar 
general and administrative expenses for chemdex decreased in fiscal year due primarily to the one month of operations included in fiscal year fiscal years research and development fy fy fy v v increase decrease research and development expenditures investment tax credits net research and development expense in fiscal year  the company s research and development expenditures were consistent with the level of expenditures in fiscal year in fiscal year  the majority of expenses were relatively evenly split between patent work  and consultants working on production process improvements  with some funds allocated to the bacterial vaginosis trial 
almost all work has been halted on the project since the independent review board overseeing the phase iii clinical trials discovered some inconsistent results and halted those trials 
it is expected that their report will be available later this year at which point a decision can be made on further activities 
therefore for fiscal year  it is expected that research and development expenditures will be reduced 
in fiscal years and  the majority of expenses related to the clinical trial on bacterial vaginosis 
funding for the company s primary development products is provided directly by third party public and or private sector groups to the entities carrying out such research 
the company does not take possession or control over these funds 
the company benefits from the results of research projects through the ownership of patents and or licenses with respect to the products involved 
the company has no commitments to repay the funding or to purchase the results of the research 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease depreciation and amortization expense the increase in depreciation and amortization in fiscal year and is due primarily to the increased investments in capital equipment during the year  and the increase in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar 
included in the depreciation and amortization expense above are allocations to cost of goods sold in the amount of  for fiscal year  fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease interest expense the increase in interest expense in fiscal year is primarily attributable to the interest on the capital equipment loan obtained in march  as well as the rise in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar 
this is partially offset by the decrease in other long term debt and capital lease obligations 
in fiscal year  the decrease in interest expense relative to the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to a decrease in long term debt and capital lease obligations  as well as the associated decrease in imputed interest due to the continuing repayment of non interest bearing long term debt 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease foreign exchange gain in fiscal year  the increase in the foreign exchange gain was due primarily to dextran products fluctuating exposure to the united states dollar throughout the fiscal year  combined with the continued increase in value of the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar 
dextran products also realized a foreign exchange gain in fiscal year because the canadian dollar increased in value relative to the united states dollar 
throughout fiscal years and  dextran products generally had a net liability exposure to the united states dollar because intercompany payables denominated in united states dollars normally exceeded its united states dollar denominated accounts receivable balances 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease interest and other income the increase in interest and other income in fiscal year is due primarily to the recognition of the deferred gain of  on the promissory note from sparhawk as explained above  as well as investment gains during the year 
in fiscal year  the company earned interest income of  from the investment of the proceeds from the sale of vet labs assets 
fiscal years fy fy fy v v increase decrease tax provision recovery the fiscal year decrease in tax provision is due to a decrease in deferred tax liabilities of  combined with a reduction in the current tax liability of  the decrease in the deferred tax liability is due to the decrease in the timing difference related to the excess of carrying value of depreciable assets over tax value  which in turn reduces future income tax liabilities 
the decrease in the current tax liability is necessary because no tax liabilities are expected 
the fiscal year decrease in tax provision was a result of the valuation allowance taken against deferred tax assets due to the degree of uncertainty relating to the future recoverability of tax losses and unused research and development expenditures incurred by the company 
the company also incurred united states non resident tax on interest payments made from chemdex to polydex 
there was also a tax recovery due to a reduction in the valuation allowance on a deferred tax item realized during the year at chemdex during fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of january   the company had cash and cash equivalents of  compared to  at january  in fiscal year  the company generated cash of  in its operating activities  compared to expending  for fiscal year and  for fiscal year the decrease in cash generated from operations in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is because of the decrease in earnings 
depreciation and amortization continues to be a large non cash expense of the company  which is expected to increase in fiscal as result of assets acquired as part of the refurbishment become operational 
working capital improved to  but the current ratio declined to to as of january   compared to  and to as of january  management expects the primary source of its future capital needs will be a combination of existing cash and cash equivalent reserves generated from the sale of the vet labs assets  company earnings and borrowings 
as at january   the company had commitments of  for capital expenditures related to the plant refurbishment at dextran products in toronto  and  for other commitments 
the company believes that based upon the current levels of revenues and spending  its existing working capital resources will be sufficient to support continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
at january   the company had accounts receivable of  and inventory of  compared to  and  respectively  at january  the increase in accounts receivable at january  is due to the timing of payments and the large volume of sales in the fourth quarter compared to fiscal at january   the company had accounts payable of  compared to  at january  the increase as at january  was due primarily to the timing of supplier payments as well as costs related to the plant refurbishment in the fourth quarter 
during fiscal year  capital expenditures totaled  as compared to  in fiscal year the majority of the capital expenditures were for production equipment at the dextran products plant in toronto in both these fiscal years 
management intends to complete its current plant refurbishment and expansion plan in the second quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  the company continued to decrease its investment in medium term  investment grade  debt securities  while maintaining investments in fixed income mutual funds  and diversified royalty and income trust units  all denominated in canadian dollars 
the remaining medium term debt security has a maturity of june  unrealized gains and losses will occur as the market interest rate varies 
management does not expect significant gains or losses in the future due to the relatively short term to maturity of the debt and the nature of the trust unit and mutual funds 
management plans to hold this debt to maturity unless such funds are needed for working capital or other cash needs such as the plant refurbishments 
the change in accumulated other comprehensive income of the company is almost entirely attributable to the currency translation adjustment of dextran products 
dextran products functional currency is the canadian dollar 
this currency translation adjustment arises from the translation of dextran products financial statements to united states dollars 
dextran products has a cdn 
 us  cdn 
 us  line of credit  of which none was utilized at january  and this line of credit bears interest at the canadian banks prime lending rate plus  and is repayable on demand 
this indebtedness is collateralized by a general security agreement over the company s assets and a collateral mortgage of cdn 
 on the dextran products building in toronto 
in march of  the company secured an additional cdn  fixed rate term loan primarily to fund capital purchases  with interest at over canadian banks prime lending rate 
the decrease in capital lease obligations during fiscal year was due to repayments on capital leases 
the majority of the capital lease obligations were repaid during fiscal year the company entered into one new capital lease obligation at dextran products during fiscal year  for a piece of office equipment 
capital lease obligations are due over the next three years 
no changes in accounting principles or their application have been implemented in the reporting period that would have a material effect on reported income 
changes in the relative values of the canadian dollar and the united states dollar occur from time to time and may  in certain instances  materially affect the company s results of operations 
the company does not believe that the impact of inflation and changing prices has had a material effect on its operations or financial results at any time in the last three years

critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  applied on a consistent basis 
the critical accounting policies include the use of estimates of allowance for doubtful accounts  the useful lives of assets and the realizability of deferred tax assets 
the company s accounting policies with respect to the joint venture and its disposition are also discussed below 
management is required to make estimates and assumptions  in preparing the consolidated financial statements  that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods 
the actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates made by management include the calculation of reserves for uncollectible accounts  inventory allowances  useful lives of long lived assets and the realizability of deferred tax assets 
revenue recognition all revenue is from sales of bulk and finished dosage manufactured products and is recognized when title and risk of ownership of products pass to the customer 
title and risk of ownership pass to the customer pursuant to the applicable sales contract  either upon shipment of product or upon receipt by the customer 
since returns are rare and generally not accepted  management has not made provision for returns 
in addition  product sold in bulk quantities is tested  prior to release for shipment  to ensure that it meets customer specifications  and in many cases  customers receive samples for their own testing 
approval is obtained from the customer prior to shipping 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable is stated net of allowances for doubtful accounts 
allowances for doubtful accounts are determined by each reporting unit on a specific item basis 
management reviews the credit worthiness of individual customers and past payment history to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
since the majority of sales at dextran products are export  dextran products maintains credit insurance through a crown corporation  which is supported by the canadian government  for the majority of its customers receivables 
there has been no allowance for doubtful accounts during the past three years 
long lived assets long lived assets are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation or amortization computed using the straight line method based on their estimated useful lives ranging from three to fifteen years 
useful life is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute to the company s cash flows 
a significant change in estimated useful lives could have a material impact on the results of operations 
the company reviews the recoverability of its long lived assets  including buildings  equipment and other intangible assets  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based on the company s ability to recover the carrying value of the asset from the expected future pre tax cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges of the related operations 
if these cash flows are less than the carrying value of such asset  an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between estimated fair value and carrying value 
the measurement of impairment requires management to make estimates of these cash flows related to long lived assets as well as other fair value determinations 
deferred tax assets the company has recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets where there is uncertainty as to the ultimate realization of the future tax deduction 
dextran products has incurred capital losses  which are only deductible against capital gains 
it is not certain that dextran products will realize capital gains in the future to use these canadian capital loss deductions

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk exchange rate sensitivity the company s operations consist of manufacturing activities in canada 
the company s products are sold in north america  europe and the pacific rim 
while the majority of the sales of dextran products  the company s canadian operation  are denominated in united states dollars  the majority of its expenses are incurred in canadian dollars 
the majority of the assets and liabilities of dextran products are denominated in canadian dollars prior to the currency translation adjustment necessary for preparation of the financial statements of the company contained in this report 
when the canadian dollar rises in value relative to the united states dollar  the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of dextran products as stated in united states dollars increases 
a rise in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar also results in a decrease in gross margins and net income of dextran products 
dextran products also experiences a foreign exchange gain when the canadian dollar rises in relation to the united states dollar because it has a net liability exposure to the united states dollar resulting from a united states dollar denominated intercompany loan 
similarly  a decline in the canadian dollar relative to the united states dollar results in a foreign exchange loss and increased gross margins and net income at dextran products 
management monitors currency fluctuations to ensure that an acceptable margin level at dextran products is maintained 
management has the ability  to some extent  to adjust sales prices to maintain an acceptable margin level
