in estimating the allowance  management considers factors such as current overall economic conditions  industry specific economic conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance  historical experience with write offs and the level of past due amounts 
changes in these conditions may result in additional allowances 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was  at june  and  at july  inventory the company maintains an allowance for estimated obsolete or unmarketable inventory based on the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
in estimating the allowance  management considers factors such as excess or slow moving inventories  product expiration dating  products on quality hold  current and future customer demand and market conditions

the company has established valuation allowances against a portion of the non us net operating losses and state related net operating losses to reflect the uncertainty of its ability to fully utilize these benefits given the limited carryforward periods permitted by the various jurisdictions 
the evaluation of the realizability of the company s net operating losses requires the use of considerable management judgment to estimate the future taxable income for the various jurisdictions  for which the ultimate amounts and timing of such realization may differ 
the valuation allowance can also be impacted by changes in the tax regulations 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s contingent tax liabilities

goodwill goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
the estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the judgments required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
changes in these estimates may result in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the goodwill related to the agis acquisition has been allocated to the api and rx pharmaceuticals segments and is tested for impairment annually in the third quarter of the fiscal year 
the current year testing resulted in no impairment charge related to the api and rx pharmaceuticals segments 
the company s api business is heavily dependent on new products currently under development

goodwill was  at june  and  at july  other intangible assets other intangible assets subject to amortization consist of developed product technology  distribution and license agreements  customer relationships and trademarks 
most of these assets are related to the acquisition of agis and are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives using the straight line method 
an accelerated method of amortization is used for customer relationships 
for intangible assets subject to amortization  an impairment analysis is performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and its carrying amount exceeds its fair value
