item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents further  we expect to incur incremental additional costs to support our future operations  including further commercialization of our products and development of new test methods to allow us to further penetrate the human diagnostic market and the veterinary diagnostic market  our need to acquire capital equipment for our manufacturing facilities  which includes the ongoing costs related to the continuing development of our current and future products  research and design costs related to the continuing development of our current and future products  and additional pre clinical testing and clinical trials for our current and future products 
to the extent that our existing resources and anticipated revenue from the sale of our products are insufficient to fund our activities or if we are unable to meet the financial covenants of our line of credit  we may have to raise additional funds from the issuance of public or private securities 
in the event that we cannot maintain compliance with these financial covenants  we may also be subject to increased interest rate expenses 
we may not be able to raise additional funding  or if we are able to  we may not be able to raise funding on acceptable terms 
we may also dilute then existing shareholders if we raise additional funds by issuing new equity securities 
alternately  we may have to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  products and or sales territories if we are required to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners 
if we are unable to raise needed funds  we may be required to curtail our operations significantly 
this would materially adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
we may not be able to compete effectively with larger  better established entities or their products  or with future organizations or future products  which could cause our sales to decline 
blood analysis is a well established field in which there are a number of competitors that have substantially greater financial resources and larger  more established marketing  sales and service organizations than we do 
we compete with the following organizations commercial clinical laboratories  hospitals clinical laboratories  and manufacturers of bench top multi test blood analyzers and other testing systems that health care providers can use on site 
historically  hospitals and commercial laboratories performed most human diagnostic testing  and commercial laboratories performed most veterinary medical testing 
we have identified five principal factors that customers typically use to evaluate our products and those of our competitors 
these factors are range of tests offered  the immediacy of results  cost effectiveness  ease of use  and reliability of results 
we believe that we compete effectively on each of these factors except for the range of tests offered 
clinical laboratories are effective at processing large panels of tests using skilled technicians and complex equipment 
while our current offering of reagent discs cannot provide the same broad range of tests  we believe that in certain markets our products provide a sufficient breadth of test menus to compete successfully with clinical laboratories given the advantages of our products with respect to the other four factors 
however  we cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to compete effectively on cost effectiveness  ease of use  immediacy of results or reliability of results 
we also cannot assure you that we will ever be able to compete effectively on the basis of range of tests offered 

table of contents competition in the human and veterinary diagnostic markets is intense 
our principal competitors in the human diagnostic market are alfa wassermann spa  i stat corporation which was purchased by abbott laboratories  johnson johnson including its subsidiary  ortho clinical diagnostics  inc and polymedco 
our principal competitors in the veterinary diagnostic market are idexx laboratories  inc and heska corporation 
most of our competitors have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do 
in particular  many of our competitors have large sales forces and well established distribution channels 
consequently  we must develop our distribution channels and improve our direct sales force in order to compete in these markets 
changes in third party payor reimbursement regulations can negatively affect our business 
by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement they will provide for blood testing services  third party payors  such as hmos  pay per service insurance plans  medicare and medicaid  can indirectly affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our human testing products 
for example  the centers for medicare and medicaid services the cms set the level of reimbursement of fees for blood testing services for medicare beneficiaries 
if third party payors decrease the reimbursement amounts for blood testing services  it may decrease the amount that physicians and hospitals are able to charge patients for such services 
consequently  we will need to charge less for our products 
if the government and third party payors do not provide for adequate coverage and reimbursement levels to allow health care providers to use our products  the demand for our products will decrease 
we are subject to numerous governmental regulations and any regulatory changes are difficult to predict and may be damaging to our business 
need for fda certification for our medical device products our piccolo products are regulated under the medical device amendments to the food  drug and cosmetic act  which is administered by the fda 
the fda has classified our piccolo products as class i and class ii devices 
these classifications require us to submit to the fda a pre market notification form or k 
the fda uses the k to substantiate product claims that are made by medical device manufacturers prior to marketing 
in our k notification  we must  among other things  establish that the product we plan to market is substantially equivalent to a product that was on the market prior to the adoption of the medical device amendment or a product that the fda has previously cleared under the k process 
the fda review process of a k notification can last anywhere from three to six months  and the fda must issue a written order finding substantial equivalence before a company can market a medical device 
as of march   we have received market clearance from the fda for our piccolo system and reagent tests that we have on reagent discs 
we are currently developing additional tests that the fda will have to clear through the k notification procedures 
these new test products are crucial for our success in the human medical market 
if we do not receive k clearance for a particular product  we will not be able to sell that product in the united states 
need to comply with manufacturing regulations the medical device amendment also requires us to manufacture our piccolo products in accordance with good manufacturing practices guidelines 
current good manufacturing practice requirements are set forth in the cfr quality system regulation 
these requirements regulate the methods used in  and the facilities and controls used for the design  manufacture  packaging  storage  installation and servicing of our medical devices intended for human use 
our manufacturing facility is subject to periodic inspections 
although we have obtained a license from the state of california to manufacture our products  various state regulatory agencies may regulate the manufacture of our products 
to date  we have complied with the following in april  the state of california food and drug branch granted our manufacturing facility in compliance status  based on the regulations for good manufacturing practices for medical devices 
in may  the state of california food and drug branch granted licensing for our manufacturing facility in union city  california 
in may  we received our iso certification  expanding our compliance with international quality standards 
in december  we received iso quality system certification as required by the european in vitro device directive 
this certified our quality system specifically to medical devices 

table of contents in both september and march  the fda conducted a facility inspection and verified our compliance with the cfr regulation 
in october  we received our recertification to the iso quality system standard for medical devices 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully pass a re inspection by the fda or the state of california 
in addition  we cannot assure you that we can comply with all current or future government manufacturing requirements and regulations 
if we are unable to comply with the regulations  or if we do not pass routine inspections  our business and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
effects of the clinical laboratory improvement amendments on our products our piccolo products are also affected by the clinical laboratory improvement amendments the clia of the clia are intended to insure the quality and reliability of all medical testing in the united states regardless of where tests are performed 
the current clia regulations divide laboratory tests into three categories waived  moderately complex and highly complex 
many of the tests performed using the piccolo system are in the moderately complex category 
this category requires that any location in which testing is performed be certified as a laboratory 
hence  we can only sell some piccolo products to customers who meet the standards of a laboratory 
to receive laboratory certification  a testing facility must be certified by the cms 
after the testing facility receives a laboratory certification  it must then meet the clia regulations 
because we can only sell some piccolo products to testing facilities that are certified laboratories  the market for some products is correspondingly constrained 
during fiscal  the fda granted waived status under clia regulations for the following analytes when used in conjunction with the piccolo chemistry analyzer for the medical market in march  the fda granted waived status under clia regulations for the following analytes calcium ca  creatinine cre  urea nitrogen bun and uric acid ua 
in october  the fda granted waived status under clia regulations for the following analytes albumin alb  alkaline phosphatase alp  amylase amy  gamma glutamyltransferase ggt  total bilirubin tbil and total protein tp 
prior to fiscal  the fda granted waived status under clia regulations for our total cholesterol chol  high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl  triglycerides trig  glucose glu  alanine aminotransferase alt and aspartate aminotransferase ast tests when used in conjunction with our piccolo system 
accordingly  we can offer the following piccolo reagent discs as waived tests to the medical market general chemistry  general chemistry  the lipid panel  the lipid panel plus and the liver panel plus 
waived status permits untrained personnel to run the piccolo system using the general chemistry  general chemistry  the lipid panel  the lipid panel plus and the liver panel plus  thus  extending the sites doctors offices and other point of care environments that can use the piccolo system 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully receive clia waived status from the fda for other products 
consequently  for the reagent discs that have not received clia waived status  the market for our piccolo products may be confined to those testing facilities that are certified as laboratories and our growth can be limited accordingly 
however  we are engaged in an active program to test and apply for clia waivers for additional analytes 
we are subject to various federal  state  local  and international regulations federal  state  local and international regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of health care products and diagnostic devices may change 
in addition  as we continue to sell in foreign markets  we may have to obtain additional governmental clearances in those markets 
foreign certifications that we have received include the following  among others in december  we received certification from the british standards institute to the iso quality system standard for medical devices 
this quality system certification  along with successful completion of product testing to european standards and the translation of piccolo product documentation into the required languages  enabled us to meet the compliance requirements of the ce mark and the european in vitro device directive 
in september  we received the canadian medical device conformity assessment system stamp on our iso certificate to signify compliance with health canada regulations 

table of contents in march  we received our certification to the version of the iso quality system standard for medical devices 
additionally  we have received registration from t v s d japan ltd 
for our bile acid assay in japan in july for our new products  the vetscan vs and piccolo xpress  we have also received approval from the ministry of agriculture in japan to market and sell these blood chemistry analyzers in japan 
we cannot predict what impact  if any  such current or future regulatory changes would have on our business 
we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearances for our products in the united states or in foreign markets  and the failure to obtain these regulatory clearances will materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
although we believe that we will be able to comply with all applicable regulations of the fda and of the state of california  including the quality system regulation  current regulations depend on administrative interpretations 
future interpretations made by the fda  cms or other regulatory bodies may adversely affect our business 
we depend on key members of our management and scientific staff  and we must retain and recruit qualified individuals if we are to be competitive or our ability to execute our business strategy and generate sales could be harmed 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
the loss of any of these key personnel  including in particular clinton h 
severson  our president  chief executive officer and chairman of our board of directors  might impede the achievement of our business objectives 
mr 
severson s amended and restated employment agreement with us has been filed with the securities and exchange commission as an exhibit 
we currently do not maintain key man life insurance on any of our employees 
although historically we have been relatively successful both in retaining our current management and scientific staff  as well as attracting and retaining skilled and experienced marketing  sales and manufacturing personnel  we may not be able to employ such personnel on acceptable terms in the future because numerous medical products and other high technology companies compete for the services of these qualified individuals 
standards for compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of are complex  and if we are unable to maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting  our business could be harmed and our stock price could decline 
rules adopted by the securities and exchange commission pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of require an annual assessment of internal control over financial reporting by our management and an attestation of its assessment by an independent registered public accounting firm 
the standards that must be met for management to assess the internal control over financial reporting as effective are new and complex  require significant documentation  testing and possible remediation to meet the detailed standards 
our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of our fiscal years ended march  and although we received an unqualified opinion on our financial statements for the fiscal years ended march  and  and on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of march  and  the steps we have taken to date and the steps we are still in the process of taking to improve the reliability of our financial statements in the future are subject to continued management review  as well as oversight by the audit committee of our board of directors 
the assessment for our fiscal year ended march  identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting related to ineffective controls over the determination and reporting of the provision for income taxes 
the control deficiency identified in fiscal could have resulted in a future material misstatement of our income tax provision and related balance sheet accounts that would not have been prevented or detected by management 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in implementation could harm operating results or prevent us from accurately reporting financial results or cause a failure to meet our reporting obligations in the future 
if our management cannot assess our internal control over financial reporting as effective  or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on such assessment  investor confidence and our share value may be negatively impacted 
our operating results could be materially affected by unanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities 
our determination of our tax liability like any company s determination of its tax liability is subject to review by applicable tax authorities 
any adverse outcome of such a review could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  the determination of our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment including our determination of whether a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets is required 
although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable  the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made 

table of contents we must comply with strict and potentially costly environmental regulations or we could pay significant fines 
we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies that govern the use  generation  manufacture  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
in particular  we are subject to laws  rules and regulations governing the handling and disposal of biohazardous materials used in the development and testing of our products 
we handle and dispose of human and veterinary blood samples for testing whole blood  plasma  serum  which cost approximately  in fiscal to comply with applicable environmental regulations 
although we believe that we have complied with applicable laws and regulations in all material respects and have not been required to take any action to correct any noncompliance  we may have to incur significant costs to comply with environmental regulations if our manufacturing to commercial levels continues to increase 
in addition  if a government agency determines that we have not complied with these laws  rules and regulations  we may have to pay significant fines and or take remedial action that would be expensive and we do not carry environmental related insurance coverage 
our facilities and manufacturing operations are vulnerable to natural disasters and other unexpected losses  system failures or delays may harm our business 
our success depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our manufacturing operations  which are co located with our corporate headquarters in union city  california 
a failure of manufacturing operations  be it in the development and manufacturing of our piccolo or vetscan blood chemistry analyzers or the reagent discs used in the blood chemistry analyzers  could result in our inability to supply customer demand 
we do not have a backup facility to provide redundant manufacturing capacity in the event of a system failure 
accordingly  if our location in union city  california experienced a system failure  or regulatory problem that temporarily shut down our manufacturing facility  our manufacturing ability would become unavailable until we were able to bring an alternative facility online  a process which could take several weeks or even months 
these manufacturing operations are also vulnerable to damage from earthquakes  fire  floods  power loss  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
although we carry property and business interruption insurance  our coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur 
additionally  our computer servers may be vulnerable to computer viruses  physical or electronic break ins and similar disruptions 
fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and the possible lack of financial stability in foreign countries could prevent overseas sales growth 
our international sales are currently overwhelmingly us dollar denominated 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
for the limited amount of our sales denominated in local currencies  we are subject to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the particular local currency 
our operating results could also be adversely affected by the seasonality of international sales and the economic conditions of our overseas markets 
our stock price is highly volatile and investing in our stock involves a high degree of risk  which could result in substantial losses for investors 
the market price of our common stock  like the securities of many other medical products companies  fluctuates over a wide range  and will continue to be highly volatile in the future 
during fiscal  the closing sale prices of our common stock on the nasdaq ranged from to per share and the closing sale price on march   the last day of trading for our fiscal year ended march   was per share 
during the last eight fiscal quarters ended march   our stock price closed at a high of on april  and a low of on april  the following factors may affect the market price of our common stock fluctuation in our operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  changes in governmental regulation  prospects and proposals for health care reform  
table of contents governmental or third party payors controls on prices that our customers may pay for our products  developments or disputes concerning patent or our other proprietary rights  public concern as to the safety of our devices or similar devices developed by our competitors  and general market conditions 
because our stock price is so volatile  investing in our common stock is highly risky 
a potential investor must be able to withstand the loss of his entire investment in our common stock 
our shareholders rights plan and our ability to issue preferred stock may delay or prevent a change of control of abaxis 
our shareholder rights plan  adopted by our board of directors on april   may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or discourage a third party from attempting to acquire control of abaxis 
the shareholder rights plan could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
in addition  our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the shareholders  except to the extent required by nasdaq rules 
the issuance of preferred stock  while providing flexibility in connection with possible financings or acquisitions or other corporate purposes  could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock

business overview abaxis  inc abaxis  us  or we develops  manufactures and markets portable blood analysis systems for use in any veterinary or human patient care setting to provide clinicians with rapid blood constituent measurements 
our primary product is a blood analysis system  consisting of a compact portable analyzer and a series of single use plastic discs  called reagent discs  containing all the chemicals required to perform a panel of up to tests on veterinary patients and tests on human patients 
we manufacture the system in our manufacturing facilities in union city  california and we market our blood chemistry analyzers in both the medical market and in the veterinary market  as described below 
medical market we currently market the system in the medical market under the name piccolo xpress 
through october  we marketed the blood analysis system in the medical market as the piccolo  now referred to as the piccolo classic 
we continue to support and service our current population of piccolo xpress and piccolo classic chemistry analyzers 
veterinary market we currently market the system in the veterinary market under the name vetscan vs 
through march  we marketed the blood analysis system in the veterinary market as the vetscan  now referred to as the vetscan classic 
we continue to support and service our current population of vetscan vs and vetscan classic chemistry analyzers 

table of contents we also market a veterinary hematology instrument that offers an parameter complete blood count cbc analysis  including a three part white blood cell differential for the diagnostic assessment of patients by the veterinarian in their clinic 
this hematology instrument was introduced in may as the vetscan hmii  and is now referred to as the vetscan hm 
we currently purchase the hematology instruments from diatron mi kft 
of budapest  hungary 
through april  we marketed a veterinary hematology instrument under the name vetscan hmt 
we continue to support and service our current population of vetscan hmt  vetscan hmii and vetscan hm hematology instruments 
sales for any future periods are not predictable with a significant degree of certainty 
we generally operate with a limited order backlog because our products are typically shipped shortly after orders are received 
as a result  product sales in any quarter are generally dependent on orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
our expense levels  which are to a large extent fixed  are based in part on our expectations of future revenues 
accordingly  we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
as a result  any such shortfall would negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
our sales may be adversely impacted by pricing pressure from competitors 
our ability to be consistently profitable will depend  in part  on our ability to increase the sales volumes of our vetscan and piccolo products and to successfully compete with other competitors 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful indicators of future results 
critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and the sensitivity of these estimates to deviations in the assumptions used in making them 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  there can be no assurance that our actual results will not differ from these estimates 
we have identified the policies below as critical because they are not only important to understanding our financial condition and results of operations  but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
accordingly  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed below 
for a more detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see the notes to financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition and deferred revenue 
our primary customers are distributors and direct customers in both the medical and veterinary markets 
revenues from product sales  net of estimated sales allowances and rebates  are recognized when i evidence of an arrangement exists  ii upon shipment of the products to the customer  iii the sales price is fixed or determinable and iv collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
rights of return are not provided 
we recognize revenue associated with extended maintenance agreements ratably over the life of the contract 
amounts collected in advance of revenue recognition are recorded as a current or non current liability based on the time from the balance sheet date to the future date of revenue recognition 
we also provide incentives in the form of free goods or extended maintenance agreements to customers in connection with the sale of our instruments 
revenue from such sales is allocated separately to the instruments and incentives based on the relative fair value of each element 
revenue allocated to incentives is deferred until the goods are shipped to the customer or is recognized ratably over the life of the maintenance contract 
at march   and  the current portion of deferred revenue balances were   and  respectively  and the non current portion of deferred revenue balances were   and  respectively 
the fluctuation in balances is due to the types of customer incentives programs offered during the period  depends on when the free goods are shipped to the customer and the maintenance period of the maintenance agreements 
we periodically offer trade in programs to customers for trading in an existing instrument to purchase a new instrument and we will either provide incentives in the form of free goods or reduce the sales price of the instrument 
these incentives in the form of free goods are recorded according to the policies described above 
distributor and customer rebates 
we offer distributor pricing rebates and customer incentives from time to time 
the distributor pricing rebates are offered to distributors upon meeting the sales volume requirements during a qualifying period 

table of contents the distributor pricing rebates are recorded as a reduction to gross revenue during the qualifying period 
cash rebates are offered to customers who purchase specific instruments during a promotional period 
the cash rebate is recorded as a reduction to gross revenue 
the distributor pricing rebate program  which started in fiscal  is offered to distributors in the north america veterinary market  upon meeting the sales volume requirements of reagent discs during the qualifying period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of products sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and which rebate percentage applies 
based on these factors and using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability as a reduction to gross revenue when we record the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from one to six months after sale 
at march   and  the accrual balances related to distributor pricing rebates were   and  respectively 
the increase in the rebate accrual at march   as compared to march   was due to distributors not meeting the purchase requirements in the fourth quarter of fiscal rebate programs offered to customers vary from period to period in the medical and veterinary markets 
generally  the customer rebate program relates to the sale of certain products or instruments during a specified promotional period 
as part of the rebate program  a customer receives a cash rebate upon purchasing certain instruments in the north america market during a promotional period 
factors used in the rebate calculations include the identification of instruments sold subject to a rebate during the qualifying period and the estimated lag time between the sale and payment of a rebate 
we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid and record the liability as a reduction of gross revenue when we record the sale of the product 
settlement of the rebate accruals from the date of sale ranges from one to six months after sale 
at march   and  the accrual balances related to customer rebates were   and  respectively 
the increase in the rebate accrual at march   as compared to march   was due to the type of marketing promotions offered during fiscal and and the timing of the rebate obligations paid to the customers 
prior to fiscal  the customer rebate program was not significant in the determination of operating income 
the following table is an analysis of the roll forward activities for the distributor and customer rebate accruals balance at beginning balance at of year provisions payments end of year year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates year ended march  distributor rebates customer rebates total distributor and customer rebates sales and other allowances 
we maintain sales allowances for defective reagent discs  which include the credit that we issue to customers for defective reagent discs 
the balances related to sales allowance for defective reagent discs at march   and were   and  respectively 
the fluctuation in the accrual of the sales allowance for defective reagent discs from year to year is based on the failure rate of reagent discs  the increase in the sale of our reagent discs and the timing of the credit issued to customers 
we also establish  upon shipment of our products to distributors  a provision for potentially defective reagent discs  based on historical experience 
we estimate a provision for the potentially defective reagent discs shipped to distributors during the period using internal data available to estimate the level of inventory in the distribution channel  the lag time for customers to report defective reagent discs and the historical experience of defective reagent discs 
the accrual balances for potentially defective reagent discs at march   and were   and  respectively 
changes in our estimates for accruals related to credits for defective reagent discs have not been material to operating income 
additional provisions and allowances may be required  resulting in decreased revenues  should we experience an increase of defective products 
in the future  the actual defective reagent discs may exceed our estimates  which could adversely affect our operating income 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts based on our assessment of the collectibility of the amounts owed to us by our customers 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers which is mostly determined by the customer s payment history and the outstanding period of accounts 
we specifically identify amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and the allowance for doubtful accounts is adjusted accordingly 
an additional allowance is recorded based on certain percentages of our aged receivables  using historical experience to estimate the potential uncollectible and our assessment of the general financial condition of our customer base 
if our actual collections experience changes  revisions to our allowances may be required  which could adversely affect our operating income 
warranty reserves 
we provide for the estimated future costs to be incurred under our standard warranty obligation on our instruments 
our standard warranty obligation was two years in fiscal and and one year in fiscal the estimated contractual warranty obligation is recorded when the related revenue is recognized and any additional amount is recorded when such cost is probable and can be reasonably estimated 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of our suppliers  our estimated accrual for warranty exposure is based on historical experience  estimated product failure rates  material usage and freight incurred in repairing the instrument after failure and known design changes 
we analyze the adequacy of the ending accrual balance each quarter 
the determination of such allowances requires us to make estimates of the expected costs to repair or replace the instruments under warranty 
if actual repair costs differ significantly from our estimates  adjustments to cost of revenues may be required 
inventories 
we state inventories at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined using standard costs which approximates the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories include material  labor and overhead 
we establish provisions for excess  obsolete and unusable inventories after evaluation of future demand and market conditions 
if future demand or actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated by management or if a significant amount of the material were to become unusable  additional inventory write downs may be required  which would have a negative effect on our operating income 
long lived assets 
the carrying value of our long lived assets is reviewed for impairment  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we look to current and future profitability  as well as current and future undiscounted cash flows  excluding financing costs  as primary indicators of recoverability 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposal is less than the carrying amount 
if impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts to be recovered 
as of march   we had net deferred tax assets of  primarily resulting from net operating loss nols carryforwards  which consists of  of federal nols carryforwards that expire at various dates from fiscal years through at march   we maintained a valuation allowance of  relating to federal research and development tax credits which expire in fiscal in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results and our forecasts of future taxable income and utilization of research and development tax credits 
statutory limitations and short expiration periods represented sufficient negative evidence to require a valuation allowance 
we will continue to evaluate our deferred tax assets in the future to determine whether a deferred tax asset valuation allowance is required at some future point 
share based compensation expense 
on april   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under the fair value provisions of sfas no 
r  we recognize share based compensation expense  net of an estimated forfeiture rate  for those shares expected to vest over the requisite service period of the award to employees and directors 
prior to april   we accounted for share based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and other related guidance and therefore  no employee compensation cost had been recognized for share based awards in financial statements prior to fiscal because we issued stock options with an exercise price equal to the market value at the date of grant 

table of contents we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options granted prior to march  determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires highly subjective assumptions  as described below 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
expected stock price volatility we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a term of one year 
expected term we estimate the expected term of stock options granted based on historical exercise patterns  which we believe are representative of future behavior 
expected dividends 
for restricted stock units  the assumptions to calculate compensation expense is based on the fair value of the company s stock at the grant date 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
as required by sfas no 
r  employee share based compensation expense recognized is calculated based on the awards expected to vest and reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the forfeiture rate is estimated based on historical data of our share based awards that are granted  exercised and cancelled and upon historical experience of employee turnover  and compensation expense is adjusted for actual results 
changes in estimated forfeiture rates and differences between estimated forfeiture rates and actual experience may result in significant  unanticipated increases or decreases in share based compensation expense from period to period 
to the extent we revise our estimate of the forfeiture rate in the future  our share based compensation expense could be materially impacted in the quarter of revision  as well as in following quarters 
the adoption of sfas no 
r had a material impact on our earnings per share and on our financial statements for fiscal  and we expect that it will materially impact our financial statements in the foreseeable future 
the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
r on our financial results is disclosed in note share based compensation in the notes to financial statement in this annual report on form k

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes with respect to our short term investments and line of credit 
we invest excess cash in cash equivalents and in various types of short term investments 
our investment objective is to maximize yields without significantly increased risk 
at march   our short term investments totaled  and there were no unrealized gains 
the short term investments consisted of auction rate securities and corporate debt securities 
although auction rate securities may have maturities beyond one year  these securities were classified as short term  based on their highly liquid nature and due to the frequency with which the interest rate is reset  accordingly we have the ability to quickly liquidate these securities 
in addition  we have the ability to hold the corporate debt securities until maturity and therefore  we believe we have no material exposure to interest rate risk 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in interest rates applied to our investment balances at march  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition 
we have not experienced any significant losses on our investment portfolio 
for our line of credit  which provides for borrowings of up to  the interest rate is equal to the bank s prime rate minus  which totaled at march  consequently  an increase in the prime rate would expose us to higher interest expenses 
a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical movement in the prime rate applied to our line of credit balance at march  indicated that such market movement would not have a material effect on our business  operating results or financial condition  as there was no amount outstanding on our line of credit at march  as a matter of management policy  we do not currently enter into transactions involving derivative financial instruments 
in the event we do enter into such transactions in the future  such items will be accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no
