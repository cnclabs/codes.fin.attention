item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the princeton review provides educational products and services to students  parents  educators and educational institutions 
these products and services include integrated classroom based and online instruction  professional development for teachers and educators  print and online materials and lessons  and higher education marketing 
we operate our businesses through three divisions  which correspond to our business segments 
the test preparation services division derives the majority of its revenue from classroom based and princeton review online test preparation courses and tutoring services 
additionally  test preparation services receives royalties from its independent franchises who provide classroom based courses under the princeton review brand 
since  this division has also been providing ses programs to students in public school districts 
this division has historically accounted for the majority of our overall revenue and accounted for approximately of our overall revenue in in  the test preparation services division s revenue increased by  reflecting a return to historical growth rates after a record growth the prior year due to introduction of the new sat 
during  the fastest growing areas for this division were its ses courses  sales of which have increased in response to the increased emphasis on state assessments  and institutional sales  which are partially attributed to the new sat test introduced in our tutoring revenue grew during the year as well  while retail classroom revenues settled back to levels 
the k services division provides a number of services to k schools and school districts  including assessment  professional development  intervention materials workbooks and related products and face to face instruction 
as a result of the increased emphasis on accountability and the measurement of student performance in public schools in this country and the centralization of school districts purchasing of assessment  professional development and supplemental educational products and services  this division continues to see growing demand by the public school market for its products 
during this division s recognized revenue was adversely impacted by unsigned contracts where work has begun 
for example  during  a large contract representing over million in revenue was unsigned at year end 
accordingly  revenue related to this contract was deferred until despite the revenue shortfall related to this contract  revenue increased by primarily due to the success of k services sales of the sidestreets after school intervention materials the k services division continues to enter into more large  multiple element contracts with schools  school districts  municipal agencies  and other governmental bodies  requiring us to deliver a combination of products and services  including online and print based assessment  professional development  and face to face instruction 
the approval processes of some of our customers in this area  which are required for formal contract execution  are lengthy and cumbersome 
these contracts therefore present several types of risks and uncertainties  including reducing our ability to effectively predict our operating performance  increasing variability in our cash balances and increasing credit risk 
these risks and uncertainties are discussed in detail under the heading risk factors in this annual report on form k 
while we see continued strong revenue growth in this division  operating results are difficult to predict accurately  due to the foregoing factors and the fact that each contract entered into by this division has its own  unique product mix 
because our various products in this division have different gross margins professional development and live course instruction products typically have lower gross margins than fees for assessment products and printed materials  contracts with varying product mix could significantly alter this division s operating results from period to period 
in addition  this division faces challenges related to its rapid growth  including building a first class customer support organization  continually improving quality control processes for customized product and developing better project management tools 
as a result of all of these factors  gross margins in this division declined from in to in throughout the periods discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  our admissions services division derived most of its revenue from the sale of web based admissions and application management products and marketing services to educational institutions 
in  this division represented of our overall revenue 

table of contents as described under business acquisitions and dispositions  during february  we sold the subscription based admissions and application management services business  having reached the conclusion that this line of business could not be grown profitably on a long term basis and was non strategic to our overall educational services businesses 
the sale added cash to our balance sheet  lowered certain corporate support costs and enhanced focus on our core strength of working with students 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
following the completion of the embark sale  we entered into discussions with young shin  the general manager of the admissions services division  regarding a transaction pursuant to which mr 
shin would terminate his employment with the company  and enter into an agreement with the company pursuant to which sales  support  collection  marketing and related functions involved in our higher education institution marketing business will be outsourced to an entity formed by mr 
shin  in exchange for a revenue sharing arrangement 
these discussions are currently at an advanced stage and we anticipate finalization of an agreement in the very near term 
during  we recorded approximately million in revenue from the marketing services that are the subject of this proposed transaction

the following table summarizes the percentage of total revenue for certain expense items to aid in the understanding of the analysis of our operating expenses 
while overall expenses have increased  we are making progress in containing our sg a expenses and expect to see additional improvements in as a percentage of total revenue salaries  labor and employee benefits general and administrative advertising and marketing depreciation and amortization total operating expenses income taxes as a result of the effect of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  on the recoverability of our net deferred tax assets  we decided to record a valuation allowance against any deferred tax benefits 
in and  a deferred tax benefit of and million  respectively  was offset by additions to the valuation allowance of the same amount  resulting in no net us federal or state tax expense in those years 
our foreign subsidiary was profitable during and after utilizing all of its net operating loss carryforward  recorded a tax provision of  our effective income tax rate was and for and  respectively  as a result of the valuation allowances and foreign tax provision 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences that will reduce taxable income in future years 
our loss in  and and the emphasis placed on cumulative losses under generally accepted accounting principles represents sufficient evidence under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  for us to determine that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
although management expects these assets will ultimately be fully utilized  future performance cannot be assured 
the company will continue to evaluate the need for the valuation allowance in future periods 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   total revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in retail course revenue decreased by million  driven by lower sat course revenue  primarily due to a very significant increase in revenues driven by the new sat introduced at that time 
tutoring revenue increased by million and institutional sales increased by million  inclusive of a million ses increase 
k services revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in intervention revenue increased by million resulting from new customer contracts  as well as price increases for our sidestreets products 
professional development revenue increased by million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in assessment services revenue of million primarily due to fewer test administrations earlier in the year and the deferral of assessment revenues from the fourth quarter of into as a result of delaying the revenue recognition for a large contract for testing due to the inability to obtain final customer signatures before year end 
admissions services revenue increased by million or  from million in to million in higher education technology revenue increased by million and higher education marketing services increased by  cost of revenue 
for the year ended december   total cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase is due to an increase in site rent of  because more classes were held  a  increase in tutoring pay to support higher levels of revenue and as a result of a salary increase  a million increase in costs to service the expanded ses courses and a  increase in the costs of content expenditures for books and courses 
gross margin declined by from to due to product mix which included a greater portion of revenue in from ses which has lower gross margins 
additionally  as a result of lower retail classroom enrollments there was reduced classroom utilization which translates into lower profit margins 
k services cost of revenue increased by million  or approximately  from million in to million in gross margin declined by  from to 
this drop in gross margins is attributed to four factors 
first  the higher margin assessment revenues decreased compared to the levels 
second  while intervention revenues increased  the margins on sidestreets revenues are lower than the intervention materials sold in third  we experienced higher customer support costs for many new customer contracts delivered in as we continue to work out the logistics of content development  q a  printing and delivery for multiple customers 
lastly  our content amortization 
table of contents costs increased as a percentage of revenue primarily due to the large investment in developing the sidestreets materials during admissions services cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in gross margin declined by  from to primarily due to lower margins related to higher educational services revenue

other income expense during  other expense of  includes the premium paid to fletcher international  ltd 
of approximately  related to the redemption of  shares of our series b preferred stock 
this was partially offset by the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and warrant related to the series b preferred stock 
during  the company had other income of approximately million comprised of million in ses territory rights sales to franchisees and million related to the change in value of the embedded derivatives and warrant 
income taxes the estimated effective tax rate used in and would have been approximately 
during we continued to record a valuation allowance against the increase in our deferred tax asset 
when we achieve profitability  any tax provision recorded as a result of these pre tax profits will be offset by a reversal of the tax valuation allowance previously recorded  which reversal would be for the same amount as the provision 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december  total revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in 
table of contents test preparation services revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase is driven by an increase of million in retail  institutional and tutoring revenue  once again reflecting strong enrollment in sat  lsat and mcat courses  and million in ses revenue 
k services revenue increased by million  or  from million in to approximately million in this increase is driven by million in assessment services  million in workbook intervention materials primarily sidestreets and  of professional development services 
admissions services revenue increased by  or  from million in to million in this increase is driven by an increase of approximately  in revenue from counseling services  and a million increase in higher education marketing fees 
reductions to revenue include a decrease in higher education technology fees and book related revenues related to timing 
cost of revenue for the year ended december   total cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase is primarily driven by the variable expense increase related to higher retail enrollments  and higher tutoring and institutional revenue 
gross margin declined slightly by from to 
k services cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase is driven by variable expense of approximately million on million of incremental revenue growth 
in addition  there was an increase of  of web content amortization an  increase related to incremental content production and labor related expense 
gross margin declined by from to due to revenue timing and content production related costs 
admissions services cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase is driven by an increase of  in counseling expense and  of other related expense in support of both the technology and marketing business 
gross margins declined by from to 
the key drivers of this reduction relate to  in revenue credits driving approximately of the decline  as well as approximately in consulting mix and another attributed to the cost base 
selling  general administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expense increased by approximately million or  from million in to million in this increase is attributed to salary expense of million  office rent and related expense of  professional fees primarily related to sarbanes oxley of million   in advertising and recruitment expense and workers compensation fees of  impairment of goodwill our results included a write down of approximately million of goodwill related to the acquisition of embark 
com  inc interest expense interest expense remained about the same at  in and  in other income expense during  other income of million includes the change in the fair value of the embedded derivatives and warrant  of approximately million  related to the series b preferred stock and the sale of ses territory rights to franchisees for million 
during  the company had  of other income related to the change in value of the embedded derivatives and warrant 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents on hand  collections from customers and our credit facility 
our test preparation services division has historically generated  and continues to generate  the largest portion of our cash flow from its retail classroom and tutoring courses 
these customers usually pay us in advance or contemporaneously with the services we provide  thereby supporting our short term liquidity needs 
increasingly  however  across all of our divisions  we are generating a greater percentage of our cash from contracts 
table of contents with institutions such as schools  school districts and post secondary institutions  all of which pay us in arrears 
typical payment performance for these institutional customers  once invoiced  ranges from to days 
additionally  the long contract approval cycles and or delays in purchase order generation with some of our contracts with large institutions or school districts can contribute to the level of variability in the timing of our cash receipts 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
the million increase in cash from the december  balance is primarily attributed to million in borrowings against a new credit line and reduction in capital spending of approximately million  offset by a reduction in cash provided from operations 
cash provided by operating activities is our net loss adjusted for certain non cash items and changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during  cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily attributed to a larger net loss in  adjusted for higher depreciation and amortization and bad debt expense in the increase in accounts receivable of million results from late december billings in the k services division because of late contract closing 
this also caused our deferred income to increase by million 
offsetting this was an increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses due to slower payments at the end of the year 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities as compared to million used during this decrease results from reduced technology spending and a reduction of million in content development expenditures 
financing cash flows consist primarily of transactions related to our debt and equity structure 
we added approximately million in compared to net amount used of million during during  we entered into a new credit line and term loan and borrowed million 
part of this borrowing was used to redeem million of series b preferred stock 
in november  due to a planned restatement of its historical financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and  the company was unable to timely file its form q for the third quarter of resulting in the company failing to maintain an effective registration statement for the benefit of the holder of its series b preferred stock 
if the holder requests redemption of the series b preferred stock the company must redeem for cash because it cannot redeem for registered shares of common stock 
accordingly  there is the possibility that the company may be required to fund any future redemptions in cash until it is again able to maintain an effective resale registration statement for the benefit of the holder of the series b preferred stock in accordance with the terms of the agreement governing the registration requirements 
on march   the company borrowed million pursuant to an increase negotiated in their existing line of credit agreement which along with cash on hand and cash generated from operations  should provide the funds necessary to effect any such potential redemption 
our future liquidity needs will depend on  among other factors  the timing and extent of technology development expenditures  new business bookings  the timing and collection of receivables and continuing initiatives designed to improve operating cash flow 
we believe that our current cash balances and anticipated operating cash flow will be sufficient to fund our normal operating requirements for the next months 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under our line of credit  long term office and classroom leases  obligations under promissory notes entered into in connection with acquisitions  employment agreements and several capital leases of computer equipment 
as of december   we operated from leased premises in arizona  california  colorado  georgia  illinois  louisiana  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  missouri  new jersey  new york  north carolina  ohio  oklahoma  oregon  pennsylvania  tennessee  texas  virginia  washington  washington dc  puerto rico and canada 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments set forth therein as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations total purchase obligations consist of payments required under employment agreements 
adoption of new accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb issued sfas no  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior period financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued 
table of contents financial statements to reflect the correction of an error 
this statement is effective for accounting changes and a correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  and did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb released fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income taxes and prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
fin prescribes a two step evaluation process for tax positions 
the first step is recognition based on a determination of whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step is to measure a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if a tax position does not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the benefit of that position is not recognized in the financial statements 
fin is effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal the cumulative effects  if any  of applying fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption which for calendar year companies is january  the company does not expect this pronouncement to have a significant impact on its consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the estimates  methods and judgments we use in applying our accounting policies significantly impact the results we report in our financial statements 
some of our accounting policies require us to make subjective and difficult judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include the assessment of the collectability of our accounts receivable balances  which impacts bad debt write offs  recoverability of goodwill  which impacts goodwill impairment expense  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating margins when we record the impairment of assets or accelerate their depreciation  valuation of embedded derivatives and warrant which impacts gain or loss on derivative instruments  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision  revenue recognition requirements  which impacts how and when we recognize revenue from our goods and services and the estimates we use to record stock based compensation expense 
below  we discuss these policies further  as well as the estimates and judgments involved 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we review our aged receivables monthly 
this review includes discussions with our customers and their account representatives  the customers payment history and other factors 
based on these reviews we may increase or decrease our allowance for uncollectible accounts if we determine there is a change in the collectability of our accounts receivable 
goodwill and territorial marketing rights 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist 
no impairment was indicated in or in  we recorded an impairment expense of million against goodwill in our admissions services division due to the continued poor performance of this division 
our impairment review process is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses our estimates of revenue for the reporting units  driven by assumed market growth rates as well as appropriate discount rates 
these estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage the underlying businesses 
long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total future undiscounted net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
embedded derivatives and warrant 
our series b preferred stock contains two embedded derivatives that  consistent with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities are accounted for separately from the preferred stock 
the two embedded derivatives  the holder s 
table of contents conversion option and the make whole provision  are accounted for on a combined basis and  along with the warrant  reported at fair value 
any changes to fair value are reflected in other income expense and totaled  million and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we must calculate the fair value of these embedded derivatives and warrant at the end of each quarter 
in making these calculations  the key estimates and assumptions that we use include the estimated life of the preferred stock and the warrant  the volatility rates applicable to the trading price of our common stock and the probability of events that would trigger the operation of the make whole provision 
factors considered in the determination of the key assumptions include the likelihood of the holder s conversion or redemption based upon current stock prices and interest rates  as well as historical stock prices to determine volatility 
currently  the company s use of derivatives is limited to the embedded features within its preferred stock 
income taxes 
in determining income for financial statement purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
at december   we had a net deferred tax asset of approximately million  primarily relating to our net operating loss carryforwards of million  which expire in varying amounts between and realization of our deferred tax asset is dependent on generating sufficient taxable income in the united states prior to expiration of these loss carryforwards 
as of december   we recorded a valuation allowance for the entire net deferred tax asset because our loss in and the emphasis placed on cumulative losses under generally accepted accounting principles represented sufficient evidence under sfas no 
accounting for income taxes for us to determine that it was appropriate to establish a full valuation allowance 
if  in the future  an appropriate level and consistency of profitability is attained  we would reduce the valuation allowance  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
in general our revenue recognition policies do not require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective  with the possible exception being the recognition of revenue for separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accounting for multiple element arrangements  one of the key judgments to be made is the accounting value that is attributable to the different contractual elements 
the appropriate allocation of value not only impacts which segment is credited with the revenue  it also impacts the amount and timing of revenue recorded in the consolidated statement of operations during a given period due to the differing methods of recognizing revenue for each product or service by each of the segments 
revenue is allocated to each element based on the accounting determination of the relative fair value of that element to the aggregate fair value of all elements 
the fair values must be reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable 
when available  such determination is based principally on the pricing of similar arrangements with unrelated parties that are not part of a multiple element arrangement 
if fair values are not objectively determinable  revenue is recorded as unearned and recognized ratably over the service period 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment statement r  applying the modified prospective method 
prior to the adoption of statement r  the company applied the provisions of the accounting principles board opinion apbo no

the assumptions used in valuing the options granted during the years ended december   and are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
because option pricing models incorporate ranges of assumptions  those ranges are disclosed 
these assumptions are based on various factors  including  expected future exercise patterns and the expected volatility of the company s stock price 
the risk free interest rate is the imputed forward rate based on the us treasury yield at the date of grant 
the company uses the historical volatility of the company s stock price over the expected term of the options to estimate the expected volatility

seasonality in results of operations we experience  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue because the markets in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations based on the scheduled dates for standardized admissions tests and the typical school year 
these fluctuations could result in volatility or adversely affect our stock price

our k services division experiences seasonal fluctuations in revenue  with the first and fourth quarters corresponding to the school year expected to have the highest revenue
