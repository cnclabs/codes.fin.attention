item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
special note certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of see risk factors and risk factors special note regarding forward looking statements 
in the following discussions  most percentages and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid the presentation 
as a result  all such figures are approximations 
overview we develop and market tissue based products for use in reconstructive  orthopedic and urogynecologic surgical procedures to repair soft tissue defects 
our core technology produces a unique regenerative tissue matrix that creates an ideal biological framework for organizing the same tissue regeneration process that the body undergoes to repair worn or damaged tissue 
our current products include alloderm  for plastic reconstructive  general surgical  burn and periodontal procedures  cymetra  a particulate form of alloderm suitable for injection  graftjacket  for orthopedic applications and lower extremity wounds  allocraftdbm  for bone grafting procedures  and repliform  for urogynecologic surgical procedures 
our research and development initiatives include programs designed to extend the use of our currently marketed regenerative tissue matrix products into new surgical applications  as well as leveraging our core technology to other tissues  including tissues recovered from non human sources 
revenue and expenses revenues 
we market alloderm for plastic reconstructive  general surgical and burn applications through our direct sales organization 
alloderm is primarily sold to hospitals for use by general and plastic surgeons 
our products for orthopedic and urogynecologic procedures are marketed through independent sales agents and distributors 
our strategic sales and marketing partners include wright medical group  inc for graftjacket and graftjacket xpress  stryker corporation for allocraftdbm  boston scientific for repliform  and biohorizons for periodontal applications of alloderm 
in  we expect our revenues to increase as we further penetrate the reconstructive market 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  electing the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas r and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this form k have not been restated 
stock based compensation is included in the same financial statement captions as an employee s salary 
cost of products sold 
cost of products sold consists primarily of fees paid to tissue recovery organizations  tissue procurement support costs  labor  overhead and supplies costs related to the processing of our tissue based products 
cost of products sold also includes depreciation  freight handling and packaging costs 
in  we expect cost of products sold to decrease slightly as a percentage of total revenue due to cost efficiencies achieved through increased processing volume 
research and development 
research and development  or r d  expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our research  product development and clinical functions  as well as the costs of pre clinical and clinical studies and other product development related costs 
we expense all r d costs in the period incurred 
our r d initiatives include programs designed to extend the use of our current regenerative tissue matrix products into new surgical applications  as well as leveraging our core technology to other tissues  including tissues recovered from non human sources 
r d expenditures are expected to remain at approximately the same percentage of revenue as in general and administrative 
general and administrative  or g a  expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel serving the executive  finance  information technology  human resources and regulatory affairs functions  as well as legal fees  accounting fees and insurance costs 
in  we expect g a costs to increase as we add personnel to support the growth in the company  however  we anticipate a slight decrease in g a costs as a percentage of total revenue 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel costs within our sales  marketing and customer support functions  commissions paid to our sales representatives and costs associated with medical education  market research and promotional activities 
in  we expect sales and marketing expenses to increase due to the expansion of our sales force by at the end of  and marketing costs associated with preparation for the anticipated product launch early in of our animal based regenerative tissue product

revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors  including stock options and restricted stock based on estimated fair values 
we elected the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas r and  accordingly  prior year results have not been restated 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was million 
detail of the stock based compensation expense by financial statement caption  including the stock based compensation as a percentage of revenue  was as follows year ended december  dollars in thousands dollars of revenue cost of products sold research and development general and administrative selling and marketing total stock based compensation at december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non vested stock options and restricted stock  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of products sold of million  or of product revenue for the same period in cost of products sold in was negatively impacted by a million write off of inventory associated with a previously announced product recall 
in addition  a  reserve was established to cover estimated product returns and other costs related to the product recall 
total research and development expenses increased by million  or to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to i payroll and related expenses associated with increased headcount and annual merit increases  ii stock based compensation expense  iii professional fees and expenses related to pre clinical studies  and iv operating supplies

selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to i higher selling expenses  principally payroll  commissions and travel and entertainment resulting from the expansion of our direct sales force  ii stock based compensation expense and iii an increase in marketing and medical education program expenses for alloderm 
selling and marketing expenses included agent fees of million and million  respectively  in the years ended december  and the increase in agent fees resulted from an increase in revenue generated through our independent sales and marketing agents 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net increased by million  or to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in due to an increase in interest income resulting from a higher level of invested cash and higher rate of return 

table of contents income tax provision the provision for income taxes increased by million  or to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the same period in resulting in an effective income tax rate of and  respectively 
the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense for incentive stock options  which currently cannot be recognized for tax purposes 
in addition  during  we recognized deferred tax benefits of  resulting from a change in the projected federal tax rate that reduced our effective tax rate 
although we recorded a tax provision in and  we were not required to pay regular federal income taxes due to the utilization of our net operating loss carry forwards 
we paid estimated federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes of  in and  in in the first half of  we expect to utilize all available net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards  and accordingly will be required to pay regular federal income taxes for the balance of the year 
years ended december  and revenues total revenues for the year ended december  increased by million  or to million compared to million for the same period in the increase was attributable to a increase in product revenues to million in the current period as compared to million in the prior year 
revenues generated from the use of our products in reconstructive surgical procedures increased by million  or to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the growth was primarily driven by increased surgeon demand for alloderm in complex hernia repair procedures and breast reconstruction procedures 
alloderm revenues increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million in orthopedic product revenue grew by million or to million in from million in this revenue growth resulted from increased demand for our graftjacket products 
graftjacket revenues were million in compared to million in revenues generated from the use of our repliform product in urogynecologic surgical procedures increased to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in demand for repliform in pelvic floor repairs increased  but the growth was partially offset by decreased use of repliform for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence  which has been negatively affected by competition from synthetic alternatives 
we utilize independent sales and marketing agents and distributors to supplement our direct sales organization in certain markets 
our independent sales and marketing agents and distributors generated of our total product revenue in the year ended december  and in boston scientific and wright medical group represented and  respectively  of our total product revenues in compared to and  respectively  for the same period in no other individual independent sales agent or distributor generated more than of our total product revenues in the year ended december  research grant revenues decreased by million  or to million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in research spending on projects funded by approved research grants  since research grant revenues are recognized when qualified expenses are incurred 
as of december   approximately million of approved grant funding was available to fund future research and development expenses through the end of costs and expenses cost of products sold for the year ended december  was million  or of product revenues  compared to cost of products sold of million  or of product revenue  for the same period in cost of products sold includes the impact of a million inventory write off related to a voluntary product recall in the third quarter of the increase in cost of products sold as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to the inventory write off and increased tissue recovery costs  partially offset by efficiencies gained through increased processing volume 
total research and development expenses increased by million  or to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to i increased payroll and related expenses resulting from increases in the scientific and technical staff  ii increased outside testing and services  iii increased operating supplies and iv increased pre clinical testing 

table of contents general and administrative expenses increased by million  or to million in the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to i increases in payroll and related expenses associated with increased headcount  annual merit increases and expense associated with the issuance of restricted stock  ii professional fees  iii depreciation expense associated with a new fully integrated computer software system and iv an increase in insurance expense 
selling and marketing expenses increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to i selling expenses  principally payroll  commissions and travel and entertainment resulting from the expansion of our direct sales force and increased revenues  ii payroll and related expenses associated with increased marketing headcount  annual merit increases and expense associated with the issuance of restricted stock  iii an increase in professional fees for market research  and iv an increase in expenses for medical education programs 
our independent sales and marketing agents are paid agency fees based on the amount of product revenues they generate for us 
selling and marketing expenses included agent fees of million and million  respectively  in and agency fees decreased because one of our independent sales and marketing agents changed from an agency relationship to a distributor relationship and no longer was paid agency fees 
interest and other income  net interest and other income  net increased by  or to million in compared to  in the net increase was due to an increase in interest income resulting from a higher level of average investments and higher rate of return 
income tax provision the provision for income taxes was million in compared to  in during  we recognized a non cash income tax benefit resulting from a change in the projected tax rate that future year tax benefits are expected to be recovered or settled 
the favorable impact of the tax benefit on net income in was  during  we reduced the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets to reflect net deferred tax assets that we believed were more likely than not of being realized 
the reduction in the valuation allowance resulted in the recognition of a non cash income tax benefit of million in although we recorded a tax provision in and  we were not required to pay regular federal income taxes due to the utilization of net operating loss carry forwards 
we paid estimated federal alternative minimum taxes and state income taxes of  in and  in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  million in short term marketable securities and million in long term marketable securities 
working capital increased to million at december  from million at december  the increase in working capital resulted primarily from increases in short term investments  accounts receivable  and inventories  partially offset by a decrease in cash and cash equivalents  deferred tax assets and an increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
we generated million of positive cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in the positive cash flow from operating activities in was principally due to higher net income after adjustments for non cash items and normal increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities associated with our growth  partially offset by a planned increase in inventories to support anticipated growth  and an increase in receivables associated with higher revenue 
although we recorded a tax provision in and  we were not required to pay regular federal income taxes due to the utilization of our net operating loss carry forwards 
in the first half of we expect to utilize all remaining available net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards  and therefore will be required to pay regular federal income taxes for the balance of the year 
capital expenditures were million in compared to million in and consisted primarily of leasehold improvements related to a facility expansion and the purchase of manufacturing and computer equipment 
our financing activities generated million for the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in in  the cash generated from financing activities resulted from cash proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options and the related excess tax benefits realized 
in  the cash generated from financing activities resulted from cash proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options and warrants 

table of contents the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations as of december  payments due by period dollars in thousands total less than year years years more than years operating leases licensing agreement total contractual cash obligations purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
although we have entered into contracts for services  the obligations under these contracts were not significant  and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
we have also entered into employment agreements with certain executive officers that provide for potential payments and benefits upon employment termination 
such payments and benefits have not been included in the table above since potential payments are contingent upon uncertain future events 
at the end of  we commenced a multi year facility expansion at our branchburg  new jersey facility to increase office space  research labs and processing capacity 
capital expenditures associated with the ongoing facility project are estimated to be approximately million in we believe that our current cash resources  together with anticipated product revenues and committed research and development grant funding  will be sufficient to finance our planned operations  research and development programs and capital expenditure requirements in the foreseeable future 
however  we may need additional funds to meet our long term strategic objectives  including the completion of potential acquisitions 
we have no commitments for any future funding  and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding in the future through debt or equity financings  collaborative arrangements or other sources on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve significant restrictive covenants 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations for the years ended december   and critical accounting policies estimates we have identified the policies below as critical to the understanding of our financial statements 
the application of these policies requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the valuation of assets and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from these estimates 
the impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations are discussed below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue for product sales when title to products and risk of loss are transferred to customers  which is generally when product is shipped to the customer 
additional conditions for recognition of revenue are that collection of sales proceeds is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
we utilize independent sales and marketing agents to supplement our direct sales organization 
for products marketed through our independent sales and marketing agents  we recognize revenue when the products are delivered to the third party customer  as this is when title and risk of loss to the product transfers 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are included in revenue at the time the related product revenue is recognized with the related expenses recorded in cost of products sold 
research grant revenues are recognized at the time qualified expenses are incurred  unless we have continuing performance obligations  in which case revenue is recognized upon the satisfaction of such obligations 
accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for estimated bad debt losses on our accounts receivable based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
since our accounts receivable are not concentrated within a relatively few number of customers  we believe that a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one customer would not have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and therefore our future operating results 
while bad debt losses depend to a large degree on future economic conditions affecting our customers  we do not anticipate significant bad debt losses in 
table of contents inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined on a first in  first out basis 
we record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on inventory quantities on hand  our historical product sales  and estimated forecast of future product demand and production requirements 
although we believe that our current inventory reserves are adequate  any significant change in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and  therefore  our future operating results 
income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  no assurance can be given that the final outcome of these matters will not be different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
we apply an asset and liability approach to accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent upon our assessment of whether it is more likely than not that sufficient future taxable income will be generated to utilize the deferred tax asset 
in the event we determine that future taxable income will not be sufficient to utilize the deferred tax asset  a valuation allowance is recorded 
interest related to income taxes is included in the financial caption interest and other income  net 
tax penalties are included in the financial caption general and administrative expense 
share based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r which establishes accounting for equity instruments exchanged for employee service 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee share based compensation at the date of grant  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
further  as required under sfas r  we now estimate forfeitures for options granted  which are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
these assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop 
when estimating fair value  some of the assumptions will be based on  or determined from  external data and other assumptions may be derived from our historical experience with stock based payment arrangements 
the appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment  based on relevant facts and circumstances 
we estimated volatility by considering both implied volatility derived from publicly traded options to purchase lifecell common stock and historical stock volatility 
as allowed by staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payment  we have opted to use the simplified method for estimating expected term equal to the midpoint between the vesting period and the contractual term 
we estimate forfeitures using historical employee turn over rates 
our estimates of forfeitures will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimate 
new accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
 or sfas sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements for changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation  amortization  or depletion method for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate affected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of sfas on january  did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in november  fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas and fas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp  which provides guidance on determining when investments in certain debt and equity securities are considered impaired  whether that impairment is other than temporary  and on measuring such impairment loss 
fsp also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of an other than temporary impairment and requires certain disclosures about unrealized losses that have not been recognized as other than temporary impairments 
fsp is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  our adoption of fsp on january  did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 

table of contents in july  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position 
fin indicates that an enterprise shall initially recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not of being sustained on examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
in addition  fin indicates that the measurement of a tax position that meets the more likely than not threshold shall consider the amounts and probabilities of the outcomes that could be realized upon ultimate settlement 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect the impact of adopting fin to be immaterial 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the implementation of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of determining whether the current year s financial statements are materially misstated 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  the implementation of sab did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our investments in certain marketable securities  consisting principally of fixed income debt securities 
a change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations 
although our investments are available for sale  we generally hold such investments to maturity 
our investments are stated at fair value  with net unrealized gains or losses on the securities recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
net unrealized gains and losses were not material at december  or
