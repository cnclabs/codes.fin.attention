item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and the other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
this report and the following discussion contain forward looking statements regarding the electronic devices and communications equipment industries and our expectations regarding our future performance  liquidity and capital resources 
our actual results could differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements as a result of any number of factors  including those set forth under risk factors and under other captions contained elsewhere in this report 
overview general through our three wholly owned operating subsidiaries  emrise electronics  cxr larus and cxr aj  and through the divisions and subsidiaries of those subsidiaries  we design  develop  manufacture  assemble  and market products and services in the following two material business segments o electronic devices electronic power supplies digital and rotary switches rf and microwave devices o communications equipment network access and transmission products communication timing and synchronization products communications test instruments sales to customers in the electronic devices segment  primarily to aerospace customers  defense contractors and industrial customers  were approximately  and of our total net sales during  and  respectively 
sales of communications equipment and related services  primarily to private customer premises and public carrier customers  were approximately  and of our total net sales during  and  respectively 
larus corporation acquisition on july   we acquired larus corporation 
larus corporation was a san jose  california based manufacturer and seller of telecommunications products that had one wholly owned subsidiary  vista labs  incorporated  or vista  which provided engineering services to larus corporation 
we paid  to acquire the outstanding common stock of larus corporation  which included a significant premium over the  recorded net worth of assets that included intellectual property  cash  accounts receivable and inventories owned by each of larus corporation and vista 
the purchase price for the acquisition consisted of  in cash  the issuance of  shares of our common stock with a fair value of   in the form of two short term  zero interest promissory notes that were repaid in   in the form of two subordinated secured promissory notes  warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at per share  which were valued at  and approximately  of acquisition costs 
in addition  we assumed  in accounts payable and accrued expenses and entered into an above market real property lease with the sellers 
the lease represented an obligation that exceeded the fair market value by approximately  and is part of the acquisition accounting 
the cash portion of the acquisition purchase price was funded with proceeds from our prior credit facility with wells fargo bank  na and cash on hand 
pascall acquisition on march   our subsidiary  eel  purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of pehl  the parent holding company of pascall  using funds loaned to eel by emrise 
the purchase price for the acquisition totaled  subject to adjustments as described in the purchase agreement  and included cash payments totaling  to intelek properties limited pehl s former parent  which was a subsidiary of intelek plc  a london stock exchange public limited company  a  loan used by pehl and pascall to immediately repay intercompany debt owed to intelek properties limited  and approximately  in acquisition costs 
we and intelek plc agreed to guarantee payment when due of all amounts payable by eel and intelek properties limited  respectively  under the purchase agreement 
we and eel agreed to underwrite the guaranty that intelek properties limited has given to pascall s landlord with a guaranty by us  and eel has agreed to indemnify intelek properties limited and its affiliates for damages they suffer as a result of any failure to obtain the release of the guarantee of the year lease that commenced in may the leased property is a  square foot administration  engineering and manufacturing facility located off the south coast of england 
intelek properties limited has agreed to various restrictive covenants that apply for various periods following the closing 
the covenants include non competition with pascall s business  noninterference with pascall s customers and suppliers  and non solicitation of pascall s employees 
in conjunction with the closing  intelek properties limited  intelek plc  eel  and we entered into a supplemental agreement dated march  the supplemental agreement provides  among other things  that an interest free bridge loan of  british pounds sterling approximately  based on the exchange rate in effect on march  that was made by the seller to pascall on march  and was repaid in full by pascall on the march  due date 
the purchase price represented a significant premium over the recorded net worth of pascall s assets 
in conjunction with the acquisition of pascall  the company commissioned a valuation firm to determine what portion of the purchase price should be allocated to identifiable intangible assets 
the company considered whether the acquisition included various types of identifiable intangible assets  including trade names  trademarks  patents  covenants not to compete  customers  workforce  technology and software 
the company has recorded the value of the trade name and trademark at  covenants not to compete that were obtained from pascall s former affiliates at  amortizable over three years and backlog at  amortizable over two years 
ro acquisition on september   emrise electronics acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of ro under the terms of a stock purchase agreement dated effective as of august  and amended as of september  the purchase price consisted of  in cash paid at closing and an additional  in cash paid in two equal installments in october and october  which amounts were partially offset by  received from the former ro shareholders to compensate for balance sheet adjustments 
the acquisition purchase price was funded with cash on hand 
in addition  concurrently with the closing of the acquisition of ro  emrise electronics paid in full all then existing credit facilities of ro in the aggregate amount of  in determining the purchase price for ro  emrise electronics considered the historical and expected earnings and cash flow of ro  as well as the value of companies of a size and in an industry similar to ro  comparable transactions and the market for such companies generally 
the purchase price represented a premium of approximately  over the  recorded net worth of the assets of ro 
in determining this premium  emrise electronics considered the synergistic and strategic advantages provided by having a united states based power conversion manufacturer and the value of the goodwill  customer relationships and technology of ro 
goodwill associated with the ro acquisition totaled approximately  we commissioned a valuation firm to determine what portion of the purchase price should be allocated to identifiable intangible assets 
the valuation study of ro s intangibles was completed in june we initially estimated the intangibles to be valued as follows technology   trademarks   and customer relationships   the valuation study resulted in the following valuations technology   trademarks   and customer relationships   the intangibles were adjusted to the appraised values in the second quarter of the technology and customer relationships are being amortized over years on their appraise values and the trademarks are not being amortized due to the inability to determine an estimated life 
in connection with the execution of the stock purchase agreement  emrise electronics executed a lease agreement with caspian associates for the lease of  square feet of a  square feet building located at caspian drive  sunnyvale  california 
the lease provided for a two year term commencing on september  and ending on august   at a base rent of  per month 
additionally  the lease provided for an extension of the lease term for an additional three years  to august   and a rent increase if ro achieves certain net sales and cumulative gross profit targets 
however  the targets were eliminated from the lease when the property was sold on november  also  on march   the lease converted into a month to month tenancy where either party may provide the other with days notice to terminate the lease 
we terminated the lease on march  prior to termination  the lease obligation was  per month  which was more than the original  because a sublessee terminated its sublease in may critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from sales of electronic devices and communications equipment products and services 
our sales are based upon written agreements or purchase orders that identify the type and quantity of the item being purchased and the purchase price 
we recognize revenues when shipment of products has occurred or services have been rendered  no significant obligations remain on our part  and collectibility is reasonably assured based on our credit and collections practices and policies 
we recognize revenues from domestic sales of our electronic devices and communications equipment at the point of shipment of those products 
product returns are infrequent and require prior authorization because our sales are final and we quality test our products prior to shipment to ensure they meet the specifications of the binding purchase orders under which they are shipped 
normally  when a customer requests and receives authorization to return a product  the request is accompanied by a purchase order for a replacement product 
revenue recognition for products and services provided by our united kingdom subsidiaries depends upon the type of contract involved 
engineering design services contracts generally entail design and production of a prototype over a term of up to several years  with all revenue deferred until all services under the contracts have been completed 
production contracts provide for a specific quantity of products to be produced over a specific period of time 
customers issue binding purchase orders for each suborder to be produced 
at the time each suborder is shipped to the customer  we recognize revenue relating to the products included in that suborder 
returns are infrequent and permitted only with prior authorization because these products are custom made to order based on binding purchase orders and are quality tested prior to shipment 
generally  these products carry a one year limited parts and labor warranty 
we do not offer customer discounts  rebates or price protection on these products 
we recognize revenues for products sold by our french subsidiary at the point of shipment 
customer discounts are included in the product price list provided to the customer 
returns are infrequent and permitted only with prior authorization because these products are shipped based on binding purchase orders and are quality tested prior to shipment 
generally  these products carry a two year limited parts and labor warranty 
generally  our electronic devices  network access and transmission products and communication timing and synchronization products carry a one year limited parts and labor warranty and our communications test instruments and european network access and transmission products carry a two year limited parts and labor warranty 
products returned under warranty are tested and repaired or replaced at our option 
historically  warranty repairs have not been material 
we do not offer customer discounts  rebates or price protection on these products 
revenues from services such as repairs and modifications are recognized when the service has been completed and invoiced 
for repairs that involve shipment of a repaired product  we recognize repair revenues when the product is shipped back to the customer 
service revenues represented approximately  and of net sales during  and  respectively 
inventory valuation our finished goods electronic devices inventories generally are built to order 
our communications equipment inventories generally are built to forecast  which requires us to produce a larger amount of finished goods in our communications equipment business so that our customers can promptly be served 
our products consist of numerous electronic and other parts  which necessitates that we exercise detailed inventory management 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory first in  first out or the current estimated market value of the inventory net realizable value 
we perform physical inventories at least once a year 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twelve months 
additionally  to determine inventory write down provisions  we review product line inventory levels and individual items as necessary and periodically review assumptions about forecasted demand and market conditions 
any parts or finished goods that we determine are obsolete  either in connection with the physical count or at other times of observation  are reserved for and subsequently discarded and written off 
in addition  the communications equipment industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
foreign currency translation we have foreign subsidiaries that together accounted for approximately of our net revenues  of our assets and of our total liabilities as of and for the year ended december  in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from the currencies in which they keep their accounting records into united states dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under relevant accounting guidance  are included either within our statement of operations or as a separate part of our net equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
under relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses depends upon our management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
this determination involves consideration of relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures  would be considered the functional currency 
however  management must also consider any dependency of the subsidiary upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations 
if management deems any subsidiary s functional currency to be its local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
however  if management deems the functional currency to be united states dollars  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to united states dollars  then any translation gains or losses arising after the date of the change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the functional currency of each of our international subsidiaries as each subsidiary s local currency 
accordingly  we had cumulative translation gains of  and losses of  that were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within our balance sheets at december  and  respectively 
during the years ended december  and  we included translation adjustment gains of approximately  and losses of approximately  respectively  under accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
if we had determined that the functional currency of our subsidiaries was united states dollars  these gains or losses would have decreased or increased our gain or loss for and the magnitude of these gains or losses depends upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business as compared to the value of the united states dollar 
these currencies include the euro  the british pound sterling and the japanese yen 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher or lower than those we recorded for these periods 
a  loan payable from eel to emrise was outstanding as of december  the majority of this loan is expected to be outstanding indefinitely 
therefore  exchange rate losses and gains on this loan are recorded in cumulative translation gains or losses in the equity section of the balance sheet 
intangibles  including goodwill we periodically evaluate our intangibles  including goodwill  for potential impairment 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
in assessing potential impairment of goodwill  we consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of the acquired businesses 
if forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of those respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that were not previously recorded 
if that were the case  we would have to record an expense in order to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and were required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues by june   and then at least annually after that date or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
at december   the reported goodwill totaled  during  we did not record any impairment losses related to goodwill and other intangible assets 
in conjunction with our july acquisition of larus corporation  we commissioned a valuation firm to determine what portion of the purchase price should be allocated to identifiable intangible assets 
the intangible values are as follows larus trade name and trademark are valued at  and the technology and customer relationships are valued at  goodwill associated with the larus corporation acquisition totaled  the larus trade name and trademark were determined to have indefinite lives and therefore are not being amortized but rather are being periodically tested for impairment 
the technology and customer relationships were both estimated to have ten year lives 
in conjunction with our march acquisition of pascall  we commissioned a valuation firm to determine what portion of the purchase price should be allocated to identifiable intangible assets 
the pascall trade name and trademark are valued at  the covenants not to compete that were obtained from pascall s former affiliates are valued at  the backlog was valued at  total amortization expense of  and  was charged to administrative expense in and  respectively 
the pascall trade name and trademark were determined to have indefinite lives and therefore are not being amortized but rather are being periodically tested for impairment 
the covenants not to compete and backlog are being amortized over their respective three year and two year durations 
we estimated that the goodwill associated with the pascall acquisition totaled  in conjunction with our acquisition of ro  we commissioned a valuation firm to determine what portion of the purchase price should be allocated to identifiable intangible assets 
the valuation study of ro s intangibles was completed in june we initially estimated the intangibles to be valued as follows technology   trademarks   and customer relationships   the valuation study resulted in the following valuations technology   trademarks   and customer relationships   the intangibles were adjusted to the appraised values in the second quarter of the technology and customer relationships are being amortized over years on their appraised values  and the trademarks are not being amortized due to the inability to determine an estimated life

net sales 
the  increase in total net sales for as compared to resulted from the combination of a  increase in net sales of our electronic devices and a  decrease in net sales of our communications equipment products and services 
electronic devices 
the increase in net sales within our electronic devices segment was primarily due to a  increase in sales of power supplies to  in from  in contributing to this increase was a  increase in ro s sales of power supplies due to inclusion of a full year of ro s sales in as compared to only four months of ro s sales included in because we acquired ro on august  pascall increased its sales of power supplies by  to  in however  we acquired pascall on march   so only nine and one half months of sales for pascall were included in our sales 
the remainder of the  increase in sales of power supplies was due to an increase in sales volume for xps 
sales of rf devices by pascall increased by  to  in as compared to  in due to increased sales volume 
sales of switches were  which approximated sales of switches in the prior year 
sales of power supplies are expected to increase in due to our in flight entertainment contracts received or expected and our eurofighter typhoon aircraft contracts 
we also expect future growth in sales for our new vlp r rotary switch 
communications equipment 
the majority of the decrease in sales within our communications equipment segment was due to a  decrease in sales of test equipment to  as compared to  this decrease was mainly due to a lower volume of sales caused by the erosion of the communications industry customer base for our test instruments due to our decision to not invest further in this product line  leaving us mainly selling to customers providing upgrades for a federal aviation administration modernization project 
sales of our network access and transmission products decreased  to  in as compared to  in this decrease resulted from a  decrease in our cxr larus us based sales primarily due to decreased sales volume due to competition  offset by a  increase in our cxr aj french based sales due to increased sales volume 
partially offsetting these decreases was a modest increase in the sales of our timing systems by cxr larus of  to  we expect that sales for cxr aj network access products will improve in while test instrument sales will remain at low levels or decline further 
with the introduction of the new tiempo tm communication timing and synchronization product from cxr larus  we anticipate an improvement in sales of timing products in gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of total net sales decreased to from for the prior year period due to a decrease in communications equipment sales 
in dollar terms  gross profit decreased by  to  for as compared to  for due to a  reduction in gross profit within our communications equipment segment that more than offset a  increase in gross profit within our electronic devices segment 
electronic devices 
the  increase in gross profit within this segment was primarily due to a  increase to  for our uk power supply operations 
of this increase  pascall provided  due to an increase in sales volume and inclusion of a full year of operations in  and xps contributed  due to increased sales volume 
also contributing to the increase in gross profit was the addition of a full year of gross profit of  for ro 
gross profit for switches produced by digitran remained constant at  communications equipment 
the  reduction in gross profit within this segment was primarily due to a decrease of  in test equipment gross profit due to decreased sales volume 
in addition  gross profit for our cxr larus communication timing and network access products declined  due to a  decrease in revenues due to a decrease in sales volume and a decrease in inventory carrying values for certain items deemed to be slow moving 
the gross profit at our cxr aj french operation declined  due to a  decrease in revenues due to a decrease in sales volume and a change in accounting policy necessitating an increase in inventory write off 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms and increased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for as compared to resulted from o  of administrative expenses related to the restatement of our and financial statements and the reaudit of our  and financial statements 
the restatement was necessary because sales of  were recorded in instead of appropriately being recorded in the  of administrative expenses included  of audit expense as compared to  in and  of legal expense  o an increase in administrative expenses primarily due to the increase and inclusion of  and  of administrative costs for pascall and ro  respectively  and o a  expense related to increasing employee compensation related reserves 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses for will decrease from the level experienced in due the completion of our reaudit and restatement 
engineering and product development expenses 
engineering and product development expenses consist primarily of new product development engineering activities 
the  increase in these expenses resulted primarily from the increase of  of expenses attributable to our decision to accelerate the introduction of tiempo tm  a new substantially improved timing system product  and a  increase in engineering expenses attributable to ro 
the increase in engineering expense for the tiempo tm was mainly due to  of contract engineering expenses we incurred in to accelerate product development of our new synchronization timing product 
these increases were partially offset by a  reduction of engineering expenses for switches and power supplies 
overall engineering and product development expenses in are anticipated to be at level similar to the overall level in interest expense and income 
the  increase in interest expense in was due to larger loan balances 
we recorded  of interest income in  which we earned on the proceeds of the january private placement 
other income and expense  net 
other expense in of  was primarily due to currency exchange loss 
other income of  in primarily resulted from a  gain due to the sale of our t com product line and a  net currency exchange gain 
the t com technology and tangible assets had no carrying value 
income tax expense benefit 
the  income tax expense in includes  of foreign taxes and  of state taxes 
we recorded a  provision for federal tax in to reduce our deferred tax assets for federal purposes and to reduce the amount of operating loss carryforwards recognized 
an income tax benefit of  was recorded in primarily because we reduced our tax asset valuation allowance by  and recorded a federal tax benefit of  that was offset by a foreign tax provision of  and a state tax provision of  net loss income 
net loss for was  as compared to net income of  for major contributors to this  difference were as follows o  of expenses related to the restatement and reaudit of our financial statements  o a  lower gross profit of our communications equipment segment primarily due to decreased sales volumes  o an  increase in tax provision primarily due to the  reduction in our tax asset valuation allowance in and increases in foreign and state taxes in  o a  decrease in other income and loss primarily due to currency exchange losses in as compared to a  net currency exchange gain in  and o a  expense related to increasing employee compensation related reserves 
these negative amounts were partially offset with a  increase in gross profit for our electronic devices segment primarily due to a  increase in net sales in this segment

net sales 
the  increase in total net sales for as compared to resulted from the combination of a  increase in net sales of our electronic devices and a  increase in net sales of our communications equipment products and services 
electronic devices 
the increase in net sales within our electronic devices segment resulted primarily from the inclusion in our results of pascall s  sales of power supplies and rf devices and ro s  sales of power conversion products and licensing 
this increase occurred despite a  decrease in sales at xps primarily related to reduced sales of power supplies due to the delay of deliveries for the eurofighter typhoon aircraft 
sales of switches manufactured by digitran increased  to  for from  for the prior year period due to sales of new rotary switches and other new programs for our digital switches 
we first reported sales of rf devices during the three months ended march  as a result of our acquisition of pascall 
we acquired ro on august  if we excluded sales by pascall from march  through december  and sales by ro for september  through december   our electronic devices segment sales would have declined by  or for communications equipment 
the  increase in net sales within our communications equipment segment resulted primarily from the inclusion in our results of the full year of  of net sales of communication timing and synchronization products attributable to our acquisition of larus corporation that occurred on july  as compared to sales of  for the period from july  to december  this increase occurred despite a  decline in net sales of test instruments primarily due to delays and reductions in expected orders from large carriers 
sales of network access equipment produced by cxr aj decreased by  to  in as compared to  in due to lower sales volume in military markets 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of total net sales decreased to from for the prior year period due to a lower gross margin for our communications equipment segment 
in dollar terms  gross profit increased by  to  for as compared to  for primarily as a result of the addition of gross profit from pascall and ro 
electronic devices 
the  increase in gross profit for our electronic devices segment was primarily due to the inclusion in our results for of  of gross profit from pascall and  of gross profit from ro 
partially offsetting these increases was a  reduction in gross profit from switches primarily due to product mix and a  decrease in gross profit on power supplies produced by xps as a direct result of reduced sales volume due to contract delivery delays for the eurofighter typhoon aircraft 
xcel japan ltd

our selling  general and administrative expenses increased in dollar terms but decreased as a percentage of net sales to in from in the  increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for as compared to resulted from o a  increase in sales commissions due to the increase or inclusion of   and  of sales commission expenses of cxr larus  pascall and ro  respectively  partially offset by reductions in commission expenses of  for test instruments and  for our french produced network access products  o a  increase in other selling and marketing expenses primarily due to an increase of  and the inclusion of  and  of selling expenses of our larus division  pascall and ro  respectively  attendance at tradeshows and increased advertising and marketing of our electronic devices 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in these expenses of  for test instruments and  at cxr aj  o a  increase in administrative expenses primarily due to the increase or inclusion of  and  of administrative costs for our larus division and pascall  respectively  o  in severance costs we recorded to administrative expense to reflect a consolidation of cxr larus operations  o a  expense we recorded for a repair provision for the building in wales that we vacated to combine our coil winding business with xps s operations in ashford  england  and o a  increase in our domestic legal expenses and a  increase in our domestic accounting and auditing expenses plus an increase of  in consulting fees relating to internal control documentation in response to the sarbanes oxley act of engineering and product development expenses 
engineering and product development expenses consist primarily of new product development engineering activities 
the  increase in these expenses resulted primarily from the increase of  of expenses attributable to our larus division and a  increase in engineering expenses attributable to pascall 
also  expenses related to development of our new low profile rotary switches increased  to  for as compared to  for during  we eliminated one of our two engineering directors at cxr larus  which is helping to offset approximately  of our increased engineering expenses on an annual basis 
interest expense and income 
interest expense increased by  to  for as compared to  for in addition  we recorded  of interest income in  which we earned on the proceeds of the january  private placement 
we did not have interest income during other income and expense  net 
other income of  for primarily resulted from a  gain due to the sale of our t com product line and  of a net currency exchange gain 
the t com technology and tangible assets had no carrying value 
income tax benefit expense 
income tax benefit for was  compared to an expense of  for primarily because we reduced our tax asset valuation allowance by  and recorded a federal tax benefit of  that was offset by our foreign tax provision of  and a state tax provision of  net income 
net income for increased by  to  as compared to  for the increase was primarily due to an increase in gross profit in our electronic devices segment resulting from our acquisitions of pascall and ro 
we continue to closely monitor costs throughout our operations and have reduced costs through staffing reductions in our communications equipment operations in the united states and france as indicated above 
liquidity and capital resources during  we funded our operations primarily through revenue generated from our operations and through our previous line of credit with wells fargo bank  na bank credit facility  a new credit facility wfbc credit facility with wells fargo bank acting through its wells fargo business credit operating division wfbc  and facilities with various foreign banks 
as of december   we had working capital of  which represented a  decrease from working capital of  at december   primarily due to the  of expenses we incurred in related to the restatement and reaudit of our financial statements and increased accrued expenses 
at december  and  we had accumulated deficits of  and  respectively  and cash and cash equivalents of  and  respectively 
accounts receivable decreased  during  from  as of december  to  as of december  days sales outstanding  which is a measure of our average accounts receivable collection period  decreased from days for to days for our customers include many fortune companies in the united states and similarly large companies in europe and asia 
because of the financial strength of our customer base  we incur few bad debts 
inventory balances increased  during  from  at december  to  at december  inventory represented and of our total assets as of december  and december   respectively 
inventory turnover  which is a ratio that indicates how many times our inventory is sold and replaced over a specified period  was times for as well as for we took various actions to reduce costs in and these actions were intended to reduce the cash outlays of our communications equipment segment to match its revenue rate  which was negatively impacted by the telecommunications downturn of and we merged larus corporation with and into cxr telcom corporation at the end of and integrated their operations 
in  we contracted with a contract manufacturer  hitachi  for production of communication timing and synchronization products at lower prices than our previous cost for in house manufacturing for production that began in the second quarter of cash used in our operating activities totaled  for as compared to cash provided by operating activities of  for this  decrease in operating cash flows primarily resulted from the  net loss and a  increase in inventory that were partially offset by depreciation  amortization and accrued expenses 
cash used in our investing activities totaled  for as compared to  for the amount consists of net increases to property  plant and equipment 
included in the results for are net cash amounts of  and  used to acquire pascall and ro  respectively 
also in  we acquired  of property  plant and equipment purchases for production equipment and computer equipment

we intend to grow our business through both internal growth and further acquisitions that we identify as being potentially both synergistic and accretive of our earnings 
any additional acquisitions would likely be funded through the use of cash and or a combination of cash and notes 
we believe that current and future available capital resources  revenues generated from operations  and other existing sources of liquidity  including the credit facility we have with wfbc  will be adequate to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if  however  we are unable to renew or replace the xps and pascall credit facility with lloyds bank that expires july   or if our capital requirements or cash flow vary materially from our current projections or other unforeseen circumstances occur  or if we require a significant amount of cash to fund future acquisitions  we may require additional financing 
our failure to raise capital  if needed  could restrict our growth  limit our development of new products or hinder our ability to compete

impacts of new accounting pronouncements on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r superseded accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 and amended sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas no 
r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r generally requires share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options and purchases under employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure of fair value recognition is no longer an alternative 
we adopted this new standard on january  using the modified prospective method under which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date of adoption a based on the requirements of sfas no 
r for all share based payments granted after the effective date of adoption and b based on the requirements of sfas no 
for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of adoption that remain unvested on the date of adoption 
sfas no 
r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation expense to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as prescribed under earlier accounting rules 
this requirement reduces net operating cash flows and increases net financing cash flows in periods after adoption 
total cash flow remains unchanged from what would have been reported under prior accounting rules 
in  we recorded expenses of  relating to currently outstanding stock options 
we estimate that in we will record  of additional expenses relating to currently outstanding stock options 
the actual effects of adopting sfas no 
r will depend on numerous factors  including the amounts of share based payments granted in the future  the valuation model we use to value future share based payments to employees and estimated forfeiture rates

sfas no

 accounting changes and error corrections  a replacement of apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements 
sfas no 
changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
previously  most voluntary changes in accounting principles required recognition of a cumulative effect adjustment within net income of the period of the change 
sfas no 
requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas no 
became effective for accounting changes made in fiscal years beginning after december  however  sfas no 
does not change the transition provisions of any existing accounting pronouncements

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
specifically  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to permit fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument with an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  provided the whole instrument is accounted for on a fair value basis 
additionally  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to allow a qualifying special purpose entity to hold a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
sfas no

 fair value measurements 
this new statement provides a single definition of fair value  together with a framework for measuring it  and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets 
the required effective date of sfas no 
is the first quarter of we currently are evaluating the effect this statement may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits an entity to irrevocably elect fair value on a contract by contract basis as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many financial assets and liabilities and certain other items including insurance contracts 
entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings and to expense up front cost and fees associated with the item for which the fair value option is elected 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
we currently are evaluating the effect that adoption of sfas no 
would have on our financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  and other matters 
these provisions are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of we currently are assessing the effect of this statement and currently do not believe that adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
on june   the fasb ratified emerging issues task force eitf issue no

sab no 
addresses how to quantify the effect of an error on the financial statements and requires a dual approach to compute the materiality of the misstatement 
specifically  the amount of the misstatement is to be computed using both the rollover that is  the current year income statement perspective and the iron curtain that is  the year end balance sheet perspective 
sab no 
is effective for all fiscal years ending after november  accordingly  we adopted sab no

exchange rate sensitivity we have established and acquired international subsidiaries that prepare their balance sheets in the relevant foreign currency 
in order to be included in our consolidated financial statements  these balance sheets are converted  at the then current exchange rate  into united states dollars  and the statements of operations are converted using weighted average exchange rates for the applicable period 
accordingly  fluctuations of the foreign currencies relative to the united states dollar affect our consolidated financial statements 
our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates has increased as a result of the growth or acquisition of our international subsidiaries 
however  because historically the majority of our currency exposure has related to financial statement translation rather than to particular transactions  prior to we had not entered into forward currency contracts or hedging arrangements in an effort to mitigate our currency exposure 
for further information regarding our exchange rate sensitivity  see item of this report under the heading critical accounting policies foreign currency translation

sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at its fair value 
sfas no 
also requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met  and that a company must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
we currently use derivatives to manage foreign currency rate risk 
one of our united kingdom subsidiaries that conducts business in british pounds sterling has a program that utilizes forward currency contracts denominated in united states dollars to offset the risk associated with the effects of currency exposure for sales in united states dollars 
under this program  increases or decreases in the subsidiary s foreign currency exposure are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts  to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency translation gains or losses 
these forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use these forward contracts for trading purposes 
all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts used in this program are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in other income and expense 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
net foreign exchange translation gains and losses included in other income and expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations totaled a  loss for and a  gain for a substantial portion of our notes payable and long term debt have variable interest rates based on the prime interest rate and or the lender s base rate  which exposes us to risk of earnings loss due to changes in such interest rates
