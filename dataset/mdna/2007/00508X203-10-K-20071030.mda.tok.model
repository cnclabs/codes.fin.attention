item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations background as discussed in item  business  we are a diversified global provider of a broad range of industrial products and systems organized under four operating segments 
the industrial segment is primarily involved in the design  manufacture and distribution of branded hydraulic and mechanical tools to the construction  industrial  oil gas  and production automation markets 
in addition  this segment provides manpower services and product rental to the global joint integrity market 
the electrical segment is primarily involved in the design  manufacture  and distribution of electrical tools and supplies to the retail home center  hardware cooperative  electrical wholesale and marine markets 
the actuation systems segment focuses on developing and marketing value added  customized motion control systems and equipment for original equipment manufacturers in the recreational vehicle  automotive  truck  and other industrial markets 
the engineered products segment designs and manufactures a variety of products for industrial markets 
the company has not aggregated individual operating segments within these reportable segments 
the company evaluates segment performance based primarily on net sales and operating profit 

table of contents our long term goal is to grow annual diluted earnings per share excluding unusual or non recurring items eps faster than most multi industry peers 
we intend to leverage our leading market positions to generate annual internal sales growth that exceeds the annual growth rates of the gross domestic product in the geographic regions in which we operate 
in addition to internal sales growth  we are focused on acquiring complementary businesses 
following an acquisition  we seek to drive cost reductions  develop additional cross selling opportunities and deepen customer relationships 
we also focus on profit margin expansion and cash flow generation to achieve our eps growth goal 
our lead lean enterprise across disciplines process utilizes various continuous improvement techniques to drive out costs and improve efficiencies across all locations and functions worldwide  thereby expanding profit margins 
strong cash flow generation is achieved by maximizing returns on assets and minimizing primary working capital needs 
the cash flow that results from efficient asset management and improved profitability is used to reduce debt and fund additional acquisitions and internal growth opportunities 
our application of this strategy has generated profitable growth over the past seven years

the reduced operating profit was primarily due to unfavorable product line sales mix higher auto and rv actuation systems volumes and lower production levels of truck actuation systems  and higher research development expenses to support future truck growth initiatives  both of which were partially mitigated by material cost reductions resulting from increased low cost country sourcing and improved customer pricing 
although segment operating profit margins declined on a full year basis from to in fiscal  operating profit margins improved on a year over year basis during the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the benefits of initiatives to improve segment profitability  which included customer price increases  improving plant efficiency through our lead process  and further expansion of our low cost country sourcing

financing costs increased during fiscal by approximately million to million due to higher market interest rates on variable rate debt and additional debt incurred for fiscal acquisitions 
income tax expense the company s income tax expense is impacted by a number of factors  including the amount of taxable earnings derived in foreign jurisdictions with tax rates that are higher or lower than the us federal statutory rate  state tax rates in the jurisdictions where we do business  tax minimization planning  and our ability to utilize various tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
the company s effective income tax rate in fiscal was  compared to in fiscal and in fiscal the effective income tax rate was lower in fiscal than fiscal primarily as a result of the realization of a million tax benefit in fiscal for certain state net operating losses that previously had not been benefited 
see note  income taxes in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following policies are considered by management to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flows 

table of contents inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory cost is determined using the last in  first out lifo method for a portion of us owned inventory approximately and of total inventories at august  and  respectively 
the first in  first out or average cost method is used for all other inventories 
if the lifo method were not used  the inventory balance would be higher than the amount in the consolidated balance sheet by approximately million at both august  and the company performs an analysis of the historical sales usage of the individual inventory items on hand and a reserve is recorded to adjust inventory cost to market value 
the inventory valuation assumptions used are based on historical experience 
the company believes that such estimates are made with consistent and appropriate methods  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
goodwill and long lived assets the company s goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the company performs impairment reviews for its reporting units using a fair value method based on management s judgments and assumptions 
the fair value represents the amount at which a reporting unit could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties on an arms length basis 
in estimating the fair value  the company uses discounted cash flow 
the estimated fair value is then compared with the carrying amount of the reporting unit  including goodwill 
independent appraisers are retained to perform additional fair value calculations in situations where the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds our fair value calculations 
the company is subject to financial statement risk to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value 
the impairment testing performed by the company at august  indicated that the estimated fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its corresponding carrying amount  and  as such  no impairment existed 
indefinite lived intangible assets are subject to annual impairment testing  as well 
on an annual basis  the fair value of the indefinite lived assets are evaluated by the company to determine if an impairment charge is required 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
if such indicators are present  the company performs undiscounted operating cash flow analyses to determine if an impairment exists 
if an impairment is determined to exist  any related impairment loss is calculated based on fair value 
a considerable amount of management judgment and assumptions are required in performing the impairment tests  principally in determining the fair value of each reporting unit and the indefinite lived intangible assets 
while the company believes its judgments and assumptions were reasonable  different assumptions could change the estimated fair values and  therefore  impairment charges could be required 
employee benefit plans the company provides a variety of benefits to its employees  including in some cases  pensions and postretirement health care 
plan assets and obligations are recorded based on the company s measurement date utilizing various actuarial assumptions such as discount rates  assumed rates of return  and health care cost trend rates as of that date 
the discount rate used by the company is based on the interest rate of noncallable high quality corporate bonds  with appropriate consideration of local market factors for foreign benefit plans and the company s benefit plans participants demographics and benefit payment terms 
at august  and  the company s weighted average discount rate on domestic benefit plans was and  respectively 
a change in the discount rate by basis points would impact the company s domestic benefit plan expense in fiscal year by less than million 
at august  and  the company s weighted average discount rate on foreign benefit plans was and  respectively 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  the company considers the historical returns on plan assets  adjusted for forward looking considerations  inflation assumptions and the impact of the management of the plans invested assets 
domestic benefit plan assets consist primarily of participating units in common stock  index funds  and bond funds 
the company assumed its expected return on domestic benefit plan assets to be at both august  and a basis point change in this assumption would impact fiscal domestic benefit plan expense by less than million 
due to the low amount of foreign benefit plan assets  the expected return on plan assets does not materially impact the company s results of operations 

table of contents the company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications based on current rates and trends when appropriate 
as required by us gaap  the effects of the modifications are recorded currently or amortized over future periods 
based on information provided by its independent actuaries and other relevant sources  the company believes that the assumptions used are reasonable  however  changes in these assumptions could impact the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
see note  employee benefit plans for further discussion 
income taxes the company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and other loss carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
income tax expense recognized by the company also reflects its best estimates and assumptions regarding  among other things  the level of future taxable income and effect of the company s various tax planning strategies 
future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws  changes in projected levels of taxable income  and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the company 
use of estimates the company has recorded reserves or allowances for customer returns and discounts  doubtful accounts  inventory  incurred but not reported medical claims  environmental issues  warranty claims  workers compensation claims  product and non product litigation  and incentive compensation 
these reserves require the use of estimates and judgment 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the company believes that such estimates are made with consistent and appropriate methods 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
liquidity and capital resources the company reported cash provided from operating activities of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in fiscal results from increased profitability and improved primary working capital management 
the company increased the accounts receivable sold under the securitization program by approximately million to million at august  compared to million at august  fiscal cash provided by operating activities increased as compared to fiscal due to our focus on working capital management and the partial year benefit of cash generated by businesses acquired in fiscal  offset by the million tax refund paid to a former subsidiary in cash provided by operating activities is primarily used to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to reduce debt 
cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively  primarily consisting of business acquisitions

net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in fiscal consisting primarily of proceeds from term loans and the million senior note offering  offset by principal repayments on term loans 
net cash provided by fiscal financing activities totaled million consisting primarily of revolving credit borrowings to fund acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in fiscal consisting primarily of funds raised to finance acquisitions 
in fiscal  we completed an amendment to our senior credit facility to provide for a new million term loan 
we also generated net proceeds of million from the sale of previously unissued class a common stock 
the equity offering proceeds were used to call and retire million including premium of senior notes assumed in the kci acquisition and pay down revolving credit borrowings 
at august   we had approximately million of availability under our bank revolving credit line 
we believe that such availability  combined with our existing cash on hand and funds generated from operations  will be adequate to meet operating  debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 

table of contents primary working capital management we use primary working capital pwc as a percentage of sales as a key indicator of working capital management 
we define this metric as the sum of net accounts receivable  outstanding balances on the accounts receivable securitization facility  and net inventory less accounts payable  divided by the past three months sales annualized 
the following table shows the components of the metric amounts in millions august  august  pwc pwc accounts receivable  net accounts receivable securitization total accounts receivable inventory  net accounts payable net primary working capital our net primary working capital percentage declined year over year from to  reflecting our success in better managing working capital 
our accounts receivable percentage decreased from to due to shorter collection cycles 
inventory as a percentage of sales has remained unchanged between periods  while accounts payable levels as a percentage of sales have increased as we continue to negotiate longer vendor terms 
seasonality and working capital we have met our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through a combination of operating cash flow and availability under our accounts receivable securitization and revolving credit facility 
although there are modest seasonal factors within certain of our businesses  on a consolidated basis  we do not experience material changes in seasonal working capital or capital resource requirements 
our receivables are derived from a diverse customer base in a number of industries 
we have no single customer which generated or greater of fiscal net sales 
capital expenditures the majority of our manufacturing activities consist of the assembly of components which are sourced from a variety of vendors 
we believe that our capital expenditure requirements are not as extensive as many other industrial companies given the assembly nature of our operations 
capital expenditures for the fiscal years ended august    and were million  million  and million  respectively 
capital expenditures have historically been funded by operating cash flows and borrowings under revolving credit facilities 
for the past three fiscal years  capital expenditures were invested primarily in machinery  equipment  and computer systems 
capital expenditures for fiscal are estimated to increase to million  reflecting higher expenditures related to a new facility in china  erp system installations  and general business expansion 
commitments and contingencies the company leases certain facilities  computers  equipment and vehicles under various operating lease agreements  generally over periods from one to twenty years 
under most arrangements  the company pays the property taxes  insurance  maintenance and expenses related to the leased property 
many of the leases include provisions that enable the company to renew the lease based upon fair value rental rates on the date of expiration of the initial lease 
see note  leases  in the notes to consolidated financial statements and the timing of 
table of contents commitments table below for further information 
the company is contingently liable for certain lease agreements held by businesses included in its former electronics segment  which was spun off to shareholders in fiscal some of these businesses were subsequently sold to third parties 
if any of these businesses do not fulfill their obligations under the leases  the company could be liable for such leases 
the present value of future minimum lease payments for such leases totals approximately million at august  the future undiscounted minimum lease payments for these leases are as follows million in the balance of calendar  million in each of calendar  calendar  calendar and calendar  and an aggregate million thereafter 
as more fully discussed in note  accounts receivable securitization in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are a party to an accounts receivable securitization arrangement 
trade receivables sold and being serviced by the company were million and million at august  and  respectively 
if we were to discontinue this securitization program  at august  we would have been required to borrow approximately million to finance the increase in working capital 
total capacity under the program is million 
we had outstanding letters of credit of million at both august  and the majority of the letters of credit secure self insured workers compensation liabilities 
timing of commitments the timing of payments due under our contractual commitments is as follows contractual obligations a years ended august  long term debt obligations operating lease obligations b total amounts in millions thereafter total a the above table excludes the additional payments for acquisition earn out payments  as the exact amount and timing of payments is not known 
the company made earn out payments on past acquisitions totaling   and million in fiscal   and  respectively 
for further information see note  acquisitions 
in addition  interest payments on debt obligations are not included in the above table 
b the company s purchase obligations generally relate to amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for real estate leases  information technology services  including software and hardware support services and leases  and telecommunications services 
those purchase obligations  such as leases  that are not cancelable are included in the table 
the company routinely issues purchase orders to numerous vendors for the purchase of inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are generally cancelable with reasonable notice to the vendor  and as such  they are excluded from the contractual obligations table 
raw material costs and inflation we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials  such as steel  plastic resin  and copper  are subject to price fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on the company s results 
the 
table of contents company strives to pass along such commodity price increases to customers to avoid profit margin erosion and utilize lead initiatives further mitigate the impact of commodity raw material price fluctuations as improved efficiencies across all locations are achieved 
we also selectively utilize commodity derivative contracts to hedge against changing raw material prices 
the company did not have any significant derivative contracts in place at august    or to hedge its exposure to commodity risk 
see our risk factors for additional information on the company s commodity risks 
no meaningful measures of inflation are available because we have significant operations in countries with diverse rates of inflation and currency rate movements 
however  we believe that the overall rate of inflation in recent years has been relatively low and has not had a significant effect on our results of operations

s and  and improves the financial reporting of certain hybrid financial instruments by requiring more consistent accounting that eliminates exemptions and provides a means to simplify the accounting for these instruments 
specifically  sfas no 
allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued by the company after the beginning of fiscal we do not anticipate any impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the way companies are to account for uncertainty in income tax reporting and filing and prescribes a consistent recognition threshold and measurement attribute for recognizing  derecognizing  and measuring the tax benefits of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  on a tax return 
any change in net assets as a result of adopting the new standard is required to be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment to the company s opening retained earnings balance as of september  while the company is continuing to evaluate the impact of this interpretation and guidance on its application  it currently estimates the adoption of fin will increase the amount recorded by the company for uncertain tax positions by approximately million

could have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and  to a lesser extent  commodities 
to reduce such risks  we selectively use financial instruments and other proactive management techniques 
all hedging transactions are authorized and executed pursuant to clearly defined policies and procedures  which strictly prohibit the use of financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments is included within note  summary of significant accounting policies in notes to consolidated financial statements 
currency risk we have exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
approximately   and of our revenues for the years ended august   and  respectively  were denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
of those us dollar denominated amounts  approximately   and  respectively  were denominated in euro  with the remainder denominated in british pounds and various asian and other currencies 
we selectively use cross currency interest rate swaps to hedge the foreign currency exposure associated with our net investment in certain foreign operations net investment hedges 
under the swaps  we receive interest based on a variable us dollar rate and pay interest based on variable euro rates on the outstanding notional principal amounts in dollars and euro 
foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded as a component of shareholders equity 
our identifiable foreign currency exchange exposure results primarily from the anticipated purchase of product from affiliates and third party suppliers and from the repayment of intercompany loans between subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
we periodically identify areas where it does not have naturally occurring offsetting positions and then may purchase hedging instruments to protect against anticipated exposures 
there are no material hedging instruments in place as of the date of this filing 
our financial position is not materially sensitive to fluctuations in exchange rates as any gains or losses on foreign currency exposures are generally offset by gains and losses on underlying payables  receivables and net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk we have earnings exposure related to interest rate changes on our outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are based on libor and euribor interest rates 
we have periodically utilized interest rate swap agreements to manage overall financing costs and interest rate risk 
at august   we were a party to interest rate swap agreements that converts million of floating rate debt to a fixed rate of interest 
a basis point increase or decrease in the applicable interest rates on our unhedged variable rate debt at august  would result in a change in pre tax interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
commodity risk we source a wide variety of materials and components from a network of global suppliers 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials  such as steel  plastic resin  and copper  are subject to price fluctuations  which could have a negative impact on our results 
we strive to pass along such commodity price increases to customers to avoid profit margin erosion and utilize lead initiatives further mitigate the impact of commodity raw material price fluctuations as improved efficiencies across all locations are achieved 
we also selectively utilize commodity derivative contracts to hedge against changing raw material prices 
we did not have any significant derivative contracts in place at august   or to hedge exposure to commodity risk
