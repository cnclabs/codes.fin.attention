during  we commenced the implementation of a global strategy that the company believes will  in the long run  result in certain operational benefits as well as provide the company with a lower annual effective tax rate that is lower than if we did not pursue this strategy 
our strategy involves an increased investment in technology and headcount outside the united states in order to better align asset ownership and business functions with our expectations related to the sources  timing and amounts of future revenues and profits 
as a result of undertaking these efforts  the company anticipates an annual effective tax rate in to be in the to range which is materially higher than our combined federal  state and foreign statutory tax rate of approximately 
assuming implementation of our global strategy  we expect our annual effective tax rate for to decline to a range of to 
longer term  we expect that our income tax rate will decline from that level 
see risk factors there are risks to our global strategy 
on january   we completed our acquisition of sci worx  an intellectual property and design service provider specializing in multimedia  communications  and networking applications 
we purchased sci worx gmbh  from infineon 
we purchased all of the outstanding shares of capital stock of sci worx and paid sci worx s intercompany debt to another infineon subsidiary 
the purchase price for the acquisition was million in cash for sci worx capital stock and its intercompany debt net of its cash balances at closing 
the newly acquired company is now referred to as silicon image germany and has approximately employees  based in hanover  germany 
as a result of the acquisition  we expect our costs to increase primarily due to growth in acquired headcount and related expenses 
on february   we entered into a video processor design license agreement with sunplus 
under the terms of the license agreement  silicon image will receive a license to use and further develop advanced video processor technology 
the license agreement provides for the payment of an aggregate of million to sunplus by silicon image  million of which is payable in consideration for the licensed technology and related deliverables and million of which is payable in consideration for sunplus support and maintenance obligations 
we paid sunplus million of the consideration for the licensed technology and related deliverables in february  and are required to pay the remaining million upon delivery and completion of certain milestones 
the million to be paid for support and maintenance by sunplus is payable over a two year period starting upon delivery of the final sunplus deliverables 
the license agreement also provides for the grant to sunplus 
table of contents of a license to certain of our intellectual property  for which sunplus has agreed to pay us million upon delivery and acceptance of such intellectual property 
we anticipate that the technology licensed from sunplus  along with the engineering talent and intellectual property recently acquired in the sci worx transaction  will enhance and accelerate our ability to develop and offer a broader array of consumer product offerings  ranging from discrete hdmi chips to new integrated front end dtv input processors and fully integrated soc dtv products 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and all known facts and circumstances that we believe are relevant 
actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain revenue recognition for products sold directly to end users  or to distributors that do not receive price concessions and do not have rights of return  we recognize revenue upon shipment and title transfer if we believe collection is reasonably assured 
reserves for sales returns are estimated based primarily on historical experience and are provided at the time of shipment 
the amount of sales returns and allowances has not been  and is not expected to be  material 
the majority of our products are sold to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and product returns 
we recognize revenue based on our best estimate of when the distributor sold the product to its end customer based on point of sales reports received from our distributors 
due to the timing of receipt of these reports  we recognize distributor sell through using information that lags quarter end by one month 
revenue is not recognized upon shipment since  due to various forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount for a given period of time 
revenue is earned when the distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time our sales price to the distributor becomes fixed 
our revenue is highly dependent on receiving pertinent and accurate data from our distributors in a timely fashion 
distributors provide us periodic data regarding the product  price  quantity  and end customer shipments as well as the quantities of our products they still have in stock 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  we use this data and apply judgment in reconciling differences between their reported inventories and activities 
if distributors incorrectly report their inventories or activities  or if our judgment is in error  it could lead to inaccurate reporting of our revenues and income 
we have controls in place to minimize the likelihood of this occurrence  but there is no absolute assurance that this will not occur 
pursuant to our distributor agreements  older or end of life products are sold with no right of return and are not eligible for price concessions 
certain of our distributor agreements for new products also contain provisions that do not allow for product returns or price concessions 
for these products  revenue is recognized upon shipment and title transfer assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to payment  relieve inventory for the carrying value of goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor  and record the gross margin in deferred margin on sale to distributors  a component of current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
deferred margin on the sale to distributor effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor 
however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods will be less than the originally recorded deferred margin on sale to distributor as a result of negotiated price concessions 
we sell each item in our product price book to all of our distributors worldwide at a relatively uniform list price 
however  distributors resell our products to end customers at a very broad range of individually negotiated price points based on customer  product  quantity  geography  competitive pricing  and other factors 
the majority of our 
table of contents distributors resale are priced at a discount from list price 
often  under these circumstances  we remit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is completed 
thus  a substantial portion of the deferred margin on the sale to distributor and related allowances on sales to distributors balance represents a portion of distributors original purchase price that will be remitted back to the distributor in the future 
the wide range and variability of negotiated price concessions granted to distributors does not allow us to accurately estimate the portion of the balance in the deferred margin on the sale to distributor and related allowances on sales to distributors that will be remitted back to the distributors 
we do reduce deferred income by anticipated or determinable future price concessions 
license revenue is recognized when an agreement with a licensee exists  the price is fixed or determinable  delivery or performance has occurred  and collection is reasonably assured 
generally  we expect to meet these criteria and recognize revenue at the time we deliver the agreed upon items 
however  we may defer recognition of revenue until either cash is received if collection is not reasonably assured at the time of delivery or  in the event that the arrangement includes undelivered elements for which the fair value cannot be determined  until the earlier of such time that the fair value can be determined or the elements are delivered 
the fair value of undelivered elements is generally based upon the price charged when the elements are sold separately 
a number of our license agreements require customer acceptance of deliverables  in which case we would defer recognition of revenue until the licensee has accepted the deliverables and either payment has been received or is expected within days of acceptance 
certain licensing agreements provide for royalty payments based on agreed upon royalty rates 
such rates can be fixed or variable depending on the terms of the agreement 
the amount of revenue we recognize is determined based on a time period or on the agreed upon royalty rate  extended by the number of units shipped by the customer 
to determine the number of units shipped  we rely upon actual royalty reports from our customers when available  and rely upon estimates in lieu of actual royalty reports when we have a sufficient history of receiving royalties from a specific customer for us to make an estimate based on available information from the licensee such as quantities held  manufactured and other information 
these estimates for royalties necessarily involve the application of management judgment 
as a result of our use of estimates  period to period numbers are trued up in the following period to reflect actual units shipped 
to date  such true up adjustments have not been significant 
in cases where royalty reports and other information are not available to allow us to estimate royalty revenue  we recognize revenue only when royalty reports are received 
revenues from such licenses are recognized proportionately as we perform services 
on certain arrangements  revenues derived from development services are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
for all license and service agreements accounted for using the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion using input measures based on labor hours incurred 
our license revenue recognition depends upon many factors including development project status  completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items and customer acceptances 
cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash equivalents consist of short term  highly liquid financial instruments with insignificant interest rate risk that are readily convertible to cash and have maturities of three months or less from the date of purchase 
short term investments consist of taxable commercial paper  united states government agency obligations  corporate municipal notes and bonds with high credit quality  money market preferred stock and auction rate preferred stock and have maturities greater than three months from the date of purchase 
the fair market value  based on quoted market prices  of cash equivalents and short term investments 
cost of securities sold is based on a specific identification method 
in determining if and when a decline in market value below cost of these investments is other than temporary  the company evaluates the market conditions  offering prices  trends of earnings  price multiples and other key measures 
when such a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  the company recognizes an impairment loss in the current period operating results to the extent of the decline 
allowance for doubtful accounts we review collectibility of accounts receivable on an on going basis and provide an allowance for amounts we estimate will not be collectible 
during our review  we consider our historical experience  the age of the receivable balance  the credit worthiness of the customer  and the reason for the delinquency 
delinquent account balances are 
table of contents written off after management has determined that the likelihood of collection is remote 
write offs to date have not been material 
at december   we had million of gross accounts receivable and an allowance for doubtful accounts of  while we endeavor to accurately estimate the allowance  we may record unanticipated write offs in the future 
inventories we record inventories at the lower of actual cost  determined on a first in first out fifo basis  or market 
actual cost approximates standard cost  adjusted for variances between standard and actual 
standard costs are determined based on our estimate of material costs  manufacturing yields  costs to assemble  test and package our products  and allocable indirect costs 
we record differences between standard costs and actual costs as variances 
these variances are analyzed and are either included on the consolidated balance sheet or the consolidated statement of operations in order to state the inventories at actual costs on a fifo basis 
standard costs are evaluated at least annually 
provisions are recorded for excess and obsolete inventory  and are estimated based on a comparison of the quantity and cost of inventory on hand to management s forecast of customer demand 
customer demand is dependent on many factors and requires us to use significant judgment in our forecasting process 
we must also make assumptions regarding the rate at which new products will be accepted in the marketplace and at which customers will transition from older products to newer products 
generally  inventories in excess of six months demand are written down to zero and the related provision is recorded as a cost of revenue 
once a provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of  even if in subsequent periods we forecast demand for the product 
goodwill and intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standard no 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible 
this standard requires that goodwill be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is highly subjective and requires significant management judgment to forecast future operating results  projected cash flows and current period market capitalization levels 
in estimating the fair value of the business  we make estimates and judgments about the future cash flows 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage our business  there is significant judgment in determining such future cash flows 
we also consider market capitalization on the date we perform the analysis 
based on our annual impairment test performed for  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
however  there can be no assurance that we will not incur charges for impairment of goodwill in the future  which could adversely affect our earnings 
income taxes we must make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of tax credits  tax benefits  and deductions such as the tax benefit for export sales and in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period 
deferred tax assets we account for income taxes using an asset and liability approach  which requires recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements  but have not been reflected in our taxable income 
in general  a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to their estimated realizable value  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
prior to  we had provided a valuation allowance against of our net deferred tax assets 
in  we determined that our net deferred tax assets as of december  are more likely than not to be realized 
therefore  in  we released the 
table of contents remaining valuation allowance of approximately million that had reduced the carrying value of our deferred tax assets as of december  approximately million of the valuation allowance release relates to prior years windfall tax benefits on employee stock transactions that were included in the deferred tax asset for net operating loss carryforwards as of december  this portion of the valuation allowance release was recorded as a direct increase to additional paid in capital instead of a reduction to the tax provision 
at december   we had gross deferred tax assets  related primarily to stock based compensation  accruals and reserves that are not currently deductible  and tax credit carry forwards of million 
at december  our gross deferred tax assets of million consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards  and stock based compensation not currently deductible for tax purposes 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly and will continue to assess the need for additional valuation allowances  if any 
accrued liabilities certain of our accrued liabilities are based largely on estimates 
for instance  we record a liability on our consolidated balance sheet each period for the estimated cost of goods and services rendered to us  for which we have not received an invoice 
our estimates are based on historical experience  input from sources outside the company  and other relevant facts and circumstances 
actual amounts could differ materially from these estimates 
certain of our licensing agreements require that we indemnify our customers for expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of patent  trademark or copyright by third parties related to intellectual property content of our products 
certain of these indemnification provisions are perpetual from execution of the agreement and  in some instances the maximum amount of potential future indemnification is not limited 
to date  we have not paid any such claims or been required to defend any lawsuits with respect to a claim 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r  requiring us to recognize expense related to the fair value of our stock based compensation awards 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no 
r and therefore have not restated our financial results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 as adjusted for estimated forfeitures 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to december  was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  our espp is considered a compensatory plan and we are required to recognize compensation cost for grants made under the espp 
we recognize compensation expense on a straight line basis for all share based payment awards over the respective requisite service period of the awards 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
requires that management determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
once it is determined that a position meets this recognition threshold  the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
we expect to adopt the provisions of fin no

sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
sab provides that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
the guidance in sab must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  we have adopted sab  and have considered its provisions in the preparation of our current financial statements and related disclosures and  as of december   it did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

the increase in the ce product revenue was due primarily to strong sales volumes of hdmi receivers and transmitters

revenue from our dvi products are expected to decline in the future as dvi technology is replaced by hdmi and displayport 
the decrease in storage product revenue was due to the trend of declining sales of our legacy storage systems products  which are being phased out of customer applications  partially offset by contributions from our new sata and steelvine products 
we have experienced erosion of average selling prices for all of our product categories 
we expect average selling prices to continue to decline in the first quarter of we license our technology in each of our areas of business  but usually limit the scope of the license to market areas that are complementary to our product sales and do not directly compete with our direct product offerings

we expect revenues from dvi products to decline in the future as it is replaced by hdmi and displayport standards 
while revenues grew in absolute dollars  our pc product revenues were negatively affected by battery recalls by major computer manufacturers as well as the late launch of windows vista operating system 
licensing revenues included in our revenues from the pc market increased substantially in due to the recognition of royalty revenues related to the settlement agreement with genesis

demand for our storage semiconductor products is dependent upon the rate at which interface technology transitions from parallel to serial  market acceptance of our steelvine architecture  and the extent to which sata is integrated into chipsets and controllers offered by other companies  which would make our discrete devices unnecessary 
in  we anticipate our legacy storage semiconductor business and pata revenues to continue decreasing as our steelvine revenues are projected to increase 
our licensing activity is complementary to our product sales and it helps us to monetize our intellectual property and accelerate market adoption curves associated with our technology

see detailed discussion under part i item legal proceedings 
licensing contracts are complex and depend upon many factors including completion of milestones  allocation of values to delivered items  and customer acceptances 
although we attempt to make these factors predictable  many of these factors require significant judgments 
commitments  contingencies and concentrations historically  a relatively small number of customers and distributors have generated a significant portion of our revenue 
for instance  our top five customers  including distributors  generated   and of our revenue in   and  respectively 
the percentage of revenue generated through distributors tends to be significant  since many oem s rely upon third party manufacturers or distributors to provide purchasing and inventory management functions 
in  of our revenue was generated through distributors  compared to in and in microtek comprised   and of our revenue in   and  respectively 
innotech corporation  comprised  and of our revenue in  and respectively 
world peace inc  comprised  and of our revenue in  and respectively 
our licensing revenue is not generated through distributors  and to the extent licensing revenue increases  we would expect a decrease in the percentage of our revenue generated through distributors 
a significant portion of our revenue is generated from products sold overseas 
sales including licensing to customers in asia  including distributors  generated   and of our revenue in  and  respectively 
the reason for our geographical concentration in asia is that most of our products are incorporated into flat panel displays  graphic cards and motherboards  the majority of which are manufactured in asia 
the percentage of our revenue derived from any country is dependent upon where our end customers choose to manufacture their products 
accordingly  variability in our geographic revenue is not necessarily indicative of any geographic trends  but rather is the combined effect of new design wins and changes in customer manufacturing locations 
all revenue to date has been denominated in us dollars 
cost of revenue and gross margin change change dollars in thousands cost of revenue total gross margin gross margin as a percentage of total revenue includes stock based compensation expense benefit 
table of contents cost of revenue consists primarily of costs incurred to manufacture  assemble and test our products  as well as related overhead costs 
gross margin revenue minus cost of revenue  as a percentage of revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin from to was primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense of million under fas r share based payment as compared to the stock compensation benefit of million recorded in under apb accounting for stock issued to employees  erosion in the average selling prices of our products as a result of increased competition  and to a lesser extent by higher overhead expenses as a result of increase in headcount and related compensation 
in  we expect continued competitive pressures to continue to reduce our average selling prices 
however  we plan to mitigate this average selling price erosion through cost reductions and new product launches with expected higher margins 
also as a result of the sci worx acquisition  we expect our gross margins to be adversely affected in the first quarter of by silicon image germany s existing design services activities and other customer programs which are currently charged against cost of revenue 
we expect that the effect of the sci worx acquisition on our gross margins will decline over time as silicon image germany shifts its focus to new product development  which will be charged to research and development expenses 
the increase in gross margin from to was due to recognition of stock based compensation benefit of million in as compared to stock based compensation expense of million in the net change in stock based compensation expense was partially offset by million less in licensing revenue  which have a disproportionate impact on gross profit compared to product sales  erosion in the average selling prices of our products  and higher overhead expenses

in addition  the increase also reflected increased use of consultants and the number of r d projects and lower credit to expense from engineering projects funded by outside parties 
while continuing to honor and support existing contract obligations assumed in connection with our acquisition of silicon image germany  over time  we expect our r d expense to increase as silicon image germany shifts its focus to new product development 

table of contents the decrease in from was primarily due to the recognition of stock compensation benefit of million in as compared to stock based compensation expense of million in as well as the benefit from a credit to expense of approximately million related to three engineering projects that are being funded by outside parties  irrespective of the results of the projects 
these items were partially offset by an increase in the number of r d projects as well higher salaries and wages resulting from an increased number of engineers on staff

the tax charges related to unbenefited foreign losses represent expenses for sharing in the costs of our ongoing research and development efforts as well as licensing commercial rights to exploit pre existing intangibles to better align with customers outside the americas 
the new global strategy is designed to better align asset ownership and business functions with our expectations related to the sources  timing and amounts of future revenues and profits 
in future years  we expect to achieve both operational benefits and a lower annual effective tax rate as a result of the new global strategy

please refer to note subsequent events to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion

on february   we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program under which we intend  from time to time  as business conditions warrant  to purchase up to million of common stock  on the open market  or in negotiated or block transactions 
purchases may be increased  decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice 
as of march   no shares had yet been repurchased under this stock repurchase program 
debt and lease obligations in november  we leased certain capital equipment under a lease arrangement accounted for as a capital lease 
the remaining principal balance was repaid during and there was no outstanding principal balance outstanding under this lease arrangement as of december  the principal balance outstanding under this arrangement as of december  was approximately  in december  we entered into a non cancelable operating lease renewal for our principal operating facility  including an additional  square feet of space in an adjacent building  that commenced in august and expires in july in june  the lease terms were amended and we leased approximately  square feet of additional space for a total leased area of approximately  square feet 
the revised agreement provides for a rent free period for the additional space and thereafter initial base monthly rental payments of  and provides for annual increases of thereafter 
as a result of the lease modification we recorded an adjustment of  to the restructuring accrual with an offsetting reduction of our operating expense for the year ended december  in may  we entered into an amendment to the operating lease agreement 
the amendment expanded the leased premises to include approximately  square feet of space in an adjacent building 
the lease expiration was extended to july and the monthly rental payments are  with annual increases of thereafter 

table of contents in june  in connection with our acquisition of cmd  we acquired the lease of an operating facility in irvine  california with average monthly rental payments of approximately  through november we subleased parts of this facility to three separate third parties 
these sublease agreements were co terminous leases and expired in november these subleases collectively generated monthly sublease income of approximately  to offset our payments 
effective december  the original lease was terminated and we entered into a new non cancelable operating lease agreement through november under the terms of the new agreement  base monthly rental lease payments of  are required and increases annually thereafter 
we also lease office space in china  germany  japan  korea  taiwan  turkey and united kingdom 
rent expense totaled million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
future minimum lease payments under operating leases have not been reduced by expected sublease rental income or by the amount of our restructuring accrual that relates to leased facilities 
future minimum payments for our software license commitments  operating leases  inventory and other purchase commitments and minimum royalty obligations at december  are as follows in thousands payments due in less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations software license commitments operating lease obligations inventory purchase commitments minimum royalty obligation total based on our estimated cash flows  we believe our existing cash and short term investments are sufficient to meet our capital and operating requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we expect to continue to invest in property and equipment in the ordinary course of business 
our future operating and capital requirements depend on many factors  including the levels at which we generate product revenue and related margins  the extent to which we generate cash through stock option exercises and proceeds from sales of shares under our employee stock purchase plan  the timing and extent of development  licensing and royalty revenue  investments in inventory  property  plant and equipment and accounts receivable  the cost of securing access to adequate manufacturing capacity  our operating expenses  including legal and patent assertion costs  and general economic conditions 
in addition  cash may be required for future acquisitions should we choose to pursue any 
while  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances together with income derived from sales of our products and licensing will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements in the foreseeable future  to the extent existing resources and cash from operations are insufficient to support our activities  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing 
these funds may not be available when we need them  or if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to us 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term and long term investments in a variety of securities  including government and corporate securities and money market funds 
these securities are classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
all investments mature within one year from the date of purchase 
we also limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines of our fixed income portfolios 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 
due to the limited duration and 
table of contents credit risk criteria established in our guidelines we do not expect the exposure to interest rate risk and credit risk to be material 
if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of december  this sensitivity analysis was based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus   or basis points over a twelve month time horizon 
the following represents the potential decrease to the value of our investments given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
as of december   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities as reported in short term investments  including those classified as cash equivalents of approximately million 
these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations 
the following represents the potential decrease to the value of our fixed income securities given a negative shift in the yield curve used in our sensitivity analysis 
foreign currency exchange risk all of our sales are denominated in us dollars  and substantially all of our expenses are incurred in us dollars  thus limiting our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company s objective for holding derivatives is to minimize foreign currency exposure associated with foreign currency denominated transactions 
the company does not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign currency exchange rates may impact our future operating results or cash flows as any such increases in our currency exchange rate may result in increased wafer  packaging  assembly or testing costs as well as ongoing operating activities in our foreign operations 
additionally  many of our foreign distributors price our products in the local currency of the countries in which they sell 
therefore  significant strengthening of the us dollar relative to those foreign currencies could result in reduced demand or lower us dollar prices for our products  which would negatively affect our operating results 
in december  we entered into a forward exchange contracts in connection with the sci worx acquisition  with an aggregate notional amount of million euros  or approximately million based upon the exchange rate at december  the effect of an immediate adverse change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts would result in an approximate million loss
