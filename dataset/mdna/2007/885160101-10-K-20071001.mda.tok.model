item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview we were founded in and have grown to be the largest manufacturer of recreation vehicles rvs and a major manufacturer of commercial buses in north america 
our market share in the travel trailer and fifth wheel segment of the industry towables  is approximately 
in the motorized segment of the industry we have a market share of approximately 
our market share in small and mid size buses is approximately 
we also manufacture and sell foot buses at our facility in southern california designed for that product as well as our existing foot and foot buses 
our growth has been internal and by acquisition 
our strategy has been to increase our profitability in north america in the recreation vehicle industry and in the bus business through product innovation  service to our customers  manufacturing quality products  improving our facilities and acquisitions 
we have not entered unrelated businesses and have no plans to do so in the future 
we rely on internally generated cash flows from operations to finance our growth although we may borrow to make an acquisition if we believe the incremental cash flows will provide for rapid payback 
we have invested significant capital to modernize and expand our plant facilities and expended  for that purpose in fiscal our business model includes decentralized operating units and we compensate operating management primarily with cash based upon profitability of the unit which they manage 
our corporate staff provides financial management  centralized purchasing services  insurance  legal and human resources  risk management  and internal audit functions 
senior corporate management interacts regularly with operating management to assure that corporate objectives are understood clearly and are monitored appropriately 
our rv products are sold to dealers who  in turn  retail those products 
our buses are sold through dealers to municipalities and private purchasers such as rental car companies and hotels 
we do not directly finance dealers but do provide repurchase agreements in order to facilitate the dealers obtaining floor plan financing 
we have a joint venture  thor credit  operated by ge consumer finance  which provides retail credit to ultimate purchasers of any recreation vehicle purchased from a thor dealer 
this retail credit on recreation vehicles is not limited to thor products only 

table of contents restatement on january   we announced that the audit committee of our board of directors the audit committee initiated an independent investigation regarding certain accounting issues at our dutchmen manufacturing  inc operating subsidiary dutchmen  primarily involving inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and cost of products sold 
we promptly and voluntarily informed the sec of the audit committee s investigation  and have been responding to sec staff requests for additional information in connection with the staff s investigation 
the audit committee  assisted by independent outside legal counsel and accounting experts  thoroughly investigated the accounting issues raised at dutchmen 
the audit committee and its advisors also reviewed the internal controls at dutchmen and other subsidiaries 
on april   we announced that on april  our board of directors  acting upon the recommendation of the audit committee and management  concluded that our previously issued consolidated financial statements relating to the fiscal years  and and the three months ended october  contained in our filings with the sec  including related reports of our independent registered public accounting firm  deloitte touche llp  and press releases  should no longer be relied upon 
upon completing their investigation  the audit committee s independent advisors presented the findings and recommendations of the investigation to the company s board of directors on april  and april  and to the sec staff on may  the audit committee s investigation confirmed the company s determination that income before income taxes recorded by dutchmen was overstated in the amount of approximately  in the aggregate from fiscal year to the second quarter of fiscal year  as a result of misconduct by dutchmen s former vice president of finance  the senior financial officer of dutchmen in which he intentionally understated the cost of products sold 
dutchmen s vice president of finance manipulated accounts reflecting inventory  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and cost of products sold  by entering and approving his own inaccurate journal entries as well as reconciling the related accounts  and prepared fraudulent supporting documentation  with the net effect of overstating dutchmen s income before income taxes by approximately  during the relevant period 
the audit committee s investigation found no evidence to conclude that anyone else  at dutchmen or elsewhere in the company  knew of or participated in this misconduct or that there was theft or misappropriation of company assets 
the audit committee s investigation also identified issues with respect to internal controls at dutchmen  certain of the company s other operating subsidiaries  and the company s corporate finance and accounting office 
the company decided to restate its previously issued financial statements as of july  and  and for each of the years in the three year period ended july   and the financial results in each of the quarterly periods in and  and the financial statements as of and for the three months ended october   following the company s evaluation  considering the results from the audit committee s investigation  of accounting practices employed at dutchmen during these periods 
the accompanying management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations gives effect to the restatement 
we have incurred expenses of  in fiscal as a direct result of the audit committee s investigation and the company s review of the accounting practices at dutchmen and certain of our other operating subsidiaries 
these costs primarily relate to professional services for legal  accounting and tax guidance 
in addition  we have incurred costs related to the preparation  review and audit of our restated consolidated financial statements 
we expect that we will continue to incur costs associated with these matters 
trends and business outlook the most important determinant of demand for recreation vehicles is demographics 
the baby boomer population is now reaching retirement age and retirees are a large market for our products 
the baby boomer retiree population in the united states is expected to grow five times as fast as the total united states population 
we believe a primary indicator of the strength of the recreation vehicle industry is retail rv sales  which we closely monitor to determine industry trends 
recently  the towable segment of the rv industry has been stronger than the motorized segment 
for the towable segment  retail sales as reported by statistical surveys  inc were up approximately for the seven months ended july  compared with the same period last year 
the motorized segment was down approximately 
higher interest rates and fuel prices appear to affect the motorized segment more severely 
government entities are primary users of our buses 
demand in this segment is subject to fluctuations in government spending on transit 
in addition  hotel and rental car companies are also major users of our small and mid size buses and therefore airline travel is an important indicator for this market 
the majority of our buses have a year useful life and are being continuously replaced by operators 
according to mid size bus manufacturers association unit sales of small and mid sized buses are up for the six months ended june  compared with the same period last year 

table of contents economic or industry wide factors affecting our recreation vehicle business include raw material costs of commodities used in the manufacture of our product 
material cost is the primary factor determining our cost of products sold 
additional increases in raw material costs would impact our profit margins negatively if we were unable to raise prices for our products by corresponding amounts

this change was based on the company s decision to change its investment strategy from one of generating profits on short term differences in price to one of preserving capital 
at july   all investments short term are comprised of auction rate securities that are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the company purchases its auction rate securities at par  which either mature or reset at par  and generally there are no unrealized or realized gains or losses to report 
cost is determined on the specific identification basis 
interest income is accrued as earned 
all of the available for sale securities held at july  mature within one year 
as of july   the company held short term debt and equity investments classified as trading securities 
these trading securities were all sold or matured during the three months ended october  and were recorded as trading securities activity 
realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in earnings 
dividend and interest income were recognized when earned 
working capital at july  was  compared to  at july  we have no long term debt 
we currently have a  revolving line of credit which bears interest at negotiated rates below prime and expires on november  there were no borrowings on this line of credit during the year ended july  the loan agreement executed in connection with the line of credit contains certain covenants  including restrictions on additional indebtedness  and requires us to maintain certain financial ratios 
we believe that internally generated funds and the line of credit will be sufficient to meet our current needs and any additional capital requirements

critical accounting principles the consolidated financial statements of thor are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
table of contents periods presented 
we believe that of our accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity impairment of goodwill  trademarks and long lived assets we at least annually review the carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
long lived assets  identifiable intangibles that are amortized  goodwill and trademarks with indefinite useful lives are also reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable from future cash flows 
this review is performed using estimates of future cash flows 
if the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired  an impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
management believes that the estimates of future cash flows and fair values are reasonable  however changes in estimates of such cash flows and fair values could affect the evaluations 
insurance reserves generally  we are self insured for workers compensation and group medical insurance 
under these plans  liabilities are recognized for claims incurred  including those incurred but not reported  and changes in the reserves 
the liability for workers compensation claims is determined by the company with the assistance of a third party administrator using various state statutes and reserve requirements and historical claims experience 
group medical reserves are funded through a trust and are estimated using historical claims experience 
we have a self insured retention for products liability and personal injury matters of  per occurrence 
we have established a reserve on our balance sheet for such occurrences based on historical data and actuarial information 
we maintain excess liability insurance aggregating  with outside insurance carriers to minimize our risks related to catastrophic claims in excess of all our self insured positions 
any material change in the aforementioned factors could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
warranty we provide customers of our products with a warranty covering defects in material or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to two years  with longer warranties on certain structural components 
we record a liability based on our best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
factors we use in estimating the warranty liability include a history of units sold  existing dealer inventory  average cost incurred and a profile of the distribution of warranty expenditures over the warranty period 
a significant increase in dealer shop rates  the cost of parts or the frequency of claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such claims or additional costs materialize 
management believes that the warranty reserve is adequate  however actual claims incurred could differ from estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserves 
warranty reserves are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a quarterly basis 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under the provision of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for incomes taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequence of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from the sale of recreation vehicles and buses are recorded when all of the following conditions have been met an order for a product has been received from a dealer  written or oral approval for payment has been received from the dealer s flooring institution  a common carrier signs the delivery ticket accepting responsibility for the product as agent for the dealer  and the product is removed from the company s property for delivery to the dealer who placed the order 

table of contents certain shipments are sold to customers on credit or cash on delivery cod terms 
the company recognizes revenue on credit sales upon shipment and cod sales upon payment and delivery 
most sales are made by dealers financing their purchases under flooring arrangements with banks or finance companies 
products are not sold on consignment  dealers do not have the right to return products  and dealers are typically responsible for interest costs to floorplan lenders 
on average  the company receives payments from floor plan lenders on products sold to dealers within days of the invoice date 
repurchase commitments it is customary practice for companies in the recreation vehicle industry to enter into repurchase agreements with financing institutions to provide financing to their dealers 
generally  these agreements provide for the repurchase of products from the financing institution in the event of a dealer s default 
the risk of loss under these agreements is spread over numerous dealers and further reduced by the resale value of the units which the company would be required to repurchase 
losses under these agreements have not been significant in the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements  and management believes that any future losses under these agreements will not have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company records repurchase and guarantee reserves based on prior experience and known current events 
principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments at july  are summarized in the following charts 
we have no other off balance sheet commitments 
contractual payments due by period obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal after years operating leases total contractual cash obligations other total amount of commitment expiration per period commercial amounts less than commitments committed year years years over years guarantees standby repurchase obligations total commercial commitments accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin addresses the accounting and disclosure of uncertain tax positions 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we have adopted fin effective august  we estimate that the adoption of fin will result in a net decrease to beginning retained earnings of less than  primarily related to the accrual of the estimated tax liabilities related to the uncertain tax positions  plus estimated interest and penalties 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
gives us the irrevocable option to carry many financial assets and liabilities at fair values  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for thor s fiscal year beginning august   although early adoption is permitted 
we are currently assessing the potential impact that adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value accounting  sfas which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
sfas will be effective for thor s fiscal year beginning august  we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s cash flows and earnings are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency related to its operations in canada 
however  because of the size of the company s canadian operations  a hypothetical change in the canadian dollar as compared to the us dollar would not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company s cash flows and earnings are also exposed to market risks related to interest rates because of the significant amount of cash that is invested in investments  including corporate debt securities 
the vast majority of our investments are invested in institutional money market funds or securities whose interest rate is re set every days  minimizing the risk of interest rate fluctuations on their fair value 
the company has established an investment policy which governs its investment strategy and stipulates that it diversify investments among united states treasury securities and other high credit quality debt instruments that it believes to be low risk 
the company is averse to principal loss and seeks to preserve its invested funds by limiting default risk and market risk 
a hypothetical change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
the company has no debt and currently does not use interest rate swaps  futures contracts or options on futures  or other types of derivative financial instruments
