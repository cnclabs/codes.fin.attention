item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and result of operations 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities  anticipated cash flow from our existing collaboration with roche and net proceeds from our offering of common stock in february will be sufficient to support our current operating plan into the first half of  although we may choose to obtain additional financing from time to time 
we have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors  including the following our ability to establish any new partnering arrangements  our rights and obligations under any new partnering arrangements and our ability to generate revenues under any new partnering arrangements  the extent to which clinical and other development activities are funded or conducted by our current partners  roche  pfizer and the nci  our ability to sell shares of our common stock under our committed equity financing facility  or ceff  with kingsbridge capital limited  or kingsbridge  the progress  success and costs of preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates  any acceleration or expansion of our clinical development plans  our ability to maintain or extend our existing partnering arrangements with roche  pfizer and the nci  the progress  number and costs of our research programs  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending patent and other intellectual property rights  any need to obtain licenses to additional patents or other intellectual property in order to use  import  manufacture  market or sell our product candidates  any need to expand our manufacturing capabilities  and expenses associated with any possible future litigation 
our committed equity financing facility with kingsbridge may not be available to us if we elect to make a draw down  may require us to make additional blackout or other payments to kingsbridge and may result in dilution to our stockholders 
in july  we entered into a ceff with kingsbridge 
the ceff entitles us to sell and obligates kingsbridge to purchase  from time to time through september   shares of our common stock for cash consideration up to an aggregate of million  subject to certain conditions and restrictions 
kingsbridge will not be obligated to 
table of contents purchase shares under the ceff unless certain conditions are met  which include a minimum price for our common stock  the accuracy of representations and warranties made to kingsbridge  compliance with laws  and the effectiveness of a registration statement registering for resale the shares of common stock to be issued in connection with the ceff 
in addition  among other termination rights  kingsbridge is permitted to terminate the ceff by providing written notice to us within trading days after it obtains actual knowledge that an event has occurred resulting in a material and adverse effect on our business  operations  properties or financial condition 
if we are unable to access funds through the ceff  or if kingsbridge terminates the ceff  we may be unable to access capital on favorable terms  or at all 
we are entitled  in certain circumstances  to deliver a blackout notice to kingsbridge to suspend the use of the resale registration statement and prohibit kingsbridge from selling shares under the resale registration statement for a certain period of time 
if we deliver a blackout notice in certain circumstances  or if the resale registration statement is not effective in circumstances not permitted by the agreement  then we must make a payment to kingsbridge  or issue kingsbridge additional shares in lieu of this payment  calculated on the basis of the number of shares purchased by kingsbridge in the most recent draw down and held by kingsbridge immediately prior to the blackout period and the change in the market price of our common stock during the period in which the use of the registration statement is suspended 
if the trading price of our common stock declines during a suspension of the resale registration statement  the blackout or other payment could be significant 
in october  we received million in gross proceeds from the sale of  shares of common stock to kingsbridge pursuant to the ceff 
should we sell additional shares to kingsbridge under the ceff  or issue shares in lieu of a blackout payment  it will have a dilutive effect on the holdings of our current stockholders and may result in downward pressure on the price of our common stock 
if we draw down under the ceff  we will issue shares to kingsbridge at a discount of up to from the volume weighted average price of our common stock 
if we draw down amounts under the ceff when our share price is decreasing  we will need to issue more shares to raise the same amount than if our stock price was higher 
issuances in the face of a declining share price will have an even greater dilutive effect than if our share price were stable or increasing and may further decrease our share price 
if we are unable to recruit and retain skilled employees and consultants  we may not be able to successfully operate our business 
retaining our current management and other employees and recruiting qualified scientific personnel to perform future research  manufacturing and development work will be critical to our success 
none of our employees have employment commitments for any fixed period of time and could leave our employment at will 
in march  we implemented a corporate restructuring that resulted in a workforce reduction 
we may have difficulty attracting required personnel as a result of a perceived risk of future workforce and expense reductions  or otherwise 
competition is intense among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions for experienced scientists and other personnel  and we may not be able to retain or recruit sufficient skilled personnel on acceptable terms to allow us to pursue collaborations and develop our product candidates and research programs  which would likely have an adverse effect on our business 
if our current partnering arrangements are unsuccessful or if conflicts develop with our partners  our research and development efforts could be delayed  curtailed or terminated  our revenues could significantly decrease and our operations may be adversely affected 
we have a collaboration agreement with roche in the field of epothilones and a license agreement with pfizer for our motilin agonist program 
we also have collaborations with  or have licenses to technology and compounds from  several research groups  including sloan kettering in the field of epothilones  the nci in the field of geldanamycin 
table of contents kosan biosciences analogs and stanford university in the field of polyketide technology 
the agreements permit our collaborators or licensors to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances 
our collaboration agreements with the nci are currently set to expire in october we may not be able to maintain or extend our collaborations or license agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we do not maintain  extend or replace our collaboration with roche or our license to pfizer  the research and development efforts for our product candidates could be delayed  our revenues would significantly decrease and our operations could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to maintain our research collaborations  including our collaboration agreements with the nci  or if our in license agreements are terminated  our research and development efforts could be delayed  curtailed or terminated or we could lose our rights to use the licensed technology and compounds 
we control neither the amount nor timing of resources that our partners devote to our programs or potential products  nor the scope  content and timing of the efforts that they conduct or permit 
as a result  we do not know if our partners will dedicate sufficient resources or if the development or commercialization efforts by our corporate partners will be successful 
we also do not know if the development or commercialization efforts by our partners will be the same as those we would choose to devote if we solely controlled the development and commercialization of our programs and product candidates 
in particular  in our collaboration with roche  we do not control the amount and timing of resources that roche devotes to the epothilone program  and we do not control the scope  content and timing of the preclinical studies  clinical trials and other development efforts that roche conducts or permits under the program  including for kos in our collaboration with the nci  we do not control the selection  conduct  timing and resources provided to clinical trials of tanespimycin or alvespimycin sponsored by the nci 
for these reasons  we may choose to undertake product development efforts that are within the scope of our collaborations at our own expense 
under our license agreement with pfizer  pfizer controls all development  regulatory and commercial activities related to our motilin agonist program 
we also do not know whether our current partners or future partners  if any  might pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products either on their own or in collaboration with others  including our competitors  as a means for developing treatments for the diseases targeted by the partnering arrangements with us 
in addition  business combinations or significant changes in a partner s business strategy may adversely affect its willingness or ability to continue the partnering arrangement with us 
failure by our partners to develop or commercialize a compound or product for which they have rights from us could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for example  if roche does not successfully develop and commercialize a product from our epothilone program  we may not receive any future milestone payments and will not receive any royalties under our collaboration with roche 
if our partners fail to conduct research  development or commercialization activities successfully and in a timely manner or if they or our licensors breach or terminate their agreements with us  the development or commercialization of the affected product candidates  technology or research program could be delayed or terminated 
if any of our existing partnering arrangements are terminated  we may be required to seek new partners or to undertake product development and commercialization at our own expense 
this may limit the number of product candidates we will be able to develop and commercialize  significantly increase our capital requirements and reduce the likelihood of successful product introduction 
disputes might also arise with partners or licensors concerning rights to particular compounds or technologies 
if we are unable to resolve these disputes in our favor  we could lose our rights to use those compounds or technologies 

table of contents if we fail to enter into new partnering arrangements in the future  our business and operations would be negatively impacted 
our strategy depends upon the formation and sustainability of multiple collaborative arrangements and license agreements with third parties 
we expect to rely on these arrangements for not only financial resources  but also for expertise that we expect to need in the future relating to clinical trials  manufacturing  sales and marketing  and for license and technology rights 
although we have established collaborative arrangements and various license agreements  we do not know if we will be able to establish additional arrangements on favorable terms  or whether current or any future partnering arrangements will ultimately be successful 
there have been  and may continue to be  a significant number of business combinations among pharmaceutical companies that have resulted  and may continue to result  in a reduced number of potential future partners  which may limit our ability to find partners who will work with us in developing and commercializing our product candidates 
if we do not enter into new collaborative agreements  in particular  a collaborative arrangement for the further development of our hsp inhibitor program  we may be required to curtail  suspend  delay or terminate research and development programs  including planned clinical trials for our product candidates  and therefore our ability to generate revenues from these programs will be adversely affected 
our ability to start new research and development programs may also be materially harmed 
our potential products are in development  and substantial additional effort and expense will be necessary for further development 
our product candidates are in various stages of research and development 
we may not be able to develop products that prove to be safe and effective  meet applicable regulatory standards  are capable of being manufactured at reasonable costs or can be marketed successfully 
all of the potential products that we are currently developing will require significant development and investment  including extensive clinical testing  before we can submit any application for regulatory approval 
for example  we expect to incur significant expenses in connection with our time clinical trial program for tanespimycin in combination with velcade for multiple myeloma 
these expenses will be even higher to the extent we are required to pay for patients medical or other expenses  including  for example  the cost of velcade for these studies 
our products must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved by the fda and international regulatory authorities for commercial use 
we will need to conduct significant additional research and clinical trials before we can determine if our products are sufficiently safe and effective to file with the fda and other regulatory agencies for product approval 
clinical trials are expensive and time consuming  and therefore  significant amounts of money will need to be spent testing our products 
in addition  significant time and investment will be required to try to develop manufacturing processes for our products so that they are economical to manufacture on a commercial scale and satisfactory to the fda and other governmental authorities 
the progress and results of our animal and human testing are highly uncertain 
we must provide the fda and foreign regulatory authorities with clinical data that demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products before they can be approved for commercial sale 
as a result  commercialization of our product candidates depends upon successful completion of preclinical and clinical trials 
preclinical testing and clinical development are long  expensive and uncertain processes 
it may take us a number of years to complete our testing  and failure can occur at any stage of testing 
for example  in october  we discontinued a phase clinical study of our first generation epothilone  kos  in hormone refractory prostate cancer because the study did not meet the primary objective of tumor marker response in the first stage of a two stage clinical trial  and we previously discontinued clinical studies of kos in patients with non small cell lung cancer and colorectal cancer 
we could experience similar failures in other current or future clinical testing of our product candidates 

table of contents kosan biosciences success in preclinical testing and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful  and interim results of trials do not necessarily predict final results 
a number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry  including kosan  have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials  even after promising results in earlier trials 
also  preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways  which could delay  limit or prevent further testing or regulatory approval 
we do not know whether clinical trials of our product candidates will begin on time or whether any of our clinical trials will be completed on schedule  or at all 
we may plan and initiate clinical trials before final data from earlier studies have been collected and analyzed because it takes a significant amount of time and effort to plan and initiate clinical trials and because of the length of time it takes to successfully develop a product candidate 
consequently  we may need to modify  suspend  cancel or terminate clinical trials based on final results from earlier studies 
we also do not know whether clinical trials will indicate that an earlier stage compound or formulation will be more appropriate for clinical and commercial development than a compound or formulation that is at a later stage of clinical development  and therefore result in extended timelines as well as increased development costs 
for example  roche and we decided in february to cease development of kos in favor of further development of our second generation epothilone product candidate  kos negative or inconclusive results or adverse medical events during a clinical trial could cause a clinical trial to be suspended  terminated or repeated 
certain of the clinical trials of our product candidates are or may in the future be designed to include two stages  with the decision whether to proceed to the second stage dependent on results obtained in the first stage 
failure to achieve predetermined response rates as defined in the protocol may result in the decision not to proceed into the second stage of the trial 
we have multiple product candidates in human clinical trials for the treatment of cancer 
anticancer drugs frequently have a narrow therapeutic window between efficacy and toxicity 
if unacceptable toxicity is observed in a clinical trial  the trial may be terminated at an early stage 
for example  in june  we discontinued a phase clinical study of kos in colorectal cancer due to unanticipated cumulative drug toxicities in patients who had previously been treated with the cancer treatment oxaliplatin 
we also observed a higher incidence of adverse events resulting in patient withdrawal in our phase clinical study of kos in hormone refractory prostate cancer than in our phase non small cell lung cancer trial 
we cannot predict whether any clinical trials of our product candidates will demonstrate toxicity issues or adverse events resulting in a significant patient withdrawal 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more 
the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of the product candidate 
our clinical trials may be suspended at any time if we  our collaborators  the fda  or other regulatory authorities believe the patients participating in our studies are exposed to unacceptable health risks or that study protocols or patient informed consents should be amended to reflect additional health risks  additional testing procedures or other changes 
for example  in september  we temporarily suspended enrollment in our tanespimycin and alvespimycin clinical trials in connection with a request by the fda to amend the protocols and patient informed consents for those trials 
we provided amended protocols and informed consents for those clinical trials to the fda in response to certain of its requested changes  and we resumed enrollment in the clinical trials 
the fda may require further changes to these protocols and informed consents  which may have a material adverse effect on the timing of  and our ability to conduct  the tanespimycin and alvespimycin clinical trials 
our ability to commence or timely complete clinical trials may be adversely affected by many factors  including ineffectiveness of the study compound  or perceptions by physicians that the compound is not effective for a particular indication  inability to manufacture sufficient quantities of compound for use in clinical trials  
table of contents a failure to obtain approval from the fda  other regulatory authorities or an investigational site s institutional review board to conduct a clinical trial  inability to reach agreement with a sufficient number of investigational sites to conduct a study  the number of patients required  slower than expected rate of patient recruitment or inability to recruit a sufficient number of patients  the occurrence of adverse medical events  including death  during a clinical trial  even if caused by the advanced status of patients disease or medical problems that are not related to our product candidates  inconclusive or negative results from a clinical trial  competing clinical trials in the same or similar indication  third party clinical investigators failing to perform our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or consistent with a clinical trial protocol  and other third party organizations not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner  and a decision by the fda or other governmental authorities to require suspension or modification of a clinical trial 
our product development costs will increase if we have delays in testing or approvals  if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned or if our clinical trials include more expensive testing or other procedures than planned 
if the delays are significant  our financial results and the commercial prospects for our products will be harmed  and our ability to become profitable will be adversely affected 
if any clinical trials of our product candidates are not successful  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be harmed 
if we are not able to obtain required regulatory approvals  we will not be able to commercialize our product candidates  and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired 
our product candidates and the activities associated with their development  manufacture and commercialization are subject to comprehensive regulation by the fda and other regulatory agencies in the united states  and by comparable authorities in other countries 
our products may not be commercialized unless and until our partners or we obtain regulatory approval from the fda or foreign governmental authorities to do so 
the process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive  often takes many years  if approval is obtained at all  and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity  novelty  safety and efficacy of the product candidates involved 
we have not received regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates in any jurisdiction and  although our personnel have experience from working at other companies  we as a company have no experience in preparing and filing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals to commercialize our products 
this lack of experience may impede our ability to obtain fda or other foreign regulatory approvals to commercialize our products in a timely manner  if at all 
changes in the regulatory approval policy during the development period  changes in or the enactment of additional regulations or statutes  or changes in regulatory review for each submitted product application  may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application for regulatory approval 
furthermore  the approval procedure and the time required to obtain approval varies among countries and can involve additional testing beyond that required by the fda 
approval by one regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions 
the fda and other regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical  clinical 
table of contents kosan biosciences or other studies or modifications to the manufacturing processes or facilities or quality control procedures for our product candidates 
for example  we plan to commence during late stage clinical trials of tanespimycin  and  if the results are favorable  we believe these clinical trials will support the filing of an nda with the fda for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
however  the fda or other regulatory authorities may require additional data prior to accepting or approving an application for marketing approval for tanespimycin or other product candidates  which would result in delays in potential fda or other regulatory authority approval and additional costs  either of which may be too significant to continue development of tanespimycin or other product candidates 
this risk is further compounded by any changes during development of a product candidate  such as changes in manufacturing processes  formulations or dosing regimens 
any clinical trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the fda or other regulatory authorities 
for example  we currently conduct  and expect to conduct in the future  clinical trials for our product candidates in countries outside of the united states 
the fda or other regulatory authorities may reject data from clinical trials conducted in other countries if they are not conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory standards and procedures 
we do not know whether clinical trials for our product candidates will demonstrate safety and efficacy sufficient to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals or will result in marketable products 
our or our partners failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our products under development will prevent receipt of fda and foreign approvals and  ultimately  commercialization of our products 
we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials  and those third parties may not perform satisfactorily 
we do not have the ability to independently conduct clinical trials for our products  and we rely on third parties such as contract research organizations  laboratory testing companies  medical institutions and clinical investigators to perform this function 
we also rely on roche to conduct certain clinical trials for kos  pfizer to conduct all clinical trials for our motilin agonist program  including kos  and the nci to conduct certain clinical trials for tanespimycin and alvespimycin 
we may rely on future partners to conduct clinical trials for our product candidates 
if any of these third parties do not successfully carry out their obligations or meet expected deadlines  clinical trials may be extended  delayed  suspended or terminated  data generated from clinical trials may not be acceptable to the fda or other regulatory authorities and our product candidates may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized 
we may not be able to obtain or maintain orphan drug exclusivity for our product candidates 
some jurisdictions  including europe and the united states  may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs 
the fda and the european medicines agency have granted orphan drug status to tanespimycin for the treatment of multiple myeloma and chronic myelogenous leukemia 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in  or shorten the duration of  the regulatory review and approval process  but does make the product eligible for orphan drug exclusivity and  in the united states  specific tax credits 
generally  if a company receives the first marketing approval for a product with an orphan drug designation in the clinical indication for which it has such designation  the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity 
orphan drug exclusivity means that another application to market the same drug for the same indication may not be approved  except in limited circumstances  for a period of up to ten years in europe reviewable after six years  and for a period of seven years in the united states 
this exclusivity  however  could block the approval of tanespimycin for the treatment of multiple myeloma or chronic myelogenous leukemia in the united states or europe if a competitor obtains approval before us of a product containing tanespimycin for these specific indications 
even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for any of our product candidates  we may not be able to maintain it 
for example  if a competitive product is shown to be clinically superior to our product  any orphan drug exclusivity we have obtained will not block the approval of such competitive product 

table of contents even if any of our product candidates receives regulatory approval  we may still face significant development and regulatory difficulties 
even if the fda or other regulatory authorities approves a product candidate  the approval may impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses  conditions for use  labeling  advertising  promotion  marketing and or production of such product  and may impose ongoing requirements for post approval studies  including additional research and development and clinical trials 
in addition  regulatory agencies subject a product  its manufacturer and the manufacturer s facilities to continual review and periodic inspections 
if a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product  including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency  or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured  a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product  our partners or us  including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market 
if our partners  any of our product candidates that become approved for marketing by a regulatory authority or we fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements  a regulatory authority may take various actions  including issuing warning letters  imposing civil or criminal penalties  suspending regulatory approval  refusing to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us or our partners  imposing restrictions on operations  including costly new manufacturing requirements  or seizing or detaining products or requiring a product recall 
any inability to protect our proprietary technologies could significantly harm our business and ability to successfully commercialize product candidates 
our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies and product candidates in the united states and other countries and prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have 
intellectual property laws vary from country to country  and the laws of a particular country may afford less intellectual property protection than another country 
any patents that we or our partners own or license from third parties may not provide protection against competitors 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies and products are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
however  our patent positions  as well as the patent positions of biotechnology companies and other third parties  involve complex legal and factual questions  and  therefore  we cannot predict with certainty whether our patent applications will be allowed or any resulting patents will be valid and enforceable 
further  our patents or patent applications or those of our licensors could be placed into interference  and we may lose our rights in such patents or applications 
patents may be challenged  even by our partners  held unenforceable  invalidated or circumvented 
certain of our current exclusive license agreements restrict  and any future exclusive license agreements may restrict  our rights under patents and patent applications to certain fields of use  and therefore  we may not have the ability to prevent competitors from developing and commercializing our product candidates or technologies in fields of use not covered by our exclusive license agreements 

table of contents kosan biosciences the degree of future protection for our proprietary rights is uncertain  and we cannot ensure that we or our licensors were the first to make the inventions covered by each of our patents or pending patent applications  we or our licensors were the first to file patent applications for these inventions  others will not independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies  any of our or our licensors or partners pending patent applications will result in issued patents  any of our or our licensors or partners patents will be valid or enforceable  any patents issued to us or our licensors or collaborators will provide a basis for commercially viable products  will provide us with any competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  we will develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable  or the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our business 
we apply for patents covering our technologies  product candidates  formulations and uses thereof  as we deem appropriate 
however  we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or products in a timely fashion or at all 
our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products and technologies 
for example  tanespimycin  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the most advanced product candidate in our hsp inhibitor program  was originally disclosed in a now expired third party patent 
consequently  others can develop products containing tanespimycin 
we are aware of at least three other companies that have been developing product candidates containing or based on tanespimycin  and these companies have filed patent applications relating to their products in development 
other competitors may currently be developing  or may in the future develop  products containing or based on tanespimycin 
in addition  we generally are unable to control the patent prosecution of technology that we license from others to the same degree as we would for our own technology 
further  some of our patents and patent applications for our motilide program have been assigned to pfizer  and additional patents and patent applications may in the future be assigned to pfizer or other current or future partners 
we generally are unable to control the filing  prosecution and maintenance of patent rights that we assign to partners to the same degree as we would if we maintained ownership of them 
in addition to patents  we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how 
we have taken measures to protect our confidential information and trade secrets 
however  these measures may not provide adequate protection 
we seek to protect our confidential information and trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators  consultants and others 
nevertheless  parties may breach these agreements or competitors may otherwise obtain or independently develop our trade secrets 
interference  opposition or similar proceedings relating to our patents and patent applications are costly  and an unfavorable outcome could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates 
we are aware of a significant number of patents and patent applications relating to aspects of our technologies and compounds filed by  and issued to  other parties 
others have filed patent applications or have been granted patents claiming inventions also claimed or licensed by us  and we may have to participate in an interference or other proceeding before a patent agency or court to determine priority of invention or which party was first to invent and  thus  has the right to a patent for these inventions 
we believe one or more interferences may be declared between 
table of contents patents and applications we own or have exclusively licensed and patents and applications owned by abbott laboratories or biotica technologies ltd 
relating to erythromycin polyketide synthase  or pks  genes  methods for altering pks genes  and erythromycin analogs 
in april  a hearing was held at the european patent office to address an opposition filed by biotica to one of our exclusively licensed patents related to the recombinant production of polyketides 
the european patent office maintained  or upheld  the patent  but with narrowing amendments 
both parties have filed an appeal 
we believe an interference may also be declared between patents and applications we have exclusively licensed from two parties covering kos a proceeding or a lawsuit involving an interference or opposition could result in substantial cost to us even if the outcome is favorable  and if the outcome is unfavorable  we could be required to license the other party s rights  on terms that may be unfavorable to us  or cease using the technology 
an interference or opposition may also result in loss of claims based on patentability grounds raised in the interference or opposition 
although patent and intellectual property disputes in the biotechnology area are often settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and could include ongoing royalties 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that a license would be available to us on satisfactory terms  if at all 
companies and others developing products that could compete with our product candidates  such as novartis ag in the area of potential epothilone products  may be particularly unwilling to grant us a license at any price 
if we are not able to obtain necessary licenses  we may not be able to manufacture or commercialize our product candidates  which would materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
claims by third parties of intellectual property infringement would require us to spend time and money and could deprive us of valuable rights needed to develop or commercialize our products 
our commercial success depends significantly on not infringing the patents and proprietary rights of other parties and not breaching any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies and products 
other parties may currently or in the future possess intellectual property rights covering product candidates that we or our partners are developing or desire to develop  methods of treatment or administration involving our product candidates  formulations of our product candidates  and genes  gene fragments  cell lines  compounds and other technologies we use or may wish to use 
any infringement of patent rights or violation of other proprietary rights may require us to obtain a license from another party  forego product development or commercialization or face lawsuits or other claims 
the biotechnology industry is characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights 
we are aware of patents and published patent applications that  if valid  and if we are unsuccessful in circumventing or acquiring the rights to these patents  may block our ability to commercialize products based on the product candidates that we are developing or pursue our pks gene manipulation and production technologies 
we cannot be sure that other parties have not filed for or obtained relevant patents that could affect our ability to obtain patents or operate our business 
others  including our partners  may challenge our patent or other intellectual property rights or sue us for patent infringement  misappropriation of their intellectual property rights or breach of license agreements 
we may be required to commence legal proceedings to resolve our patent or other intellectual property rights 
an adverse determination in any litigation or administrative proceeding to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities  result in our patents being deemed invalid  unenforceable or revoked  require us to license disputed rights from others or to cease using the disputed technology 
in addition  our involvement in any of these proceedings may cause us to incur substantial costs and result in diversion of management and technical personnel 

table of contents kosan biosciences other parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that our products or the use of our technologies infringes these patents or that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any claims that the use of our technologies infringes any patents  defending ourselves against any claim that we are employing any proprietary technology without authorization or enforcing our patents against others 
furthermore  parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to develop  commercialize and sell products  and could result in the award of substantial damages against us 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us  we may be required to pay substantial damages  stop producing certain products and using certain methods  develop non infringing products and methods  and obtain one or more licenses from other parties 
we may not be able to obtain licenses from other parties at a reasonable cost  or at all 
if we are not able to obtain necessary licenses at a reasonable cost or at all  we could encounter substantial delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods and products  which we may not be able to accomplish 
litigation or the failure to obtain licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or commercializing products and could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operation 
manufacturing difficulties could delay or preclude commercialization of our products and substantially increase our expenses 
we currently use contract manufacturers to make tanespimycin and alvespimycin active pharmaceutical ingredients and to formulate the final drug products 
the nci formulates the final drug product for alvespimycin and the formulation of tanespimycin being studied by it under our cooperative research and development agreements  or cradas 
we maintain a limited inventory of tanespimycin and alvespimycin drug product at our facilities in hayward  california  and we also maintain a limited inventory at the facilities of an outside contractor 
the nci is not obligated to maintain an inventory of either the active pharmaceutical ingredient or formulated drug product for alvespimycin or the formulation of tanespimycin being studied by the nci under our crada 
in our epothilone program  we rely on contract manufacturers for the active pharmaceutical ingredient for kos drug product for kos is formulated at our facilities and by an outside contractor 
we maintain limited inventories of formulated drug product for kos at our facilities in hayward  california and at the facilities of an outside contractor 
if any of our or our contract manufacturers manufacturing or inventory facilities encounter delays  are destroyed or otherwise become unavailable to us  then the clinical development of our product candidates or submissions for their regulatory approval  and therefore commercialization  could be delayed or precluded 
adverse effects would be particularly acute if problems arise with our sole sourcing or inventory relationships 
alternative qualified production capacity may not be available on a timely basis or at all because manufacturing processes for our product candidates are complex and may be subject to a lengthy regulatory approval process 
a number of factors could cause prolonged interruptions in the manufacturing and supply of our product candidates  including the failure of a supplier to provide raw materials or intermediates used for manufacture of our product candidates  equipment malfunctions or failures  
table of contents the failure to manufacture in accordance with current good manufacturing practices  fda or other regulatory requirements  the delay of product shipments due to us custom regulations or third party carriers used to transport our product candidates  and damage to our product candidates while they are in transit  changes in fda or other regulatory authority requirements or standards that require modifications to the manufacturing processes or facilities used in the production of our product candidates  action by the fda or other regulatory authorities to suspend production of one or more of our product candidates  or difficulties in scaling up production of our product candidates for large clinical trials or commercial supply 
while our manufacturing personnel have extensive experience from working at other companies  we as a company have no experience manufacturing products for commercial sale 
we may encounter difficulties in scaling up our manufacturing processes and equipment 
we may not be able to achieve such scale up in a timely manner or at a commercially reasonable cost  if at all 
in addition  our facilities in hayward  california are located within the san francisco bay area  an area where earthquakes periodically occur 
they are also located in a designated flood zone 
our access to any raw materials  intermediates  active pharmaceutical ingredients or formulated drug product for our product candidates sourced or inventoried through our facilities in hayward  california may be subject to interruption  damage or loss in the event of an earthquake or flood 
as discussed above  we rely upon outside contractors to manufacture and supply to us raw materials  intermediates  active pharmaceutical ingredients and formulated drug product for our product candidates 
our dependence upon others for the manufacture of our product candidates and their components may adversely affect our ability to continue clinical development of our product candidates in a timely manner and may adversely affect any future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any products that we may develop on a timely and competitive basis 
dependence on contract manufacturers involves a number of additional risks  many of which are outside of our control  including failure of a contract manufacturer to manufacture products to our specifications or to deliver products in the quantities  timeframe or manner that we require  a decision by the fda or other regulatory authorities not to approve our use of a particular contract manufacturer to supply our products  intellectual property rights to any improvements in a manufacturing process or new manufacturing processes being owned by or shared with a contract manufacturer  termination of an agreement with a contract manufacturer or increased prices charged by a contract manufacturer  or a contract manufacturer declaring bankruptcy or otherwise going out of business 
any of these factors could cause us to delay or suspend clinical trials  regulatory submissions or commercialization of our products and could result in significantly increased costs 
in addition  our future contract manufacturers may not be in the united states  and we currently utilize contract manufacturers located outside the united states 
consequently  we may face additional manufacturing difficulties due to a number of potential factors  including importation and customs issues  political uncertainties and a potentially limited ability to enforce our contractual rights against parties not located within the united states 

table of contents kosan biosciences we face intense competition from pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies and academic groups 
we face  and will continue to face  intense competition from organizations such as biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies  that are pursuing competing technologies and products 
these organizations may develop or currently possess technologies or products that are superior alternatives to ours 
for example  companies with competing hsp inhibitors include biogen idec inc  which has initiated phase clinical trials in solid tumors with its intravenous formulation of tanespimycin and its oral synthetic hsp inhibitor and has announced that it expects to initiate phase clinical trials in  infinity pharmaceuticals  which has initiated a phase clinical trial of its intravenous hsp inhibitor in non small cell lung cancer and a phase clinical trial in gastrointestinal stromal tumors and has an oral formulation in preclinical development in collaboration with medimmune  inc  abraxis bioscience  inc  which has a nanoparticle formulation of tanespimycin in preclinical development  vernalis plc  which has announced that it has selected an intravenous and an oral hsp inhibitor preclinical development candidate in collaboration with novartis ag and expects to initiate phase clinical trials in mid  serenex  inc  which has announced plans to file an ind for its oral hsp inhibitor in the first quarter of  and synta pharmaceuticals corp  which announced plans to file an ind for its hsp inhibitor in the first half of  as well as other companies reported to be pursuing hsp inhibitors 
competing epothilones in clinical development include those being developed by bms  which is reported to be in phase clinical trials  novartis ag  which is reported to be in phase clinical trials  and schering ag  which is reported to be in phase clinical trials 
gastrointestinal motility competitors include chugai pharmaceuticals  whose motilide agonist is reported to be in phase clinical trials 
thus  it is possible that  even if we are successful in developing any of our product candidates  one or more compounds of our competitors will be approved and marketed before our own 
this could place our partners and us at a significant disadvantage and could prevent us from realizing significant commercial benefit from such compounds 
further  our competitors in the polyketide gene engineering field may be more effective at implementing their technologies to develop commercial products or may hold or develop patents or other proprietary rights that may prevent us from practicing our technologies and pursuing our programs 
we also face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for partnering arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions and for licenses to additional technologies 
these competitors  either alone or with their collaborative partners  may succeed in developing technologies or products that are superior to ours 
any products that we develop through our technologies will compete in multiple  highly competitive markets 
development of pharmaceutical products requires significant investment and resources 
many of the organizations competing with us in the markets for such products have greater capital resources  research and development and marketing staffs  facilities and capabilities  and greater experience in discovery and developing drugs  obtaining regulatory approvals and product manufacturing and marketing 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in more rapidly developing and marketing technologies and products that are more effective than our technologies and products or that would render our products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on  among other things our ability to develop novel product candidates with attractive pharmaceutical properties and to secure and protect intellectual property rights based on our innovations  the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  the speed at which we and our partners develop our product candidates  our and our partners ability to design and successfully execute appropriate clinical trials  
table of contents our and our partners ability to obtain regulatory approvals to market our product candidates and the timing and scope of any regulatory approvals  our and our partners ability to manufacture commercial quantities and sell any product candidates that are approved for marketing  acceptance of future products by physicians and other healthcare providers  and the development of effective pricing and reimbursement strategies 
if we face product liability claims  these claims will divert our management s time and we will incur litigation costs  and if we are held liable  our business  financial condition and results of operation may be materially harmed 
we face an inherent business risk of liability claims in the event that the use of our potential products in clinical trials or otherwise  or any other products manufactured in our facility  results in personal injury or death 
even though we have obtained product liability insurance  it may not be sufficient to cover claims that may be made against us 
product liability insurance is expensive  difficult to obtain and may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
any claims against us  regardless of their merit  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operation  because litigation related to these claims would strain our financial resources in addition to consuming the time and attention of our management 
if we are sued for any injuries caused by our products or products manufactured at our facility  our liability could exceed our total assets 
we use hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials in our business 
any claims relating to improper handling  storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly 
our research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials  including hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials 
some of these materials may be novel  including bacteria with novel properties and bacteria that produce biologically active compounds 
our operations also produce hazardous waste products 
we cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge and any resultant injury from these materials 
federal  state and local laws and regulations govern the use  manufacture  storage  handling  shipment and disposal of these materials 
we could be subject to civil damages in the event of an improper or unauthorized release of  or exposure of individuals to  hazardous materials 
in addition  we could be sued for injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by third parties or our partners of these materials  and our liability may exceed our insurance coverage and total assets 
compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive  and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research  development or commercialization efforts 
in the event we do not comply with any of these laws or regulations  we may incur significant fines  our governmental licenses or permits may be revoked or we may face additional penalties  any of which could harm our business 
we have a stockholders rights plan and anti takeover provisions in our corporate charter documents that may result in outcomes with which you do not agree 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions of those shares without further vote or action by our stockholders 
the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future may adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could make it more difficult for third parties to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
our certificate of incorporation provides for staggered terms for the members of the board of directors and prevents our stockholders from acting by written consent 
these provisions and other provisions of our bylaws and of 
table of contents kosan biosciences delaware law applicable to us could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest involving us 
this could reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without these provisions 
in addition  these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors 
this is because our board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team 
we have adopted a rights agreement under which all stockholders have the right to purchase shares of a new series of preferred stock at an exercise price of per one one hundredth of a share  if a person acquires more than of our common stock 
the rights plan could make it more difficult for a person to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock 
the rights plan could also reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock and result in the market price being lower than it would be without the rights plan 
in addition  the existence of the rights plan itself may deter a potential acquirer from acquiring us 
as a result  either by operation of the rights plan or by its potential deterrent effect  mergers and acquisitions of us that our stockholders may consider in their best interests may not occur 
our stock price has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
the trading price of our common stock has been  and is likely to continue to be  highly volatile 
during the period from january  through december   our common stock traded between and on the nasdaq global market 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors  many of which are beyond our control  including delay or failure in initiating  conducting  completing or analyzing clinical trials or unsatisfactory design of or data from these trials by our collaborators or us  announcements of data from clinical trials  new partnering arrangements or other developments that do not meet the expectations of analysts  investors or other third parties  developments in clinical trials for potentially competitive product candidates  changes in the united states or foreign health care systems or regulations  regulatory approvals for competitive product candidates or delays or failures by our partners or us in obtaining regulatory approvals for our product candidates  new products or services introduced or announced by us or our competitors  announcements of technological developments in research by us or our competitors  published reports by securities analysts  announcements of expirations  terminations or amendments of collaborations  licenses or government research grants  or announcements that we have entered into new collaboration  licensing or similar arrangements  departures of key personnel  developments or disputes as to patent or other proprietary rights  litigation or an unfavorable outcome in litigation  sales of our common stock  announcements of  and actual or anticipated fluctuations in  our financial results  and economic and other external factors  disasters or crises 

table of contents in addition  the stock market in general  and the nasdaq global market and the market for biotechnology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies 
these broad market and industry factors may seriously harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
if this type of litigation were instituted against us  we would be faced with substantial costs and management s attention and resources would be diverted  which could in turn seriously harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we expect that our quarterly and annual results of operations will fluctuate  and this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline  creating investor losses 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or decline 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include expiration or termination of partnering arrangements  which may not be renewed or replaced  the success rate of our or our partners efforts leading to milestone payments and royalties under our partnering arrangements with roche or pfizer or any future collaboration or license agreements  the progress of our product candidates in clinical trials  and therefore  the timing of expenses for those clinical trials  the timing and willingness of partners to develop and commercialize our products  general and industry specific economic conditions  which may affect our partners research and development expenditures  and costs and expenses related to any litigation or administrative proceedings in which we may be involved 
if our revenues decline or do not grow due to expiration  termination or amendment of current or future collaboration agreements or licenses  failure to obtain new contracts or other factors  we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses correspondingly 
in addition  we expect operating expenses to continue to increase 
failure to achieve anticipated levels of revenues could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter or year to year comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
our operating results in some quarters or years may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in that case  our stock price may decline 
changes in the accounting treatment of stock options will continue to adversely affect our results of operations 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  or sfas r  on january   under which we are required to record additional compensation expense related to stock options and other share based payments in and beyond 
this statement had no impact on our financial position  however  it negatively impacted and will continue to have a negative impact on our earnings and reported results of operations compared to the results we have reported under prior accounting standards on stock options and other share based payments 

table of contents kosan biosciences if we are unable to favorably assess the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting  or if our independent auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment  our stock price could be adversely affected 
pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  on an annual basis  our management is required to report on  and our independent auditors to attest to  the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting 
the rules governing the standards that must be met for management to make its annual assessment are complex and require significant documentation and testing 
while our internal controls over financial reporting were deemed effective by both our management and our independent auditors as of december   there may be changes in our systems  processes or operations that will affect the effectiveness of internal controls in the future 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements 
our future assessments of internal controls may continue to result in increased expenses and the devotion of significant management resources 
if we cannot favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting in the future  or if our independent auditors are unable to provide an unqualified attestation report on our assessment  investor confidence and our stock price could be adversely affected

overview we are a cancer therapeutics company focused on advancing two new classes of anticancer agents through clinical development hsp inhibitors and epothilones 
the following is the status of our product candidates 
hsp inhibitors tanespimycin our proprietary formulations of tanespimycin are in phase and clinical trials  primarily for multiple myeloma in combination with velcade  for her positive metastatic breast cancer in combination with herceptin and as monotherapy for melanoma 
in mid  we expect to present data from a phase b clinical trial of tanespimycin in multiple myeloma in combination with velcade and a phase clinical trial of tanespimycin in metastatic melanoma 
we intend to initiate our tanespimycin in myeloma evaluation  or time  clinical program for tanespimycin in the first half of the time program includes time  a phase pivotal study of tanespimycin in combination with velcade in first relapse patients with multiple myeloma  and time  a phase study of tanespimycin in combination with velcade in patients with relapsed refractory multiple myeloma 
alvespimycin intravenous and oral formulations of a second generation hsp inhibitor  alvespimycin hcl  are currently in phase clinical trials 
in mid  we expect to present data from a phase b clinical trial of intravenous alvespimycin in combination with herceptin in patients with solid tumors as well as interim results from a phase clinical trial of oral alvespimycin in solid tumors 
we intend to initiate a phase clinical trial of alvespimycin as monotherapy in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the first half of and a phase clinical trial investigating the combination of alvespimycin and herceptin in patients with her positive metastatic breast cancer in the second half of epothilones kos is our epothilone anticancer clinical candidate that is being evaluated in two dose escalating phase clinical trials in patients with solid tumors 
we expect to present data from our kos phase clinical trials in mid we expect to initiate phase clinical trials with kos in the second half of our epothilone program is partnered with roche through a global development and commercialization agreement  which requires roche to fund all of the current and anticipated kos clinical trials 
other programs we also have a motilin receptor agonist program for the stimulation of gastrointestinal movement  or gi motility 
in december  we established a worldwide exclusive license agreement with pfizer for our motilin agonist program  including kos and related compounds 
pfizer is responsible for all development  regulatory and commercial activities related to the motilin agonist program 
we expect pfizer to initiate phase clinical testing of kos later in 
table of contents we also have next generation hsp inhibitor  next generation epothilone and nuclear export inhibitor programs for cancer that are undergoing preclinical evaluation 
these programs are also based on the use of our technology to improve the structure of known polyketides and the efficiency of large scale production 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we expect to incur additional operating losses over the next several years as we continue to advance our product candidates into and through clinical trials 
we believe that our existing cash and investment securities  anticipated cash flow from our existing collaboration with roche and net proceeds from our offering of common stock in february will be sufficient to support our current operating plan into the first half of we expect that additional financing will be required in order to fund our operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the financial statements in the period they are determined 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates  which have been reviewed by our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the services  supplies or technology license has occurred  iii the price is fixed and determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize license and other up front fees pursuant to research and development collaboration agreements over our estimated period of continuing involvement with the research and development of the respective agreement 
these estimates are reviewed on a periodic basis and updated if the underlying assumptions are modified 
any changes in these estimates will result in either an acceleration or further deferral of the related revenue recognition 
payments related to substantive performance milestones that are at risk at the initiation of an agreement are recognized upon successful completion of a performance milestone event 
contract revenues related to collaborative research and development efforts are recognized as revenue as the related services are performed or delivered in accordance with contract terms 
such payments generally are made based on the number of full time equivalent researchers assigned to the collaboration project and the related research and development expenses incurred or as other deliverables under the contracts are fulfilled 
revenues related to government grants are recognized at the time a grant is awarded and as related research expenses are incurred 
any amounts received in advance of performance are recorded as deferred revenue until earned 
clinical trial accruals research and development expenditures are expensed as incurred 
our expenses related to clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with multiple institutions and clinical research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements 
table of contents kosan biosciences are established prior to the initiation of the related services  thus establishing the basis of our estimates 
however  these terms may be subject to amendment due to changes in the scope and length of the related clinical trial or work performed 
expenses related to clinical trials generally are accrued based on the level of patient enrollment and activity according to the protocol 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activity and adjust our estimates accordingly 
all estimates may differ significantly from the actual amounts subsequently invoiced 
no adjustments for material changes in estimates have been recognized in any period presented 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value expense recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method and therefore we did not restate prior periods results 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense beginning january  included compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas stock based compensation expense for all stock based payment awards granted after december  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
we recognize these compensation costs  net of an expected forfeiture rate  on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service period of the award  which is generally the option vesting term of one or four years 
we use the black scholes model to value stock based compensation expense 
separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
expected term is based on the simplified method allowed under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
and may only be applied through december  the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining term at the time of the option grant 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price and other factors 
the assumptions used to value stock based compensation to employees are subject to periodic adjustment 
as such  changes to these assumptions in the future could be substantial 
stock based compensation expense for options granted to non employees has been determined in accordance with sfas and emerging issues task force as the fair value of the consideration received or the fair value of the equity instruments issued  whichever is more reliably measured 
the measurement of stock based compensation to non employees is subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying securities vest 
as such  changes to these future period measurements could be substantial should we experience significant changes in our stock price 
for example  a increase in the price of our stock  from that of december   would translate into an approximately increase in our expense for options granted as of december  impairment of investments we recognize an impairment charge when the decline in the estimated fair value of a marketable security below the amortized cost is determined to be other than temporary 
we consider various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge  including the duration of time and the severity to which the fair value has been less than its amortized cost  any adverse changes in the investees financial condition and associated downgrades to credit ratings and our intent and ability to hold the marketable security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
for the years ended december   and  we did not recognize an impairment charge related to our investment securities 
income taxes since inception  we have recognized income taxes under the liability method 
deferred income taxes are recognized for differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities at enacted statutory rates in effect for years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is 
table of contents recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
in addition  valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
due to our lack of earnings history  our total deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance 
results of operations revenues in thousands except percentages year ended december  annual percent change contract revenue grant revenue total revenues revenues for the years ended december   and were approximately million  million and million  respectively  of which million was related to a non recurring milestone earned in revenues in consisted primarily of contract revenue recognized under our agreements with roche and pfizer 
revenues in and consisted primarily of contract revenue recognized under our agreement with roche and funded research related to government grant awards 
the increase in revenues of approximately  or million  in compared to was the result of the following approximately million in contract revenue from pfizer  reflecting the amortization of the million up front payment received in december  approximately million in lower contract revenue from roche  reflecting a decrease in kos development activities due the conclusion of certain clinical trials  partially offset by the million non recurring milestone in connection with our march letter agreement with roche  and approximately million in decreased grant revenue due to fewer grant awards in the decrease in revenues of approximately  or million  in compared to was the result of the following approximately million in lower funding  reflecting a decrease in kos research and preclinical expenses due to the completion of ind enabling studies in  lower reimbursement for kos production related activities due to the previous manufacture of sufficient clinical supply for anticipated clinical trials through and lower clinical trial reimbursement associated with the conclusion of certain kos phase clinical trials and the kos phase clinical trial in non small cell lung cancer  approximately million in decreased amortization of the million up front fee from roche due to the increase in the estimated clinical development period in december  and approximately million in decreased grant revenue due to the timing of effort spent on government grants and a lower number of grant awards in in february  roche and we jointly made a decision to advance kos into later stage clinical trials 
we expect that our contract revenues from roche will increase over the next several quarters as phase clinical trials 
table of contents kosan biosciences are initiated with kos this increase is expected to be partially offset by a decrease in the amortization of the million up front fee from roche due to the increase in the estimated clinical development period 
if we do not maintain our agreement with roche  our revenues will significantly decrease unless we enter into additional collaborations that provide substantial new revenues 
we expect that the unamortized portion of the up front fee from pfizer will be recognized in the first quarter of we do not expect our grant revenue to continue in due to changes in small business administration rules that make most public companies ineligible for small business grants 
research and development expenses for the years ended december   and  our research and development expenses were approximately million  million  and million  respectively 
our research and development activities consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  clinical trial related services performed by clinical research organizations and research institutions and other outside service providers  licensing related expenses  lab consumables and facility related expenses 
we group these activities into two major categories research and preclinical and clinical development 
we are unable to estimate the nature  timing or costs to complete our major research and development projects  or when material net cash inflows to us could be expected to commence  if ever  due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing pharmaceutical products 
these risks and uncertainties are fully discussed in this annual report under part i  item a

the costs associated with research and preclinical and clinical development activities approximated the following in thousands  except for percentages year ended december  annual percent change inception december  clinical development epothilones hsp inhibitors total clinical development research and preclinical total research and development research and preclinical constitutes research and development costs for our early stage programs in the areas of cancer  gastrointestinal motility and technology development in  and and infectious disease in and expenses for the years ended december   and include allocated personnel related expenses of approximately million  million and million  allocated facility related expenses of approximately million  million and million and allocated lab consumables of million  million and million  respectively 
expenses for the period from inception through december  include allocated personnel related expenses of approximately million  allocated facility related expense of approximately million and allocated lab consumables of million 

table of contents the decrease of  or approximately million  in research and development expenses for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to the following  including the recognition of stock based compensation expense due to the implementation of sfas r approximately million decrease in preclinical and research costs primarily related to reduced investment in certain non oncology  early stage research programs  offset by an increase of approximately million in clinical development primarily due to the advancement of our clinical product candidates in the hsp inhibitor program 
the decrease of  or approximately million  in research and development expenses for the year ended december  compared to was primarily due to the following approximately million in decreased research and preclinical costs  primarily due to advancing kos through ind enabling studies in the first half of  and approximately million in decreased clinical development costs in our epothilone program due to non recurring milestone payments made to a licensor in the third quarter of  partially offset by approximately million in increased clinical development costs in the hsp inhibitor program  including initiation of our tanespimycin phase and alvespimycin phase clinical trials  filing an ind for the oral formulation of alvespimycin and further advancement of tanespimycin through phase and phase b clinical trials

the ceff allows us to raise capital as required  at the time and in the amounts deemed suitable to us  through september  we are not obligated to sell any of the million of common stock available under the ceff  and there are no minimum commitments or minimum use penalties 
under the terms of the ceff  the maximum number of shares that we may sell to kingsbridge is  shares exclusive of the shares underlying a warrant  which may limit the amount of proceeds that we are able to obtain from the ceff 
in connection with the ceff  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant is currently exercisable and expires in in october  we received million in gross proceeds for the sale of  shares of our common stock to kingsbridge

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital for the purpose of funding our operations while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the principal amount of the investments to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and investments in a variety of securities  which may include commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and investment grade corporate obligations 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of our portfolio and cause unrealized gains and losses  such gains and losses would not be realized unless the investments were sold prior to maturity 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  at december  and rates  the fair value of our portfolio on those dates would decline by approximately million
