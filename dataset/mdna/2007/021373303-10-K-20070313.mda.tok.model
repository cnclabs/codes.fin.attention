item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
overview we are a canadian corporation  with principal assets and operations in the united states  whose primary business is developing and commercializing nanomaterial and titanium dioxide pigment technologies 
we are organized into four divisions  an advanced materials and power systems division  or amps  a life sciences division  an altair hydrochloride pigment process division  or ahp  and a performance materials division 
our research  development  production and marketing efforts are currently directed toward four primary market applications that utilize our proprietary technologies amps o the development  production and sale for testing purposes of electrode materials for use in a new class of high performance lithium ion batteries called lithium nanotitanate batteries 
o the design  development  and production of power our nanosafe brand nanotitanate battery cells  batteries  and battery packs as well as related design and test services 
life sciences o the co development of renazorb  a test stage active pharmaceutical ingredient  which is designed to be useful in the treatment of elevated serum phosphate levels in patients undergoing kidney dialysis 
o the co development of renalan  a test stage active pharmaceutical ingredient  which is designed to be useful in the treatment of elevated serum phosphate levels in animals suffering from chronic renal disease 
ahp the marketing and licensing of titanium dioxide pigment production technology 
advanced materials the testing  development  marketing and or licensing of nano structured ceramic powders for use in various application  such for advanced performance coatings  air and water purification systems  and nano sensor applications 
we also provide contract research services on select projects where we can utilize our resources to develop intellectual property and or new products and technology 
in the near term  as we continue to develop and market our products and technology  contract services will continue to be a substantial component of our operating revenues 
during the years ended december   and  contract services revenues comprised   and  respectively  of our operating revenues 
in the summary of our business below  we describe our various research products in connection with our description of the business segment to which each relates 
our revenues have been  and we expect them to continue to be  generated by license fees  product sales  commercial collaborations and contracts and grants 
we currently have agreements in place to provide research involving a technology used in the detection of chemical  biological and radiological agents  agreements under which we provide laboratory space  and provide services  in connection with testing and development related to the use of our ahp to produce titanium dioxide 

pigment and pigment related products from titanium bearing oil sands  supply nano sized anode and cathode materials for design and development of high capacity lithium ion battery and super capacitor applications  provide research utilizing nanotechnology processes for the production and commercialization of solar based hydrogen technologies  produce battery packs  and provide research to further develop battery electrode materials  nanosensors  and nanomaterials characterization 
in addition  we have entered into a licensing agreement for renazorb  our pharmaceutical candidate for treatment of chronic renal failure in humans  we have licensed all potential pharmaceutical products for animal applications and we have made product sales consisting principally of battery packs and lithium titanate 
future revenues will depend on the success of our contracted projects  the results of our other research and development work  the success of the renazorb and animal application licensees in obtaining regulatory approval for the drugs  or other products  and the success of our marketing efforts with respect to both product sales and technology licenses 
general outlook we have generated net losses in each fiscal year since incorporation 
revenues from product sales  commercial collaborations and contracts and grants increased significantly in but operating expenses also increased as we added employees and committed additional funds to our customer contracts  battery initiative  pigment process technology and sales and marketing efforts 
our gross profit margins on customer contracts for research and development work are very low  and in order that we may be profitable in the long run  our business plan focuses on the development of products and technologies that we expect will eventually bring a substantial amount of higher margin revenues from licensing  manufacturing  product sales and other sources 
we expect our nanosafe nanotitanate battery materials to be a source of such higher margin revenues 
consequently  during  we continued to expand the scope of our amps division by hiring additional staff and increasing temporary personnel to handle production demand leasing additional laboratory and production space in indiana  and acquiring test and production equipment 
as we attempt to significantly expand our revenues from licensing  manufacturing  sales and other sources  some of the key near term events that will affect our long term success prospects include the following we must continue the development work on our nano structured lto electrode materials  produce sufficient quantities of batteries and battery cells for test purposes  obtain satisfactory test results and successfully market the materials 
toward that end  we have hired additional employees  have constructed test and production facilities and are purchasing equipment 
our intent is to initially market our nano structured lto electrode materials to the automotive industry where we must be able to demonstrate to prospective customers that our nano structured lto electrode materials offer significant advantages over existing technologies 
on january   we entered into a multi year purchase and supply agreement with phoenix motorcars  inc for nanosafe nanotitanate battery packs to be used in electric vehicles produced by phoenix 
contemporaneously  phoenix placed a firm purchase order for  in nanosafe nanotitanate battery packs and projected orders for of between and million for the remainder of the agreement provides phoenix with limited exclusivity in the all electric vehicle market during a three year period 
in order to maintain exclusivity  phoenix must purchase at least million in battery packs during phoenix must be successful in their business strategy and we must build and deliver battery packs on a scale we have never before achieved  in order to fully benefit from this purchase agreement 
spectrum and elanco must begin the testing and application processes necessary to receive fda approval of our renazorb and renalan products  respectively 
toward that end  we must manufacture renazorb and renalan under pharmaceutical industry guidelines to augment such testing 
we have commenced and are continuing discussions with western oil sands and other potential partners with regard to licensing our ahp pigment process 
successful completion of such discussions is integral to continuing development of ahp 
although it is not essential that all of these projects be successful in order to permit substantial long term revenue growth  we believe that full commercialization of several of our technologies will be necessary in order to expand our revenues enough to create a likelihood of our becoming profitable in the long term 
we are optimistic with respect to our current key projects  as well as others we are pursuing  but recognize that  with respect to each  there are development  marketing  partnering and other risks to be overcome 
liquidity and capital resources current and expected liquidity our cash and short term investments increased from  at december  to  at december  on december   we sold  of our common shares for net proceeds to us of approximately million 
this increase was offset by cash used to fund operations and purchase fixed assets of approximately million during we intend to use these funds for working capital  capital expenditures  research and development activities and the acquisition of other technologies 
net cash used in operations was  in  and we expect to remain at the same level in based upon budgeted revenues  expenditures  and cashflows 
we currently have contracts in place that are expected to generate approximately  of revenues in  and we expect to substantially add to this amount by entering into new contracts and increasing product sales 
however  this increase in revenues will be dependent on our ability to secure customer contracts and successfully market our nanosafe nanotitanate batteries  nano structured lto  nanocheck  thermal spray  and other products 
during  we continued making significant expenditures for our battery initiative  added staff and equipment for the manufacture of nanoparticle products  increased the capital investment in plant equipment relating to pigment process development and increased our sales and marketing efforts 
in  we intend to increase spending for the battery initiative  manufacturing of the potential drug candidates  and pigment process development 
we estimate that our current cash and short term investments balance is sufficient to support our operations for approximately two years based on budgeted cashflow projections 
historically  we have financed operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities common shares  convertible debentures  stock options and warrants and by the issuance of debt 
in light of our recent public offering and strategic private placement of securities  we do not presently have any plans to pursue additional debt or equity financing during but reserve the right to do so if deemed necessary in connection with an unexpected business opportunity or need 
we do not have any commitments with respect to future financing and may  or may not  be able to obtain such financing on reasonable terms  or at all 
we have a single note payable in the original principal amount of  that does not contain any restrictive covenants with respect to the issuance of additional debt or equity securities by altair 
the first two payments of  of principal plus accrued interest were due and paid on february  and february  future payments of principal and interest are due annually on february  through capital commitments and expenditures the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations and the periods in which payments are due as of december  less than after contractual obligations total year years years years notes payable interest on notes payable contractual service agreements facilities and property leases unfulfilled purchase orders total contractual obligations the major capital expenditures during were  for construction of dry rooms and purchase of equipment for the battery initiative   for production equipment   for pilot plant equipment associated with pigment development   for equipment for the unlv solar hydrogen project  and  of improvements and other capital expenditures at corporate headquarters 
at december   we had  of outstanding commitments for capital additions  of which approximately are for production equipment  and are for equipment being purchased under the university of las vegas grant 
in  we plan to spend approximately million on equipment and leasehold improvements primarily in the life sciences and ahp divisions 
critical accounting policies and estimates management based the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to long lived assets  stock based compensation  revenue recognition  overhead allocation  allowance for doubtful accounts and deferred income tax 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these judgments and estimates affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
changes to these judgments and estimates could adversely affect the company s future results of operations and cash flows 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist principally of the nanomaterials and titanium dioxide pigment assets  the intellectual property patents and patent applications associated with them  and a building 
included in these long lived assets are those that relate to our research and development process 
these assets are initially evaluated for capitalization based on statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for research and development costs 
if the assets have alternative future uses in research and development projects or otherwise  they are capitalized when acquired or constructed  if they do not have alternative future uses  they are expensed as incurred 
at december   the carrying value of these assets was  or of total assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist 
in our evaluation  we estimate the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and recognize impairment when such cash flows will be less than the carrying values 
events or circumstances that could indicate the existence of a possible impairment include obsolescence of the technology  an absence of market demand for the product  and or the partial or complete lapse of technology rights protection 
share based compensation 
we have a stock incentive plan that provides for the issuance of stock options  restricted stock and other awards to employees and service providers 
we calculate compensation expense under sfas r using a black scholes option pricing model 
in so doing  we estimate certain key assumptions used in the model 
we believe the estimates we use  which are presented in note of notes to the consolidated financial statements  are appropriate and reasonable 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or service has been performed  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable  in accordance with the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
during  our revenues were derived from four sources license fees  commercial collaborations  contract research and development and product sales 
license fees are recognized when the agreement is signed  we have performed all material obligations related to the particular milestone payment or other revenue component and the earnings process is complete 
revenue for product sales is recognized upon delivery of the product  unless specific contractual terms dictate otherwise 
based on the specific terms and conditions of each contract grant  revenues are recognized on a time and materials basis  a percentage of completion basis and or a completed contract basis 
revenue under contracts based on time and materials is recognized at contractually billable rates as labor hours and expenses are incurred 
revenue under contracts based on a fixed fee arrangement is recognized based on various performance measures  such as stipulated milestones 
as these milestones are achieved  revenue is recognized 
from time to time  facts develop that may require us to revise our estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative effect of revised estimates is recorded in the period in which the facts requiring revisions become known 
the full amount of anticipated losses on any type of contract is recognized in the period in which it becomes known 
overhead allocation 
facilities overhead  which is comprised primarily of occupancy and related expenses  is initially recorded in general and administrative expenses and then allocated monthly to research and development expense based on labor costs 
facilities overheads allocated to research and development projects may be chargeable when invoicing customers under certain research and development contracts 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of accounts receivable 
we analyze historical bad debts  the aging of customer accounts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
from period to period  differences in judgments or estimates utilized may result in material differences in the amount and timing of our bad debt expenses 
deferred income tax 
income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
future tax benefits are subject to a valuation allowance when management is unable to conclude that its deferred income tax assets will more likely than not be realized from the results of operations 
we have recorded a valuation allowance to reflect the estimated amount of deferred income tax assets that may not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred income tax assets is dependent upon generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based on the historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred income tax assets become deductible  management believes it more likely than not that the company will not realize benefits of these deductible differences as of december  management has  therefore  established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred income tax assets as of december  due to the significant increase in common shares issued and outstanding from through  section of the internal revenue code may provide significant limitations on the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards 
as a result of these limitations  a portion of these loss and credit carryovers may expire without being utilized 
results of operations fiscal year vs 
revenues increased by  from  in to  in  while operating expenses increased by  from  in to  in as a result  our loss from operations increased by  from  in to  in product sales increased from  in to  in due to our first sales of battery packs to phoenix motorcars  inc of the battery packs ordered  four were shipped and seven were billed and held by us based upon the written request of phoenix  which complied with the revenue recognition criteria described in the securities and exhange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
commercial collaborations revenues increased from  in to  in primarily due to  of increased billings to western oil sands resulting from an amendment to their license and development agreement signed in october and an increase of  in renazorb development revenues paid by spectrum pharmaceuticals 
contract and grant revenues increased from  in to  in  principally as a result of billings of  under the million department of energy earmark that was effective in september and  under the  indiana advanced energy technologies program grant awarded in november this increase was partially offset by a reduction in the revenues of  for the august subcontract with western michigan university that was fully expended in february research and development  or r d  expense increased by  from  in to  in during  the battery initiative  which was initially staffed in the fourth quarter of  was expanded over the year to include three new employees and performance of the research to develop and improve our nano structured lto and cell design utilized in the nanosafe nanotitanate batteries 
as a result  expenditures for the battery initiative increased by  in in addition  pre production and commercialization costs relating to lto increased by  we also increased our commitment to pigment process technology in by hiring a full time general manager and developing a pilot plant  with a resulting increase in expenditures of  expenditures for contract and grant work increased by  primarily as a result of the new million department of energy earmark effective in september these increases were partially offset by decreases in other research and development activities 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  from  in to  in excluding the payment of a  fee in to rbc capital markets in connection with the renazorb licensing agreement  sales and marketing expenses increased by  in this increase reflects the addition of two positions on the sales team to focus on the life sciences and amps divisions of  and expenses incurred of  to promote our nanosafe nanotitanate batteries installed in our prototype all electric vehicle and the expansion of general corporate marketing activities 
general and administrative expenses increased by  from  in to  in stock based compensation expense  a non cash item  increased by  as a result of implementing fas r  we incurred approximately  of expenses associated with a flood at our headquarters in reno  nevada in january  legal fees associated with patent work increased by  and payroll expense increased by approximately  due mainly to staff additions 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  in sarbanes oxley compliance costs from  the first year of implementation 
interest income decreased by  from  in to  in on average a higher level of cash was available for investment in fiscal year vs 
revenues increased by  in  from  in to  in  while operating expenses increased by  as a result  our loss from operations increased by  from  in to  in in january  we licensed renazorb to spectrum and received  of license revenues  the first license revenues received by altair 
contract and grant revenues increased from  in to  in  principally as a result of billings under an agreement with the university of nevada  las vegas research foundation that was entered into in november revenues in connection with this agreement increased by approximately  from to commercial collaborations revenues increased from  in to  in due to increased billings to western oil sands for design and construction of a pilot plant and increased staff time spent on the project 
product sales increased from  in to  in as a result of sales of battery materials and thermal spray materials 
r d expense increased by  from  in to  in we made a significant resource commitment to the battery initiative project beginning in early during the fourth quarter of  we hired thirteen employees with extensive scientific  engineering  manufacturing and marketing experience in the battery industry 
as a result  expenditures for the battery initiative increased by  in we also increased our commitment to pigment process technology development with a resulting increase in expenditures of  expenditures for contract and grant work increased primarily as a result of new grants received in late and in expenditures under the national science foundation grant for development of advanced battery materials increased by  in  expenditures under the unlv research foundation grant for development of solar hydrogen generation cells increased by  and expenditures under the western michigan university grant for development of nanosensors increased by  in the scope of work under phase of the western oil sands contract was expanded in and we also constructed a pilot plant for the project 
as a result  charges under the contract increased by  in in april  we entered into a joint venture with bateman engineering nv to promote the development of the pigment process technology and we incurred  of expenses during the year in connection with the venture 
the remaining increase in r d expenditures of approximately  was incurred for management  facilities  equipment and other support functions for r d 
sales and marketing expenses increased by  from  in to  in the increase is due to payment of a  fee to rbc capital markets in connection with the renazorb licensing agreement  increased payroll expense resulting from the addition of five new employees and increased business development activities 
general and administrative expenses increased by  from  in to  in consulting costs incurred to comply with the sarbanes oxley act increased by  in  legal fees associated with patent work and general corporate matters increased by  stock option compensation expense and deferred compensation expense associated with restricted stock issuances  both non cash items  increased by  rents paid for additional laboratory space increased by  utilities increased by  due primarily to increased production and r d activity  payroll expense increased by approximately  due mainly to staff additions and increased labor overhead costs and recruiting  and relocation expense increased by  as a result of staff additions 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in investor relations expense of  resulting from a cutback in our investor relations programs  and a decrease in general consulting of  interest income increased by  from  in to  in due to the significant increase in cash available for investment that was generated through the sale of common shares and the exercise of warrants and options in early item a
