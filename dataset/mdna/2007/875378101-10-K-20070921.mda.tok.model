overview our company and our corresponding customer relationships are organized along men s and women s product lines 
as a result we have two reportable segments men s accessories  consisting of belts  wallets  gift accessories  small leather accessories  neckwear  and sporting goods  and  women s accessories  consisting of belts  wallets  handbags  and gift accessories 
in fiscal it was concluded the women s segment would focus on our core competencies of women s and children s belts  small leather goods  handbags  and gift accessories 
all other product categories in the women s segment  including socks  cold weather accessories  fashion scarves  evening bags  and children s accessories excluding belts  were discontinued 

table of contents the table below presents sales and gross margin data for our reportable segments in thousands of dollars 
other financial information about our segments is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
increase increase decrease decrease net sales men s accessories women s accessories gross margin men s accessories women s accessories gross margin percent of sales men s accessories women s accessories total our sales are generally affected by changes in demand for our product categories volume as well as customer allowances and returns 
sales volume also can impact our gross margins in terms of product mix between mass merchant retailers  which typically sell product at lower price points than department stores  and specialty retailers 
the components of our cost of goods sold and selling  general and administrative expense sg a are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report and incorporated herein by reference 
we include the costs related to our distribution network in sg a while others may include all or a portion of such costs in their cost of goods sold 
consequently  our gross margins may not be comparable to others

table of contents the following table presents our segments selling  general and administrative  and depreciation and amortization expenses  and our interest expense in thousands of dollars 
increase increase decrease decrease selling  general and administrative expense men s accessories women s accessories depreciation and amortization men s accessories women s accessories interest expense challenges and opportunities in fiscal we improved our overall efficiency and profitability with higher profit margins and lower sg a expenses  particularly in our women s accessories segment as the result of restructuring its operations in fiscal we continued to seek higher end products and new distribution channels which we expect will enhance future operating results and entered into license agreements for geno d lucca belts  small leather goods  and sandals and the goodyear tire rubber company gift line 
in addition  we will be distributing the eileen west women s handbags  personal leather goods  and belts beginning in the fall of a slowdown in replenishment orders from one of our largest customers impacted our fourth quarter results and will continue to affect our results in the near term 
unfortunately we have no direct control of this issue 
our assessment of the situation is that the customer s initiative is impacting other apparel and accessories categories and is not unique to us 
we are confident our relationship with the customer continues to be strong  and once its inventory levels are adjusted  we believe we are poised to resume improved profitability 
in the fourth quarter we also experienced an unexpected return of some holiday gift merchandise which typically would have occurred earlier in the fiscal year as some of our retailers opted to continue to sell this merchandise through the spring and returned unsold product during the fourth quarter 
we have taken the necessary steps to prevent this from happening in the future and we are adjusting initial shipments to certain retailers based on our sell through analysis to minimize returns in the future 
the conversion of our men s accessories segment operations in yoakum  texas to a receiving and distribution facility following the cessation of belt manufacturing on june  will result in a significant change in the way we conduct an important part of our business 
we have had an excellent long term relationship with the china based company which is taking over our leather belt manufacturing  but it will be increasingly important to maintain our relationship and deal with longer production to delivery lead times 
on august  we announced our board of directors has undertaken an evaluation of a full range of strategic alternatives available to the company for increasing stockholder value 
these alternatives could include  among other things  adding new licenses  acquisitions  stock buybacks  increased dividends  going private  and selling the company 
we have retained financo  inc  an investment banking firm specializing in the apparel and accessories sector  to assist with the assessment process 
there is no assurance as to what the outcome of the process may be and we do not intend to disclose developments until a specific course of action has been approved by our board of directors 
compared to net sales and gross margins our fiscal net sales  compared to fiscal  were lower as the prior year included million of sales of products by our women s accessories segment which were discontinued as part of restructuring its operations 
belt sales were a greater percentage of our total net sales in fiscal even though holiday sales were slightly softer  as had been expected  and one of our largest customers curtailed replenishment orders in the fourth quarter 

table of contents fiscal net sales by our men s accessories segment improved over fiscal on increased sales of gift accessories million and belts million 
however  the segment s small leather goods holiday sales were lower resulting in annual sales being million below the fiscal level 
in addition to the million for discontinued products in fiscal  belt and handbag sales by the women s accessories segment were each almost million lower in fiscal as the result of competitive market pressures related to the allocation of retail space to accessories and continued weakening of women s fashion accessory trends 
our overall gross margin for fiscal was of net sales compared to in  which was negatively impacted by approximately percentage points attributable to the women s segment provision for discontinued product line inventory in fiscal the margins for our men s accessories segment products  other than gift accessories  were slightly lower this year due to market pressures and more direct shipment sales 
compared to the margin for products other than those which were discontinued  the women s accessories segment fiscal gross margin improved as the result of fewer sales of lower margin handbags and the fiscal gross margin was percentage points lower from the effects of mass merchant sales at lower than normal margins in order to reduce excess inventory 
direct shipments have lower gross margins because these goods are shipped from our suppliers to our customers and are not handled in our distribution centers  thereby reducing the general and administrative costs related to the sales 
any material changes in sales mix  such as higher mass merchant accessory sales or direct shipments  could lower our gross margin percentages during a particular season 
operating expenses fiscal sg a expenses totaling million  including  related to transitioning our yoakum  texas manufacturing operations to overseas partners and other severance costs  were million less than fiscal due to consolidation of the women s segment mass merchant and department store businesses and discontinuing product lines 
payroll costs  including the  and approximately  in fiscal related to restructuring our women s accessories segment  were  lower while contract labor costs in our distribution centers increased  other distribution costs were reduced  from the fiscal level 
the  increase in our men s accessories segment sg a expenses was primarily attributable to increased distribution costs  manufacturing transition costs  and technology support  which were partly offset by lower product development expenses 
lower payroll  distribution  travel  product sample  and rent  costs were the main contributors to the  reduction in the women s accessories segment fiscal sg a expenses 
the fiscal compensation for our executive officers and directors did not increase as  based on the company s financial performance  our board of directors determined that the salaries for fiscal for our president and chief executive officer  chief financial officer  and vice president of operations would remain at the levels established for fiscal  equity compensation awards would not be granted to such officers and no bonuses would be paid to our executive officers for fiscal  and the nonemployee directors would not be granted equity awards 
interest expense for fiscal was  lower than the expense for fiscal due to lower average amounts borrowed million in fiscal vs 
million in fiscal even though average interest rates were higher in fiscal vs 
in fiscal 
royalty and other income for fiscal includes a  gain from the sale of the rights to use one of our trademarks within the republic of mexico 
our fiscal effective income tax rate was compared to the federal statutory rate 
the higher rate is attributable to state income taxes and expense deduction limitations which  net of federal tax benefit accounted for and of the difference  respectively 
the differences between the federal statutory rate and the tax benefit last year are described in the following comparison of fiscal to summary while we had lower net sales in fiscal  primarily due to the decision in fiscal to discontinue a number of our women s accessories segment products  gross margins improved  sg a expenses were reduced  and interest expense was lower 
for the year  we had net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per share  in fiscal 
table of contents compared to restructuring in fiscal we took a hard look at how to improve overall efficiency and profitability  particularly in our women s accessories segment  as the retail environment continued to change with increased competition  higher energy costs  and department store consolidations 
we evaluated the level of contribution from each of our women s product lines in order to improve operating performance and decided to exit from several women s categories that were no longer profitable 
it was concluded the women s segment would focus on our core competencies of women s and children s belts  small leather goods  handbags  and gift accessories 
all other product categories in the women s segment  including socks  cold weather accessories  fashion scarves  evening bags  and children s accessories excluding belts  were discontinued 
a million provision was recorded in the quarter ended march  to write down inventory and packaging to our best estimate of the market value that we expected to realize and positions in our women s dallas distribution facility were eliminated in the discontinued product areas resulting in one time payroll costs of approximately  in the third quarter 
net sales and gross margins the fiscal net sales of our men s and women s accessories segments increased and  respectively  over fiscal s level resulting in million of consolidated sales  or  more than fiscal for the men s accessories segment  fiscal belt sales  which had increased significantly in the prior two years  were slightly less than the prior year 
most of the belt sales decline was offset by increased sales of small leather goods and other products  including men s neckwear 
some of the expected growth in men s accessories did not materialize because of a major customer s decision to reduce its company wide inventories 
the eton gift accessories business sales increased by million in fiscal sales were dampened for our women s accessories segment by competitive market pressures and weakened fashion accessory trends 
while belt sales were up  or million  the gain was partly offset by the decline in sales of other products 
overall the women s accessories segment sales gain for the year was derived from products which have been discontinued as we focused on products having higher profit margins 
our overall gross margin for fiscal was of net sales compared to in approximately percentage points of this decline were attributable to the impact of the women s segment provision for discontinued product line inventory and approximately percentage points of the decline were attributable to product mix 
the men s accessories segment gross margin was off percentage points as the result of more direct shipments of small leather goods which typically have lower margins as well as a million inventory mark down provision in the fourth quarter 
the women s segment gross margin  excluding the effect of the discontinued inventory provision  was percentage points lower from the effects of mass merchant sales at lower than normal margins in order to reduce excess inventory 
operating expenses fiscal sg a expenses were million compared to million in the fiscal expenses were increased by share based compensation of  due to our adoption of sfas no 
r on july  and payroll and inventory relocation expenses of  related to the restructuring of our women s segment 
the overall lower sg a expenses were derived from reduced costs in our women s segment due to consolidation of its mass merchant and department store businesses  as well as reductions in legal  advertising  and travel  expenses 
sg a expenses for our men s segment increased  as increases in distribution costs  including a greater percentage of shared distribution center expenses  product development  and royalties  offset reductions in payroll  advertising  and other costs 
depreciation expense in our men s accessories segment increased primarily as a result of property and equipment additions at our yoakum  texas facility see the following liquidity and capital resources discussion while the women s accessories segment depreciation declined because of asset retirements 
the  goodwill impairment charge in fiscal was the result of assessing the fair value of our women s accessories segment because of changing business conditions for women s mass market merchant sales 

table of contents interest expense in fiscal was  more than fiscal s expense primarily due to our credit facility s increasing interest rates  which ranged from to in fiscal compared to the range of to in fiscal  and additional loan fees in connection with amendments to our credit facility effective september  adjusting certain financial covenant requirements and effective march   among other things  increasing applicable margins for libor based borrowings and amending the definitions of ebitda and fixed charges 
the primary differences between the federal statutory tax rate and the benefit from the fiscal pretax loss are for the goodwill impairment charge that is not deductible for income tax purposes and for state income taxes based on subsidiaries earnings that are not offset by losses incurred in the women s accessories segment 
the impaired goodwill arose from the stock purchase of accessory design group in april summary in fiscal the benefits of increased sales and reduced selling  general and administrative expenses were offset by the million per share charge related to our women s segment discontinued product lines  associated packaging costs  and severance payments  and the  per share goodwill impairment 
the net loss for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources our operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal and million in contributing to the positive cash flow this year were the receipt of an income tax refund million and liquidation of a short term investment million included in other current assets at june  accounts payable increased million in fiscal and were million lower in fiscal compared to due to the timing of inventory purchases for fall and the holiday season 
increases in accounts receivable and inventories used million of our cash provided by operations in fiscal while a million accounts receivable decrease contributed to our fiscal positive cash flow 
the income tax benefits from restricted stock vesting and stock option exercises exceeding the tax benefits of recognized share based compensation expense are included in our statement of cash flows as a financing activity for  and  and operating activities for fiscal  as the result of adopting sfas no 
r on july  fiscal capital expenditures of million for property and equipment were primarily in support of inventory management  other computer related functions  and sales office remodeling 
our fiscal capital expenditures for property and equipment totaling almost million were primarily for computer equipment and software  including the implementation of an additional software module for our enterprise software and additions to the distribution system in our yoakum  texas facility 
in we also expended  for additional warehouse racking and forklifts needed to reconfigure our distribution facilities as part of the restructuring of our product lines 
in fiscal the million spent on property and equipment additions was for new distribution software and related computer hardware in yoakum 
other capital expenditures that year were related to leasehold improvements in our corporate offices 
the property and equipment expenditures in fiscal were partly offset by  in proceeds from selling the rights to use one of our trademarks within the republic of mexico 
in fiscal investing activities included million for the purchase of superior merchandise company described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities and our credit facility which we believe will provide adequate financial resources for our future working capital needs 
information about the credit facility is incorporated herein by reference to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the maximum amount borrowed under the credit facility in fiscal was million in october the million of positive operating cash flows allowed us to reduce our year end notes payable balance by million in fiscal financing activities provided an additional million from the sale of common stock to employees through our stock purchase program and the exercise of stock options 

table of contents we increased our quarterly dividend rate beginning with the fiscal fourth quarter payment and  for the year  we paid a total of  in dividends 
we were in compliance with all the covenants of our credit facility during fiscal as our borrowings increase for the procurement of fall and holiday season inventory  it may be necessary to request a waiver or amendment for certain of those covenants as of the end of fiscal s first quarter due to tightened liquidity resulting from the fourth quarter curtailment of replenishment orders by one of our largest customers which continued in the first part of fiscal off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if the estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made or changes in the estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period  would have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
in addition there are other items within our financial statements that require estimation  but are not deemed critical as defined above 
changes in estimates could have a material impact on our operations and financial position 
we use estimates throughout our consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies and estimates we consider most critical  and a basic sensitivity analysis as to how each relate to our financial statements  are presented below 
revenues and accounts receivable allowances we recognize revenue when merchandise is shipped and title to the goods has passed to the customer 
we record allowances  including cash discounts  in store customer allowances  cooperative advertising allowances  and customer returns  as a reduction of sales based upon historical experience  current trends in the retail industry  and 
table of contents individual customer and product experience 
actual returns and allowances may differ from our estimates and differences would affect the operating results of subsequent periods 
sensitivity analysis the following table presents the estimated effect of the indicated increase decrease in our sales  based on fiscal net sales of million  on our allowance for doubtful accounts in thousands except per share amounts 
changes in general economic conditions  trends and developments within our industry  or situations unique to specific customers could result in significant fluctuations in the actual effects of these estimates 
sales allowances earnings change reserves expense per share change in customer allowances and returns change in allowance for doubtful accounts inventories our inventories are stated at the lower of cost principally standard cost which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
cost includes materials  direct and indirect labor  and factory overhead 
market  with respect to raw materials  is replacement cost and  with respect to work in process and finished goods  is net realizable value 
in our assessment of the value of inventory  we monitor the accumulation of excess inventory at the end of each season 
our assessment is both a quantitative measurement eg  the use of metrics such as the number of months supply on hand and qualitative measurement eg  the ability to utilize certain styles in current and future programs 
in general we have relationships with off price store customers that will purchase excess inventory at discounted prices and we have been able to realize values above cost 
if circumstances arise in which the market value of items in inventory declines below cost  an inventory markdown would be estimated and charged to expense in the period identified 
if we incorrectly anticipate these trends or unexpected events occur  our results of operations could be materially affected 
we closely monitor fashion trend items and anticipate additional inventory markdowns if market indications in fashion trends justify further reserves 
historically such inventory markdowns have generally been within our expectations 
sensitivity analysis the effect of a write down in the value of our june  inventory would be in thousands except per share amounts percentage earnings of inventory inventory expense per share change in inventory markdown goodwill goodwill impairment is measured annually as of june  and when events and circumstances indicate goodwill may not be recoverable  by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit that has goodwill to the unit s carrying value 
goodwill is allocated to reporting unit groups within each of our business segments which focus on the design  procurement  and marketing of related products 
we estimate the fair value of a reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value is determined to be less than the carrying value  the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is computed by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to its assets other than goodwill 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts allocated to the assets other than the goodwill is considered the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the goodwill s implied fair value is compared to its carrying value and any shortfall represents the impairment amount 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of goodwill may not be recoverable 
in evaluating impairment  we estimate the future cash flows expected to be derived from our goodwill 
such evaluations are significantly impacted by estimates of future revenues  costs and expenses  and other factors 
a significant change in future cash flows or the cost of capital could result in a goodwill impairment 
share based compensation when adopting statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r effective july   we selected the modified prospective method instead of restating prior years balance sheets and statements of operations and cash flows as required by the modified retrospective method based on amounts previously recognized in the pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
the fair values of restricted stock and performance unit grants are estimated to be the market price of our common stock on the grant dates and  for performance units  reduced by the present value of estimated future dividends 
the assumptions 
table of contents we use to estimate the fair value of our stock options are based on historical information and current economic conditions 
our estimated fair values would be greater if the expected dividend yield was decreased and the other assumptions were increased 
neither the grant date market values of our stock nor the resulting output of the black scholes option pricing model using our assumptions may be the value ultimately realized by our directors and employees or accurately measure the tax benefits the company may realize 
impact of recently issued accounting standards the information in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report is incorporated herein by reference 
inflation although our operations are affected by general economic trends  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our operating results during the past three fiscal years 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to interest rate risk on our notes payable 
the effect of a increase or decrease in the interest rate on the amount outstanding at of june  could lower or increase our annual pretax operating results by  we do not expect the potential impact of market conditions on the fair value of our indebtedness to be material 
in addition to interest rate risk on our notes payable  we also are exposed to market risk with respect to changes in the global price level of certain commodities used in the production of our products 
we purchase a substantial amount of leather items from third party suppliers 
an unanticipated material increase in the market price of leather could increase the cost of these products to us and  therefore  have a negative effect on our operating results 
market risk related to foreign currency historically has not been material since generally we have negotiated and settled agreements for the products we purchase in us dollars
