the following should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
overview we have completed a series of transactions during the last three years that have significantly impacted our results of operations and financial conditions and transformed the nature and scope of our business 
the most recent of these transactions was our significant purchase of producing properties in the uk in november this transaction coupled with our purchase of an interest in the enoch development 
table of contents endeavour international corporation project in mid and producing properties in norway in late provided a balanced portfolio of oil and gas reserves 
these acquisitions implement the north sea oil and gas strategy that we adopted upon our february restructuring 
throughout the last three years  we have worked to acquire interests in properties in the north sea through licensing rounds in the uk and norway 
the year represents a full year s contribution of the acquired norwegian assets and reflects the initiation of drilling in the united kingdom and the continuation of our efforts to acquire interests in properties in the north sea 
our drilling program continued in the transactions and events impacting the last three years include acquisitions the acquisition of producing properties in the uk for million was completed in november the transaction was financed through the issuance of common stock  preferred stock and debt 
the acquisition of an interest in the enoch development project for million was completed in may the acquisition of the majority interest in oer was completed in november for approximately million 
the acquisition of the remaining minority interest was completed in january for an aggregate consideration paid of million  approximately million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
the nsnv acquisition was completed in february as the nsnv acquisition was accounted for as a purchase of assets and not a business combination  the consideration given was allocated to the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired with the excess of million expensed 
dispositions the sale of our partnership interests in thailand to a private entity for net proceeds of approximately million was completed in the second quarter of we recorded a gain on the sale of these interests of approximately million 
the sale of all of our equity interest in louisiana shelf partners  lp la 
shelf was completed in the second quarter of for  in cash and a million contingent deferred payment that is payable from proceeds from production of drilling activities on the oil and gas leases held by la 
shelf 
we recorded a loss on the sale of these interests of approximately million 
the sale of our entire limited partnership interests in partnership with interests in certain oil and gas leases located in mississippi was completed in the first quarter of for million 
we recorded a gain on the sale of these interests of approximately million 
financing as part of the acquisition of uk producing properties  we issued the following million shares of common stock in the fourth quarter of for million in gross proceeds   shares of series c convertible preferred stock for million in gross proceeds  million in a borrowing base debt facility  before financing costs paid of million  and million in a second lien term loan  before financing costs paid of million 
we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible senior notes due in a private placement during the first quarter of 
table of contents endeavour international corporation we issued million shares of common stock at per share in a private placement in february for estimated net proceeds of million after deduction of offering expenses 
simultaneous with the consummation of the nsnv acquisition and the offering of million shares of common stock  we restructured our non core assets  debt and equity by repaying  converting or repurchasing all outstanding debt and nearly all outstanding preferred stock 
operations the first of our wells in our drilling program  the cygnus prospect  was spud in early february in the uk sector of the north sea 
the well has successfully tested as a gas discovery and is located within close proximity to several potential transportation routes 
in the fourth quarter of  we drilled the columbus exploratory prospect on block f in the central graben region of the north sea 
we served as operator of the well 
in december  we completed successful testing of the well and began evaluations to determine the appropriate appraisal program of this gas and condensate discovery 
in the fourth quarter of  we purchased a percent working interest in the bacchus prospect in the northern part of block a in the central graben region 
the bacchus prospect was drilled in late to test the commercial potential of an oil discovery well that was drilled in while the appraisal well was determined to be dry  evaluations are continuing to determine the commerciality of the field 
in the fourth quarter of  we held an option to purchase a percent working interest in the howgate prospect in block a in the event of a discovery 
we have elected not to purchase the working interest in the howgate prospect 
during the third quarter of  we began drilling on the first wells in our ongoing exploration campaign 
by the end of  we had determined that each of the four wells drilled during in the uk area of the north sea were unsuccessful and recorded million in impairments in and an additional million in with the completion of the oer acquisition in november  we had our first reserves and revenues from properties in the north sea 
represents the first full year contribution of these assets 
results of operations revenues  production and operating costs our revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
our production is sold at prevailing market prices which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control 
given the current tightly balanced supply demand market  small variations in either supply or demand  or both  can have dramatic effects on prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
while the market price received for oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas  oil trades in a worldwide market  whereas natural gas  which has a limited global transportation system  is subject to local supply and demand conditions 
consequently  price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction  while natural gas price movements generally follow local market conditions 
with the advent of more liquefied natural gas facilities  natural gas price movements may also become more global in nature 
the majority of our natural gas is sold in the uk market 
market prices for both oil and natural gas were at historically high levels during revenues increased from to and again for due to higher market prices and the significant impact of our acquisitions discussed above 
for  and  we had production of  boe   boe and  boe  respectively  from assets acquired in the talisman and oer acquisitions 
the following table shows our annual average sales volumes  sales prices and average production costs 
the average sales prices include gains and losses for derivative contracts we utilize to

production costs are costs incurred to operate and maintain our wells and related equipment and include cost of labor  well service and repair  location maintenance  power and fuel  transportation  cost of product and production related general and administrative costs 
total operating costs increased from to and again to as a result of the acquisitions discussed above 
operating costs per boe decreased from per boe for to per boe for due to the full year impact of the oer acquisition which closed in late operating costs per boe for declined slightly due to the lower operating costs per boe for our acquired uk properties

other income expense for was primarily foreign currency exchange gains  while included a million gain on the settlement of an oil commodity swap  partially offset by million in foreign currency exchange losses 
income taxes after the closing of our acquisition of producing properties in the uk in  our income tax expense related primarily to operations in the uk and norway

table of contents endeavour international corporation we have historically funded our operations and acquisitions through issuances of debt and equity securities 
significant issuances of debt and equity  as well as the uses of the proceeds  in  and were as follows in the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the talisman acquisition  we issued million shares of common stock for million in gross proceeds   shares of series c convertible preferred stock for million in gross proceeds  million in a borrowing base debt facility  before financing costs of million  and million in a second lien term loan  before financing costs of million  to acquire producing properties in the uk  in may  we completed the million purchase of an eight percent interest in the enoch field  in the first quarter of  we completed the issuance of million in senior convertible notes due  in january  we purchased the remaining minority interest in oer for an aggregate consideration paid of million  which was approximately million in cash and  shares of our common stock  in november  we purchased oer for million in cash  in february  we issued million shares of common stock and million warrants at an exercise price of per share for net proceeds of million  and in february  we funded the purchase of nsnv through the issuance of million shares of common stock 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our debt 
cash flows used by operating activities were million for as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million for primarily due to higher interest expense in as discussed above and the changes in assets and liabilities between the two periods  partially offset by the higher revenues from the assets acquired in the talisman acquisition 
cash flows provided by operating activities for increased as compared to cash flows provided by operating activities of million for primarily due the full year impact of the assets acquired in the oer acquisition in lat and the changes in assets and liabilities between the two periods 
outlook drilling program we anticipate spending approximately million during to fund oil and gas exploration and development in the north sea 
an estimated million will be allocated to exploration drilling activities and the remainder to data acquisition and analysis and development projects 
more than two thirds of the capital program is expected to be spent in the united kingdom sector of the north sea 
the rest of the capital budget will be directed toward exploration and development activities in norway 
planned capital expenditures for reflect the continuation of our exploratory drilling program and development expenditures for existing operations 
we may increase or decrease our planned activities for or high grade our exploratory prospects  depending upon drilling results  potential acquisition candidates  product prices  the availability of capital resources  and other factors affecting the economic viability of such activities 

table of contents endeavour international corporation rig commitments we have a consortium with several other operators in the norwegian continental shelf that has entered into a contract for the use of a drilling rig for a three year period beginning the second half of the agreement allows us to move forward with our exploration program in norway and fulfill our role as an operator of norwegian licenses 
the contract commits us to days for two wells of drilling services conducted by the bredford dolphin  a semi submersible drilling rig  for approximately million  between late and during the second quarter of  we entered into a rig commitment for days over a one year period beginning in march for the united kingdom sector of the north sea 
the value of this contact is approximately million 
the arrangement is with applied drilling technology international  a division of globalsantafe  and will be for a heavy duty harsh environment jack up suitable for most drilling activities we expect operate in we believe these rig contracting efforts offer compelling economics and facilitate our drilling strategy 
revenues and production with the talisman acquisition  we increased our production to approximately  boe per day for the last two months of based on the number of days we owned talisman 
we expect production for to range from  to  boe per day  reflecting the full year impact of the talisman acquisition and the initial production from the enoch field which is anticipated during the second quarter 
oil prices continued to be impacted by supply and demand on a worldwide basis  while natural gas prices are more impacted by regional economic and weather patterns 
while oil prices have not changed substantially since year end  natural gas prices in the uk  the market for the majority of our gas production  have declined significantly due primarily to warmer weather conditions 
in connection with the talisman acquisition  we entered into commodity derivative instruments to secure our realized prices for a portion of our oil and gas production through see note to the consolidated financial statements herein for more discussion of our commodity derivative instruments 
we expect operating costs per boe to be in the range of to per boe for commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses 
significant commodity price increases  as experienced in recent years  can lead to an increase in drilling and development activities 
as a result  the demand and cost for people  services  equipment and materials may also increase  causing a negative impact on our cash flow 
liquidity and financial resources with our acquisition of interests in seven producing fields in the united kingdom in  we gained a production base that will generate significant cash flow to fund our future growth plans and ongoing operations for as previously discussed  we completed the acquisition of producing properties in the uk in late  financed through the issuance of common stock  convertible preferred stock and debt 
this acquisition significantly increased the size of our production and reserves upon closing and should also provide cash flow to support our ongoing exploration drilling program for the next several years 
annual dividends on the convertible preferred stock are expected to be million  assuming we pay the dividends in stock 
the newly issued debt bears interest at libor plus an applicable margin 
subsequent to  we entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of million whereby we pay a fixed rate of and receive libor 
we expect to have cash interest expense  including the effect of the interest rate swap  of approximately million annually 

table of contents endeavour international corporation management expects exploration successes to be self funding with necessary development expenditures for each project to be funded through a combination of debt  equity  changes in our working interest or other means 
after the closing of our acquisition of producing properties in the uk in  our income tax expense relates primarily to our operations in the uk statutory income tax rate of and to our operations in norway statutory income tax rate of 
we are currently not able to record income tax benefits on our us loss as there is no assurance that we can generate any us taxable earnings 
further  we are only able to record an income tax benefit on interest expense related to approximately million of our long term debt at an effective income tax rate of 
due to our ongoing drilling program and utilization of deferred tax assets  we anticipate that the majority of tax expense  before foreign currency effects  will be deferred tax expense 
our senior bank facility is based on a borrowing base tied to our oil and gas reserves and is subject to redetermination every six months with an independent reserve report required every months 
the initial borrowing base is million  of which million was outstanding at december  the senior bank facility also provides for issuances of letters of credit of up to an aggregate million 
while all letters of credit issued under the senior bank facility will reduce the total amount available for drawing under the senior bank facility  letters of credit issued to secure abandonment liabilities in respect of borrowing base assets will not reduce the amount available under the borrowing base 
as of december   we have million of outstanding letters of credit related to abandonment liabilities on certain of our oil and gas properties 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap and have been presented on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
these accounting principles require management to use estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management reviews its estimates  including those related to the determination of proved reserves  estimates of future dismantlement costs  income taxes and litigation 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes that it is reasonably possible the following material estimates affecting the financial statements could significantly change in the coming year estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  estimates as to the expected future cash flow from proved oil and gas properties  and estimates of future dismantlement and restoration costs 
in addition  alternatives may exist among various accounting methods 
in such cases  the choice of accounting method may also have a significant impact on reported amounts 
our critical accounting policies are as follows full cost accounting under the full cost method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain directly related employee costs and a portion of interest expense  incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas are capitalized and accumulated in pools on a country by country basis 
capitalized costs include the 
table of contents endeavour international corporation cost of drilling and equipping productive wells  including the estimated costs of dismantling and abandoning these assets  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs  seismic and other geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals and costs related to such activities 
employee costs associated with production and other operating activities and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
capitalized costs are limited on a country by country basis the ceiling test 
the ceiling test limitation is calculated as the sum of the present value of future net cash flows related to estimated production of proved reserves  using end of the current period prices including the effect of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  all net of expected income tax effects 
under the ceiling test  if the capitalized cost of the full cost pool  net of deferred taxes  exceeds the ceiling limitation  the excess is charged as an impairment expense 
we utilize a single cost center for each country where we have operations for amortization purposes 
any conveyances of properties are treated as adjustments to the cost of oil and gas properties with no gain or loss recognized unless the operations are suspended in the entire cost center or the conveyance is significant in nature 
unproved property costs include the costs associated with unevaluated properties and properties under development and are not included in the full cost amortization base where proved reserves exist until the project is evaluated 
these costs include unproved leasehold acreage  seismic data  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination  together with interest costs capitalized for these projects 
seismic data costs are associated with specific unevaluated properties where the seismic data is acquired for the purpose of evaluating acreage or trends covered by a leasehold interest owned by us 
significant unproved properties are assessed periodically for possible impairment or reduction in value 
if a reduction in value has occurred  these property costs are considered impaired and are transferred to the related full cost pool 
geological and geophysical costs included in unproved properties are transferred to the full cost amortization base along with the associated leasehold costs on a specific project basis 
costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
costs of dry holes are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful 
unproved properties whose acquisition costs are not individually significant are aggregated  the portion of such costs estimated to be ultimately nonproductive  based on experience  are amortized to the full cost pool over an average holding period 
in countries where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  unevaluated property costs remain capitalized in unproved property cost centers until proved reserves have been established  exploration activities cease or impairment and reduction in value occurs 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of a proved reserve base  amounts in the unproved property cost center are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to amortization and the application of the ceiling test 
when it is determined that the value of unproved property costs have been permanently diminished in part or in whole based on the impairment evaluation and future exploration plans  the unproved property cost centers related to the area of interest are impaired  and accumulated costs charged against earnings 
we capitalize interest on expenditures for significant exploration and development projects while activities are in progress to bring the assets to their intended use 
capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying our weighted average interest rate on debt by the amount of qualifying costs and is limited to gross interest expense 
as costs are transferred to the full cost pool  the associated capitalized interest is also transferred to the full cost pool 

table of contents endeavour international corporation business combinations accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
in connection with the talisman acquisition  we recorded goodwill for the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
our fair value estimates for the acquisition are subject to change as additional information becomes available and is assessed by endeavour 
purchase price allocation the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations  including information commonly considered by our engineers in valuing individual oil and gas properties and sales prices for similar assets 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company s assets and liabilities and carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition 
intangible assets represent the purchase price allocation to the assembled workforce as a result of the acquisition of nsnv  inc we assess the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets by testing the asset for impairment annually at year end  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
dismantlement  restoration and environmental costs we recognize liabilities for asset retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  such as producing well sites  offshore production platforms  and natural gas processing plants  with a corresponding increase in the related long lived asset 
the asset retirement cost is depreciated along with the property and equipment in the full cost pool 
the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value and accretion expense  recognized over the life of the property  increases the liability to its expected settlement value 
if the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes  an adjustment is recorded for both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost 
revenue recognition we use the entitlements method to account for sales of gas production 
we may receive more or less than our entitled share of production 
under the entitlements method  if we receive more than our entitled share of production  the imbalance is treated as a liability at the market price at the time the imbalance occurred 
if we receive less than our entitled share  the imbalance is recorded as an asset at the lower of the current market price or the market price at the time the imbalance occurred 
oil revenues are 
table of contents endeavour international corporation recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price  when delivery has occurred and title has transferred  and if collectibility of the revenue is probable 
derivative instruments and hedging activities from time to time  we may utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows from operations or to hedge the fair value of financial instruments 
we may use derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production or a portion of our variable rate debt to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to price fluctuations 
these transactions are likely to be swaps  collars or options and to be entered into with major financial institutions or commodities trading institutions 
derivative financial instruments are intended to reduce our exposure to declines in the market prices of crude oil and natural gas that we produce and sell  to increases in interest rates and to manage cash flows in support of our annual capital expenditure budget 
regardless of whether the derivative instrument is accounted for as a hedge or not  derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts are recorded at fair market value and included in the balance sheets as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument that is not accounted for as a hedge is included in other income expense as an unrealized gain or loss 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at its inception 
where we intend to account for a derivative as a hedge  we document  at its inception  the hedging relationship  the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge 
the documentation includes the identification of the hedging instrument  the hedged item or transaction  the nature of the risk being hedged  and the method that will be used to assess effectiveness of derivative instruments that receive hedge accounting treatment 
derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reflected at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets 
changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs 
hedge effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly based on total changes in the derivative s fair value 
any ineffective portion of the derivative instrument s change in fair value is recognized immediately in other income expense 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion of  or all of  the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
stock based compensation arrangements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb revised rules that require all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair values 
we adopted these new rules effective january  using the modified prospective method in which the prior period financial statements are not restated 

table of contents endeavour international corporation the share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as an expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation to employees under the intrinsic value method 
we apply the fair value method in accounting for stock option grants to non employees using the black scholes method 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued an interpretation which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements by prescribing a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this new accounting guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of this interpretation to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued a new standard which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are reviewing the interpretation and analyzing the potential impact  if any  of this new guidance 
in september  the securities and exchange commission published guidance requiring registrants to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches  with adjustment required if either method results in a material error 
the provisions are effective for annual financial statements for the first fiscal year ending after november  upon adoption  these provisions had no effect on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
disclosures about contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our obligations and commitments to make future payments under its lease agreements and other long term obligations as of december  amounts in thousands payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt principal interest asset retirement obligations operating leases for office leases and equipment office leases rig commitments total contractual obligations repayment of the initial borrowing base on the senior bank facility is based on reserve estimates  which are reassessed every six months 

table of contents endeavour international corporation assumes a libor rate 
as is common in the oil and gas industry  we operate in many instances through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts  such as rig commitment contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator in the event that the non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk the international scope of our business operations exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets 
as a result  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk due to effects that foreign exchange rate movements have on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign operations 
we operate a centralized currency management operation to take advantage of potential opportunities to naturally offset exposures against each other 
to date  we have addressed our foreign currency exchange rate risks principally by maintaining our liquid assets in interest bearing accounts  until payments in foreign currency are required  but we have not reduced this risk by hedging to date 
commodity price risk we produce and sell crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and regional gas spot market prices which have been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
as a result  our financial results can be significantly impacted as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
we may engage in oil and gas hedging activities to realize commodity prices which we consider favorable

at december   we had no interest rate derivative financial instruments 
subsequent to  we entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of million whereby we pay a fixed rate of and receive three month libor through november a change in basis points on libor would result in a million change in our annual interest expense  given our floating rate debt at december  and giving effect to the interest rate swap entered into after year end
