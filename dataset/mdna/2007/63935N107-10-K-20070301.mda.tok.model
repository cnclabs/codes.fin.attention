a variety of business development and marketing channels are used to communicate directly with current and prospective clients  including on site presentations  industry seminars  and industry specific articles 
new engagements are sought and won by the company s senior and mid level consultants 
future performance will continue to depend on the consultants ability to win new engagements 
a significant portion of new business arises from prior client engagements 
in addition  the company seeks to leverage its client relationships in one business segment to cross sell existing services provided by the other segment 
clients frequently expand the scope of engagements during delivery to include follow on  complementary activities 
in addition  an on site presence affords the company s consultants the opportunity to become aware of  and to help define  additional project opportunities as they are identified 
the company derives its revenues primarily from fees and reimbursable expenses for professional services 
a substantial majority of the company s revenues are generated under hourly rates billed on a time and expense basis 
clients are typically invoiced on a monthly basis  with revenue recognized as the services are provided 
there are also client engagements where the company is paid a fixed amount for its services  often referred to as fixed fee billings 
this may be one single amount covering the whole engagement or several amounts for various phases or functions 
from time to time  the company earns incremental revenues  in addition to hourly or fixed fee billings  which are contingent on the attainment of certain contractual milestones or objectives 
such incremental revenues may cause variations in quarterly revenues and operating results if all other revenues and expenses during the quarters remain the same 
the company s most significant expense is cost of services before reimbursable expenses  which generally relates to costs associated with generating revenues  and includes consultant compensation and benefits  sales and marketing expenses  and the direct costs of training and recruiting the consulting staff

revenues are primarily generated from services performed by the company s consultants  
table of contents therefore  success depends in large part on attracting  retaining and motivating talented  creative and experienced professionals at all levels 
in connection with recruiting  the company employs internal recruiters  retains executive search firms  and utilizes personal and business contacts to recruit professionals with significant subject matter expertise and or consulting experience 
consultants are drawn from the industries the company serves  accounting and other consulting organizations  and top rated colleges and universities 
the company seeks to retain its consultants by offering competitive packages of base and incentive compensation  equity ownership  and benefits 
independent contractors supplement the company s consultants on certain engagements 
the company has found that the practice of retaining independent contractors on a per engagement basis provides flexibility in adjusting professional personnel levels in response to changes in demand for the company s professional services 
in addition to the employees and independent contractors discussed above  the company has acquired and seeks to acquire consulting businesses to add highly skilled professionals and enhance the services offered by the company 
the company believes that the strategy of selectively acquiring consulting businesses and consulting capabilities strengthens its platform  market share and overall operating results 
in connection with recruiting activities and business acquisitions  the company s policy is to obtain non solicitation covenants from senior and some mid level consultants 
many of these covenants have restrictions that extend months beyond the cessation of employment 
the company utilizes these contractual agreements and other agreements to reduce the risk of attrition and to safeguard the company s existing clients  staff and projects

competition the market for consulting services is intensely competitive  highly fragmented  and subject to rapid change 
the market includes a large number of participants with a variety of skills and industry expertise  including general management and information technology consulting firms  as well as the global accounting firms  and other local  regional  national  and international firms 
many of these companies are global in scope and have greater personnel  financial  technical  and marketing resources than the company

item a 
risk factors 
in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k and in the documents incorporated by reference herein  the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating the company and its business 
such factors could have a significant impact on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
the company s inability to retain and  as necessary  strengthen its executive management team would be detrimental to the success of our business 
the company relies heavily on a small group of senior executives and retaining their services is important to our future success 
as the company continues to expand  the executive management will face increasing 
table of contents challenges and the possible need to supplement or expand the existing team  as well as put in place a necessary succession plan 
any failures in this regard could impact  among other factors  the company s revenues  growth and profitability 
the company s inability to retain highly skilled consulting professionals could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company relies heavily on its consulting staff and management team 
the company s success depends  in large part  on its ability to hire  retain  develop and motivate highly skilled professionals 
competition for these skilled professionals is intense and the company s inability to hire  retain and motivate adequate numbers of consultants and managers could have a serious effect on its ability to meet client needs 
a loss of a significant number of its employees could have a serious negative effect on the company 
the company s profitability will suffer if it is not able to maintain current pricing and utilization rates 
the company s revenues  and thereby its profitability  is largely a function of the bill rates charged to clients and the number of hours the company s professionals work on client engagements  defined as the utilization of its professionals 
accordingly  if the company is not able to maintain the pricing for its services or an appropriate utilization rate for its professionals  revenues  project profit margins and the company s profitability will suffer 
pricing pressures could result in changes in pricing policies and project profit margins 
bill rates and utilization rates are affected by a number of factors  including management s ability to predict future demand for services and maintain the appropriate headcount without significant underutilized personnel  management s ability to transition employees from completed projects to new engagements  the company s clients perceptions of its ability to add value through its services  the pricing of services rendered by the company s competitors  the market demand for the services provided by the company  the company s ability to manage attrition rates  and management s ability to manage significantly larger and more diverse workforces as the company increases the number of its professionals and executes its growth strategies 
the company s use of equity based compensation could impact its ability to attract  retain and motivate key employees  if the company s stock price declines 
any excessive volatility or decline in the market price of the company s common stock could impair the company s ability to use equity based compensation to attract  retain and motivate key employees 
compensation and retention related issues represent a continuing challenge for the company 
the company faces significant challenges in achieving and managing growth 
failure to meet these management challenges could have a material adverse effect on the future profitability of the company 
the increased scale and complexity of the company s businesses may require additional management systems that the company may not be able to implement in a timely manner 
the challenges of achieving and managing sustained growth may cause strain on the company s management team and the company s systems 
if the company is unsuccessful in meeting these challenges  this may impair the company s financial results  competitive position and ability to retain its professionals 
the company may be exposed to potential risks if the company is unable to achieve and maintain effective internal controls 
in the course of management s evaluation of the effectiveness of the company s internal control over financial reporting as of december   the company identified one material weakness  as described in 
table of contents item a  controls and procedures 
if the company fails to achieve and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting or fails to implement necessary new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use  the company may fail to meet its public reporting requirements on a timely basis  or be unable to adequately report on its business and the results of operations 
this could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company s stock 
finally  the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud  regardless of the adequacy of those controls 
also  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
regulatory and legislative changes affecting the company  its clients  competitors  or staff could have an impact on the company s business 
many of the company s clients are in highly regulated industries such as the healthcare  energy  financial institutions and insurance industries 
regulatory and legislative changes in these industries could impact the market for the company s service offerings and could render its current service offerings obsolete 
in addition  regulatory and legislative changes could impact the competition for consulting services 
this change could either increase or decrease the company s competitive position compared with the company s competitors 
the company s client engagements are generally short term in nature  less than one year  and may be terminated 
the company s inability to attract business from new or existing clients could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the company s inability to continually replace a significant portion of current engagements with new engagements would have an adverse effect on the company s ability to meet its current and future commitments 
many of the client engagement agreements can be terminated by the company s clients with little or no notice and without penalty 
for example  in engagements related to litigation  if the litigation is settled  our engagement for those services usually is no longer necessary and is promptly terminated 
the company also is retained by clients where the work involves multiple engagements or stages 
in such engagements  there is a risk that a client may choose not to retain the company for additional stages of an engagement or that a client will cancel or delay additional planned engagements 
the company s engagements are usually relatively short term in comparison to its office related expenses and other infrastructure commitments 
additionally  the above mentioned factors limit the company s ability to predict future revenues and required professional staffing 
if the company inaccurately predicts its future revenues or professional staffing needs  this can impact its financial results 
the company s client engagements and revenues are frequently event driven and therefore difficult to forecast 
in the past  the company has derived significant revenues from events as inherently unpredictable as the california energy crisis  the sarbanes oxley act of  and hurricane katrina 
such events  in addition to being unpredictable  often have impacts that decline over time as clients adjust to and compensate for such challenges 
these factors limit the company s ability to predict future revenues and required professional staffing  which can impact its financial results 
the company has invested in specialized systems  processes and intellectual capital for which the company may fail to recover its investment or which may become obsolete 
specialized systems and processes have been developed by the company and provide a competitive advantage in serving current clients and obtaining new clients 
additionally  many of the company s service offerings rely on technology that is subject to rapid change 
the company s intellectual capital  in certain service offerings  may be rendered obsolete due to new governmental regulation 

table of contents the company s unsuccessful client engagements could result in damage to its professional reputation or legal liability which could have a material adverse effect on the company 
the professional reputation of the company and its consultants is critical to the company s ability to successfully compete for new client engagements and attract or retain professionals 
any factors that damage the company s professional reputation could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
in addition  the company s engagements are subject to the risk of legal liability 
any public assertion or litigation alleging that the company s services were negligent or that the company breached any of its obligations to a client could expose the company to significant legal liabilities  could distract its management and could damage its reputation 
the company carries professional liability insurance  but such insurance may not cover every type of claim or liability that could potentially arise from the company s engagements 
in addition  the limits of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover a particular claim or a group of claims  and the costs of defense 
some of the work that the company does involves greater risk than ordinary consulting engagements 
the company does work for clients that for financial  legal or other reasons may present higher than normal risks 
while the company attempts to identify such higher risk engagements and higher risk clients in time to avoid unnecessary risks or to limit our potential exposure  these efforts may be ineffective and a professional error or omission in one or more of these higher risk engagements could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition 
examples of such higher risk engagements include  but are not limited to interim management engagements  usually in hospitals and other healthcare providers  expert witness engagements  corporate restructuring engagements  both inside and outside bankruptcy proceedings  engagements where the company delivers a fairness opinion  engagements where the company delivers a compliance effectiveness opinion  engagements where the company delivers an actuarial opinion with respect to insurance company loss reserves  and  engagements involving independent consultant s reports in support of bond financings 
as the company becomes larger  the company increasingly encounters professional conflicts of interest 
as the company becomes larger  the potential for conflicts of interest also increases 
if the company is unable to accept new engagements for any reason  including a conflict of interest  our consultants may become underutilized or discontented  which may adversely affect our revenues and results of operations for future periods and may also create challenges for the company in retaining such consultants 
in addition  although the company has systems and procedures to identify potential conflicts prior to accepting each new engagement  those systems are not fool proof and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our reputation and professional liability 
the company cannot be assured that it will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to consummate future acquisitions or to meet required working capital needs 
the company maintains a revolving line of credit agreement to assist in funding short term and long term cash requirements from normal operations 
this agreement contains certain covenants requiring  among other things  certain levels of interest and debt coverage 
poor performance of the company could cause the company to be in default of these covenants 
in addition  the current agreement may not be sufficient to meet the future needs of the business if a decline in financial performance occurs 
there can be no assurance that the company 
table of contents will be able to raise capital or obtain debt financing to effect future acquisitions or to otherwise meet its working capital needs 
furthermore  if the financial condition of the company s clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments to the company  the company and its financial results would be adversely impacted  which could result in all of the effects described above 
the company may not be able to acquire businesses in the future and already acquired business may not achieve expected results 
the company has developed its business  in part  through the acquisition of complementary businesses 
there has been increasing competition for acquisition targets  as possible acquirers also seek to expand their businesses through acquisitions 
the increased competition may continue to make it more difficult for the company to complete acquisitions or to complete acquisitions on as favorable terms as in the past 
those factors may also make it more difficult to achieve an acceptable return of its capital on certain business acquisitions 
the financing of acquisitions through cash  borrowings or common stock could also impair liquidity or cause significant stock dilution 
the company may not be able to effectively integrate the businesses it acquires  which may adversely affect the company 
the substantial majority of the purchase price the company pays for acquired businesses is related to intangible assets 
the company may not be able to realize the value of those assets or otherwise realize anticipated synergies unless it is able to effectively integrate the businesses it acquires 
the company faces multiple challenges in integrating acquired businesses and their personnel  including differences in corporate cultures and management styles  conflict issues with clients  and the need to divert managerial resources that would otherwise be dedicated to the company s existing businesses 
any failure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could adversely affect the financial performance of the company 
the company s work with governmental clients has inherent risks related to the governmental contracting process 
the company does work for various municipal  state and federal entities and agencies 
these projects have risks that include  but are not limited to  the following government entities reserve the right to audit the company s contract costs  including allocated indirect costs  and conduct inquiries and investigations of the company s business practices with respect to government contracts 
if the government finds that the costs are not reimbursable  then the company will not be allowed to bill for them  or the cost must be refunded to the government if it has already been paid to the company 
findings from such an audit also may result in being required to prospectively adjust previously agreed rates for work and affect future margins 
if a government client discovers improper or illegal activities in the course of audits or investigations  the company may become subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  which may include termination of contracts  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with other agencies of that government 
the inherent limitations of internal controls may not prevent or detect all improper or illegal activities  regardless of the adequacy of such controls 
government contracts  and the proceedings surrounding them  are often subject to more extensive scrutiny and publicity than other commercial contracts 
negative publicity related to our government contracts  regardless of its accuracy  may further damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts 

table of contents the impact of any of the occurrences or conditions described above could affect not only the company s relationship with the particular government agency involved  but also other agencies of the same or other governmental entities 
depending on the size of the project or the magnitude of the potential costs  penalties or negative publicity involved  any of these occurrences or conditions could have a material adverse effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the company is subject to unpredictable risks of litigation 
although the company seeks to avoid litigation whenever possible  from time to time the company is party to various lawsuits and claims in the ordinary course of business 
such disputes may arise  for example  from client engagements  employment issues  regulatory actions  corporate acquisitions  real estate and other business transactions 
the costs and outcome of those lawsuits or claims cannot be predicted with certainty  and may be worse than we can foresee 
the outcome of such lawsuits and claims could have a material adverse effect on the company
