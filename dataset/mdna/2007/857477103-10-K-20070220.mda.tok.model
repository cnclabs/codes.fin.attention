the highlights are as follows each category of revenue  as reported in our consolidated statement of income  increased in double digits compared to  with the exception of processing fees and other revenue 
we achieved positive operating leverage for compared to our investment management business  state street global advisors  or ssga  increased its contribution to our consolidated results of operations to approximately of consolidated total revenue and approximately of consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes for  compared to and  respectively  for we grew the proportion of our non us revenue to approximately of consolidated total revenue  from approximately for we ended with record levels of assets under custody and assets under management 
we exceeded our operating basis financial goals for concerning growth in total revenue  growth in earnings per share from continuing operations and return on shareholders equity from continuing operations  all compared to our financial results for are summarized in the following financial highlights section  followed by a more detailed discussion in the consolidated results of operations section of this management s discussion and analysis 
financial highlights for  we recorded income from continuing operations of billion  or per diluted share  a increase from million  or per diluted share  for total revenue increased from  and return on equity from continuing operations was 
overall results for included net income from discontinued operations of million pre tax income of million reduced by related tax expense of million  or 
per share  the result of the finalization of certain legal  selling and other costs recorded in connection with our divestiture of bel air investment advisors llc 
our results for included a net loss from discontinued operations of million million charge reduced by related tax benefit of million  related to our commitment to divest bel air 
total revenue for grew from  with about three quarters of the growth generated from existing customers 
total fee revenue for  which grew  reflected consistent growth throughout the year in servicing and management fees  up and  respectively  compared to generally  servicing fees benefited from our continued expansion overseas and our cross selling of services to our broad customer base  while management fees benefited from the strategic introduction of quantitative active products  which provide higher margin revenue 
trading services revenue  which benefited from strong capital markets in the first half of  grew year over year 
securities finance revenue  which peaked in the second quarter and declined in the third quarter as a result of seasonality  benefited from increases in volumes of securities loaned  and for the full year increased from we continued to cross sell our existing customer relationships and to introduce new products and services to existing and new customers 
net interest revenue increased compared to  and net interest margin increased to from 
this growth was the result of several favorable trends the balance sheet repositioning we began to execute in late  higher yields on the re investment of securities as they matured  growth in our average balance sheet due to increased customer activity  a more favorable mix of customer deposits  particularly non us deposits  and the absence of increases in short term interest rates by the federal reserve during the second half of the year 
we accomplished the repositioning of the balance sheet without adversely affecting the credit profile of our investment portfolio  and at year end had about of the portfolio invested in aaa or aa rated securities  with invested in aaa rated securities  compared to and  respectively  at year end total operating expenses increased from  as we continued to carefully balance consistent expense management with revenue growth 
most of the increase was the result of increased incentive compensation due to our improved performance and increased headcount to support new business  particularly internationally 
as a result  we generated positive operating leverage of almost basis points on an annual basis  which we define as a rate of total revenue growth that exceeds the rate of growth of total operating expenses 
ssga is increasingly becoming a more significant contributor to our overall results  as that business comprised about of our total consolidated revenue and about of our total income from continuing operations before income taxes for  compared to and  respectively  for  and achieved a pre tax operating margin of  up from for net new business at ssga was about billion  with about two thirds in active management products  such as enhanced indexing  hedge fund strategies and active quantitative management 
we continue to expand our business outside of the us  particularly in europe and the asia pacific region 
for  approximately of our consolidated total revenue was generated from non us activities  up from approximately for  and at year end we employed  outside the us our goal is to eventually generate of our consolidated total revenue from outside the united states 
assets under custody and assets under management both increased to record levels at year end  with assets under custody at trillion  up from trillion a year ago  and assets under management at trillion  up from trillion a year ago 
assets under custody have grown at a compound annual rate of since year end  with us assets growing by and us assets growing by  while assets under management have grown at a compound annual rate of over the same period 
financial goals in early  we reaffirmed our financial goals for state street for these financial goals were growth in operating basis revenue of between and  growth in operating basis earnings per share from continuing operations of between and  and operating basis return on shareholders equity from continuing operations of between and 
operating basis results  as defined by management  include fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue  reflecting tax equivalent adjustments of million and million for and  respectively  and a corresponding charge to income tax expense  and for  exclude aggregate tax related adjustments of million  or 
per share 
the tax adjustments related to additional provisions that resulted from the impact of the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act and issues with respect to certain of our leveraged leases 
management measures our financial goals and related results on an operating basis to provide financial information that is comparable from period to period  and to present comparable financial trends with respect to our ongoing business operations 
the use of fully taxable equivalent net interest revenue facilitates the comparison of revenues from both taxable and non taxable sources 
the previously described tax related adjustments are not part of our normal ongoing business operations  and as a result prevent a meaningful comparison of earnings per share and return on shareholders equity with that of other periods 
management believes that operating basis financial information facilitates an investor s understanding and analysis of state street s underlying performance and trends in addition to financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
for  we exceeded our financial goals 
we increased our operating basis earnings per share from continuing operations by  from to up from to on a gaap basis  including the tax related adjustments 
our operating basis revenue increased from billion to billion including taxable equivalent adjustments of million for and million for  and we recorded operating basis return on shareholders equity from continuing operations of on a gaap basis  including the tax related adjustments 
outlook our long term financial goals remain the same  but based on our recently announced agreement to acquire investors financial  we have adjusted our financial goals for to the following  assuming the acquisition closes in july growth in operating basis revenue of between and  growth in operating basis earnings per share from continuing operations of between and  and operating basis return on shareholders equity from continuing operations of between and 
operating basis results for will exclude merger  integration and restructuring charges related to the above mentioned acquisition  and for will exclude the previously discussed tax related adjustments 
some of the factors and assumptions that we considered in determining this outlook for were as follows expected equity market growth  based on s p and or msci eafe indices  of about  growth in revenue generated from active quantitative asset management products  relatively stable domestic interest rates  the expected flattening of the us dollar yield curve  the continuation of beneficial trends in non us interest rates  modest growth in non us deposits  as well as the maintenance of a favorable mix of customer deposits  including demand deposits  a stable income tax and regulatory environment  shareholder and regulatory approvals of the investors financial acquisition  achievement of expected cost savings from the acquisition  and retention of  and success in cross selling to  investors financial s customer base

we are consistently gaining business globally  and for  our non us revenue was approximately of our total revenue  compared to for we provide a broad range of reliable  easy to integrate investment services that are global and enable our customers to develop and launch competitive new investment products 
we also provide active management products  including enhanced indexing  hedge fund strategies and quantitative management  and passive investment management products and strategies 
we provide fund accounting  custody  investment management  securities finance  transfer agency services  and operations outsourcing for investment managers and hedge fund managers 
these services support the complex financial strategies and transactions of our customers worldwide  in any time zone across multiple currencies 
our focus on the total needs of the customer allows us to develop active  long term relationships that result in high customer retention  cross selling opportunities and recurring revenue 
the servicing markets in which we compete are very price competitive  and we consistently focus on winning and retaining customer business 
this focus requires a strong commitment to customers while constantly working toward providing services at lower costs 
our broad range of services generates fee revenue and net interest revenue 
fee revenue generated by investment servicing and investment management is augmented by securities finance  trading services and other processing fee revenue 
we earn net interest revenue from customers deposits and short term investment activities  by providing deposit services and short term investment vehicles  such as repurchase agreements and commercial paper  to meet customers needs for high grade liquid investments  and investing these sources of funds and additional borrowings in assets yielding a higher rate 
fee revenue servicing and management fees are the largest components of fee revenue  and collectively comprised approximately of total fee revenue for and these fees are a function of several factors  including the mix and volume of assets under custody and assets under management  securities positions held and the volume of portfolio transactions  and the types of products and services used by customers  and are affected by changes in worldwide equity and fixed income valuations 
generally  servicing fees are impacted  in part  by changes in daily average valuations of assets under custody  while management fees are impacted by changes in month end valuations of assets under management 
additional factors  such as transaction volumes  balance credits  customer minimum balances and other factors may have a significant impact on servicing fee revenue 
generally  management fee revenue is more sensitive to market valuations than servicing fee revenue 
in addition  performance fees have become a larger component of management fee revenue over the past two years  and amounted to about of management fees for performance fees are generated when the performance of managed funds exceeds benchmarks specified in the management agreements 
in light of the above  we estimate  assuming all other factors remain constant  that a increase or decrease in worldwide equity values would result in a corresponding change in our total revenue of approximately 
if fixed income security values were to increase or decrease by  we would anticipate a corresponding change of approximately in our total revenue 
the following table presents selected equity market indices 
daily averages and the averages of month end indices demonstrate worldwide equity market valuation changes that impact servicing and management fee revenue  respectively 
year end indices impact the value of assets under custody and management at those dates

products and services include custody  product and participant level accounting  daily pricing and administration  recordkeeping  investment manager and hedge fund manager operations outsourcing services  master trust and master custody  and performance  risk and compliance analytics

we have more than billion in assets under administration in the asia pacific region  and are a leader in japan with more than of the trust assets held by non domestic trust banks 
at year end  our total assets under custody were trillion  compared to trillion a year earlier 
the value of assets under custody is a broad measure of the relative size of various markets served 
changes in the value of assets under custody do not necessarily result in proportional changes in revenue 
assets under custody consisted of the following at december assets under custody as of december  agr cagr dollars in billions mutual funds collective funds pension products insurance and other products total mix of assets under custody as of december  in billions financial instrument mix equities fixed income short term and other investments total geographic mix of assets under custody as of december  in billions united states other americas europe middle east africa asia pacific total management fees we provide a broad range of investment management strategies  specialized investment management advisory services and other financial services for corporations  public funds  and other sophisticated investors 
these services are offered through state street global advisors  or ssga  a division of state street 
based upon assets under management  ssga is the largest manager of institutional assets worldwide  the largest manager of assets for tax exempt organizations primarily pension plans in the united states  and the fourth largest investment manager overall in the world 
ssga offers a broad array of investment management strategies  including passive and active  such as enhanced indexing and hedge fund strategies  using quantitative and fundamental methods for both us and global equities and fixed income securities 
ssga also offers exchange traded funds  or etfs  such as the spdr dividend etfs 
the million increase in management fees from primarily resulted from higher equity market valuations and net new business 
in addition  performance fees increased from million in to million in management fees generated from customers outside the united states were approximately of total management fees  up from for at year end  assets under management were trillion  compared to trillion at year end while certain management fees are directly determined by the value of assets under management and the investment strategy employed  management fees reflect other factors as well  including our relationship pricing for customers who use multiple services  and the benchmarks specified in the respective management agreements related to performance fees 
accordingly  there is not necessarily a direct correlation between the value of assets under management  market indices and management fee revenue

we have exclusive ownership of fx connect  the world s first and leading foreign exchange trading platform  and we provide quantitatively based research into investor behavior  as well as consultative services that use quantitative tools designed to optimize our customers returns 
foreign exchange trading revenue is influenced by three principal factors the volume and type of customer foreign exchange transactions  currency volatility and trend  and the management of currency market risks 
for  foreign exchange trading revenue increased  to million from million in  and benefited from a strong first half of the year 
the increase from resulted from increased transaction volumes  a favorable transaction mix related to custody fx services  and an increase in fx trading profits  partially offset by a decline in customer volume weighted currency volatility 
we also offer a range of brokerage and other trading products tailored specifically to meet the needs of the global pension community  including transition management  commission recapture and self directed brokerage 
these products are differentiated by our position as an agent of the institutional investor 
brokerage and other trading fees were million in  up compared to growth was attributable to a significant increase in other trading services and trading profits  offset by a slight decrease in brokerage revenue  the result of a decline in commission recapture revenue 
securities finance securities finance provides liquidity to the financial markets and an effective means for customers to earn revenue on their existing portfolios 
by acting as a lending agent and coordinating loans between lenders and borrowers  we lend securities and provide liquidity in more than markets around the world 
borrowers provide collateral in the form of cash or securities to state street in return for loaned securities 
for cash collateral  we pay a usage fee to the provider of the cash collateral  and invest the cash collateral in certain investment vehicles 
the spread between the yield on the investment vehicle and the usage fee paid to the provider of the collateral is split between the lender of the securities and state street as agent 
for non cash collateral  the borrower pays a fee for the loaned securities  and the fee is split between the lender of the securities and state street 
securities finance revenue has historically been affected by seasonality during the year  and is principally a function of the volume of securities loaned and the interest rate spreads earned on the collateral 
during  securities finance revenue peaked in the second quarter  as a result of heavy borrowing demand from customers  declined in the third quarter  and rebounded slightly in the fourth quarter 
overall  securities finance revenue increased from a year earlier 
growth in this revenue over resulted from a increase in securities lending volumes 
consolidated spread was essentially unchanged from the prior year 
processing fees and other processing fees and other revenue includes diverse types of fees and other revenue  including fees from our structured products business  fees from software licensing and maintenance  profits and losses from unconsolidated subsidiaries  gains and losses on sales of leased equipment and other assets  and amortization of investments in tax advantaged financings 
processing fees and other revenue decreased from  with the decline partially due to the absence of fees from deutsche bank ag related to customer deposits of the acquired global securities services  or gss  business  which were converted to our systems in prior years

on the asset side  there was an increase in average interest earning assets as well as higher yields on our investment securities portfolio 
the higher yields were the result of a higher interest rate environment as well as a repositioning program begun in late and substantially completed in the second half of on the liability side  a higher level of customer deposits  primarily resulting from the growth of our non us operations  as well as a more favorable mix of deposits  also contributed to the growth in net interest revenue 
these benefits were partially offset by the impact of higher funding costs  as the federal reserve raised short term interest rates during the first half of the year 
for the year ended december   our average investment securities portfolio increased from approximately billion to approximately billion 
the portfolio included a higher percentage of collateralized mortgage obligations and floating rate  asset backed securities compared to a year earlier  and a lower percentage of us treasuries and direct obligations of federal agencies 
the shift in the portfolio was designed to better position us in a rising short term interest rate environment  without adversely affecting overall risk  as we continued to invest conservatively in aa and aaa rated securities 
aa and aaa rated securities comprised approximately of the investment securities portfolio  with approximately aaa rated  at december  several factors could affect future levels of net interest revenue and margin  including the federal reserve s ongoing actions to manage short term interest rates  the level and pace of changes in non us rates  particularly by the european central bank and the bank of england  the mix of customer liabilities  and the shapes of the various yield curves around the world 
gains losses on sales of available for sale securities  net our management of the investment securities portfolio has many objectives  the foremost of which is to generate maximum return with modest duration and credit risk 
in addition  we structure the portfolio to provide liquidity and to serve as a source of collateral for customer activities 
these objectives may entail strategic sales of specific securities as market conditions warrant 
we recorded net gains of million on sales of available for sale securities for  compared to net losses of million for at december   approximately of the investment securities portfolio  or billion  was classified as available for sale

staffing levels increased to support growth in our investment servicing business  particularly in europe  and in our investment management business  as well as in information technology and risk management 
the slight increase in information systems and communications expense primarily resulted from higher telecommunications costs and third party software expenditures to support overseas growth 
transaction processing services expenses are volume related  and include equity trading services and fees related to securities settlement  sub custodian fees and external contract services 
the increase primarily resulted from higher transaction volumes  as well as expansion of our operations in europe 
occupancy expense was down from  primarily due to the absence of the million charge recorded in related to a long term sub lease agreement for space in our headquarters building  offset by a slight increase in energy and other utility costs 
the increase in other expenses from primarily resulted from increased costs to support growth initiatives  offset by a decline in professional services fees related to information technology and the restructuring of our global treasury function  which occurred in income taxes the increase in income tax expense from continuing operations to million for  from million a year ago  resulted from increased pre tax earnings  as well as million of aggregate adjustments recorded during primarily related to the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act and the potential resolution of issues with the irs with respect to certain of our leveraged leases

occupancy expense for reflected a million pre tax charge related to a long term sub lease agreement with an unrelated third party for space in our headquarters building 
occupancy expense for reflected a loss of million from a sub lease agreement at our former headquarters building 
aside from these charges  the increases year over year reflected increased occupancy costs in europe to accommodate new investment manager operations outsourcing customers 
the decline in other operating expenses was primarily due to the absence of merger and integration costs of million recorded in related to the conversion of customers gained in the gss acquisition to our systems  and the absence of restructuring costs of million related to severance and benefit costs associated with a position workforce reduction

significant accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item the majority of these accounting policies do not involve difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates in their application  or the variability of the estimates is not material to the consolidated financial statements 
however  certain of these accounting policies  by their nature  require management to make judgments  involving significant estimates and assumptions  about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  and changes in this information over time could materially impact amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses reported in subsequent financial statements 
based on the sensitivity of reported financial statement amounts to the underlying policies  estimates and assumptions  the relatively more significant accounting policies applied by state street have been identified by management as accounting for lease financing  accounting for goodwill  accounting for income taxes  and accounting for pension costs 
these policies require the most subjective or complex judgments  and related estimates and assumptions could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
an understanding of the judgments  estimates and assumptions underlying these accounting policies is essential in order to understand our reported consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a brief discussion of the above mentioned significant accounting policies 
management of state street has discussed these significant accounting estimates with the examining and audit committee of our board of directors  or board 
lease financing we have a leveraged lease portfolio consisting of us and cross border financings  primarily for transportation equipment  including trains  aircraft and ships 
lease financing investments are reported at the aggregate of lease payments receivable and estimated residual values  net of non recourse debt and unearned income 
unearned income is recognized in interest revenue to yield a level rate of return on the net investment in the leases 
measuring the net investment and interest revenue related to lease financing requires the use of several assumptions regarding estimates of residual values  the amount and timing of cash flows  and the impact of income tax regulations and income tax rates relating to the leases 
due to the complexity and long term nature of many of these leases  these assumptions are reviewed regularly for adjustments that may be required  including the recognition of other than temporary impairment of residual values 
changes in these assumptions in future periods could affect asset balances and related interest revenue  as well as the amount of income tax expense 
certain of these assumptions could be affected by changes in tax positions established with respect to the amount and timing of tax deductions taken with respect to certain lease transactions  which could be impacted by the enactment of tax legislation or changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws by us and us tax authorities 
as we discussed in the income taxes section of this management s discussion and analysis  we recorded additional income tax expense of million during  as a result of the impact of the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act and changes in tax positions that we established with respect to certain of our leveraged lease transactions 
additional information about lease financing balances is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item goodwill goodwill arises when the purchase price exceeds the assigned value of net assets of acquired businesses  and represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements being acquired 
almost all of our goodwill resulted from business acquisitions of our investment servicing line of business 
approximately of the total goodwill recorded in our consolidated statement of condition was recorded by this business line  and the remaining was recorded by investment management 
the sustained value of the majority of this goodwill is supported ultimately by revenue from our investment servicing business 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth  or our inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods  could lead to a perceived impairment of goodwill  which would be evaluated and  if necessary  be recorded as a write down of the reported amount of goodwill through a charge to earnings in our consolidated statement of income 
on an annual basis  or more frequently if circumstances dictate  management reviews goodwill and evaluates events or other developments that may indicate impairment in the carrying amount 
we perform this evaluation at the reporting unit level  which is one level below our two major business lines 
the evaluation methodology for potential impairment is inherently complex and involves significant management judgment in the use of estimates and assumptions 
we evaluate impairment using a two step process 
first  we compare the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
if the fair value exceeds the carrying amount  no impairment exists 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  then we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value  then goodwill impairment is recognized by writing the goodwill down to the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of the goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit  as if the unit had been acquired in a business combination and the overall fair value of the unit was the purchase price 
to determine the aggregate fair value of the reporting unit being evaluated for goodwill impairment  we use one of two principal methodologies external or independent valuation  using quoted market prices in active markets  or an analysis of comparable recent external sales or market data  such as multiples of earnings or similar performance measures 
in limited circumstances  these methodologies are not available  and as such  we estimate future cash flows using present value techniques 
events that may indicate goodwill impairment include significant or adverse changes in the business  economic or political climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  and a more likely than not expectation that we will sell or otherwise dispose of a business to which the goodwill relates 
our goodwill impairment testing for indicated that none of our goodwill was impaired 
goodwill recorded in our consolidated statement of condition at december  totaled approximately billion 
additional information about goodwill is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our overall tax position is fundamentally complex  and management judgment is involved in the analysis of income tax assets and liabilities 
we are subject to the income tax laws of the us  its states and municipalities and those of the foreign jurisdictions in which state street operates 
these tax laws can be subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the taxing authorities 
in establishing a provision for income tax expense  we must make judgments and interpretations about the application of these inherently complex tax laws 
disputes over interpretations of the tax laws may be adjudicated by the court systems of the various tax jurisdictions or may be settled with the taxing authority upon examination or administrative appeal 
management s determination of the likelihood that deferred tax assets can be realized is subjective and involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the realization of deferred tax assets arises from carrybacks to prior taxable periods  future taxable income  including foreign source income  and the achievement of tax planning strategies 
underlying estimates and assumptions can change over time  influencing our overall tax positions  as a result of unanticipated events or circumstances 
management continually monitors and evaluates the worldwide impact of tax legislation  decisions  rulings and other current developments on the estimates and assumptions underlying our calculations of current and deferred taxes and our analysis of the expected realization of deferred tax assets 
additional information about income taxes is in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension costs we maintain a tax qualified non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all domestic employees  as well as certain non us defined benefit plans 
measuring cost and reporting liabilities resulting from defined benefit pension plans requires the use of many assumptions  including estimates of future interest rates  asset returns  compensation increases and other actuarial based projections relating to the plans 
pension related estimates have a significant impact on the determination of pension obligations and related expense 
we use december as a measurement date for our pension asset and projected benefit obligation balances 
each year  we review actual demographic and investment experience with the plans actuaries 
in addition to actual experience  adjustments to assumptions consider published interest rate indices  known compensation trends and policies and economic conditions that may affect the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets 
the significant assumptions used to measure periodic benefit cost and pension obligations are described below 
size and characteristics of the employee population periodic benefit cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans and other factors  including salary  age and years of employment 
actuarial assumptions actuarial assumptions used to estimate benefit obligations consider factors such as mortality rate  turnover rate  retirement rate  disability rate and the rate of compensation increases 
these factors tend to change gradually over time 
the aggregate impact of assumptions is reviewed each year and specific assumptions are reviewed periodically 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets we calculate the expected return on plan assets each year based on the composition of assets at the beginning of the plan year and the expected long term rate of return on that portfolio 
the expected long term rate of return is designed to approximate the actual long term rate of return on plan assets over time and is not expected to change significantly 
to determine if the expected rate of return is reasonable  we consider such factors as the actual return earned on plan assets  historical rates of return on the various asset classes in the plan portfolio  projections of returns on various asset classes  and current prospective capital market conditions and economic forecasts 
if we were to assume a basis point increase or decrease in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets for all defined benefit pension plans and keep all other assumptions constant  benefit cost would increase or decrease by approximately million 
discount rate we use the discount rate to determine the present value of our future benefit obligations 
it reflects the rates available on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments  reset annually on the measurement date 
if we were to assume a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate for all defined benefit pension plans and keep all other assumptions constant  benefit cost would increase or decrease by approximately million  and the projected benefit obligation would increase or decrease by approximately million 
additional information about our pension plans and related benefit costs is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item financial condition years ended december  average balance average balance in millions assets interest bearing deposits with banks securities purchased under resale agreements federal funds sold trading account assets investment securities loans total interest earning assets cash and due from banks other assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing deposits us non us total interest bearing deposits securities sold under repurchase agreements federal funds purchased other short term borrowings long term debt total interest bearing liabilities noninterest bearing deposits other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity overview of consolidated statement of condition the structure of our consolidated statement of condition  or balance sheet  is primarily driven by the liabilities generated by our core investment servicing and investment management businesses 
as our customers execute their worldwide cash management and investment activities  they use short term investments and deposits that constitute the majority of our liabilities 
these liabilities are generally in the form of non interest bearing demand deposits  interest bearing transaction account deposits  which are denominated in a variety of currencies  and repurchase agreements  which generally serve as short term investment alternatives for our customers 
our customers needs and our operating objectives determine the volume  mix and currency denomination of our consolidated balance sheet 
deposits and other liabilities generated by customer activities are invested in assets that generally match the liquidity and interest rate characteristics of the liabilities 
as a result  our assets consist primarily of high quality  marketable securities held in our available for sale or held to maturity investment securities portfolio and short term money market instruments  such as inter bank placements  federal funds sold and securities purchased under resale agreements 
the actual mix of assets is determined by the characteristics of the customer liabilities and our desire to maintain a well diversified portfolio of high quality assets 
managing our consolidated balance sheet structure is a disciplined process conducted within specific board approved policies for interest rate risk  credit risk and liquidity 
for  the growth in average interest bearing liabilities of billion was composed of a billion increase in foreign deposits offset by a decline in repurchase agreements of billion 
these changes are representative of the higher levels of customer activity outside the us average interest earning assets in increased billion from  consistent with the increased level of customer liabilities 
during  we substantially completed the investment portfolio restructuring begun in late the average investment portfolio increased billion  offset in part by a decline in average interest bearing deposits with banks of billion 
the composition of the investment portfolio continued to favor mortgage and asset backed securities because of their high credit quality  higher yields and highly liquid nature 
the credit quality of the investment portfolio remained very strong at year end  with of the securities rated aaa and rated aa 
investment securities we consider a well diversified  high credit quality investment securities portfolio to be an important element in the management of our consolidated balance sheet 
the portfolio continues to be concentrated in marketable securities with high credit quality  with approximately of the carrying value of the portfolio aaa or aa rated 
the percentages of the carrying value of the investment securities portfolio by credit rating were as follows as of december aaa aa a bbb non rated includes us treasury securities the investment securities portfolio is also diversified with respect to asset class 
the bulk of the portfolio is in high grade mortgage backed and asset backed securities

net pre tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities at december  were million  or million after tax 
management considers the aggregate decline in fair value and the resulting net unrealized losses to be temporary and primarily the result of increases in interest rates  not the result of any material changes in the credit characteristics of the investment securities portfolio 
management has the ability and the intent to hold the securities until recovery in market value 
we generally configure our investment securities portfolio so that any change in its fair value is largely  but not totally  offset by changes in the economic value of our customer liabilities  however  existing accounting standards do not allow for the change in economic value of our customer liabilities to offset unrealized losses on available for sale securities 
we intend to continue managing our investment securities portfolio to align with interest rate and duration characteristics of our customer liabilities and in the context of our overall balance sheet structure  which is maintained within internally approved risk limits  and in consideration of the global interest rate environment 
even with material changes in unrealized losses on available for sale securities  we may not experience material changes in our interest rate risk profile  or experience a material impact on our net interest revenue 
additional information about these and other unrealized losses is in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item the increase in state and political subdivisions in the available for sale category compared to resulted from the consolidation onto our balance sheet of certain trusts utilized in connection with our tax exempt investment programs

these outstandings consist primarily of deposits with banks  loans and lease financing and investment securities 
in addition to credit risk  cross border outstandings have the risk that  as a result of political or economic conditions in a country  borrowers may be unable to meet their contractual repayment obligations of principal and or interest when due because of the unavailability of  or restrictions on  foreign exchange needed by borrowers to repay their obligations

capital regulatory and economic capital management both use key metrics evaluated by management to ensure that our actual level of capital is commensurate with our risk profile  is in compliance with all regulatory requirements  and is sufficient to provide us with the financial flexibility to undertake future strategic business initiatives 
regulatory capital our objective with respect to regulatory capital management is to maintain a strong capital base in order to provide financial flexibility for our business needs  including funding corporate growth and supporting customers cash management needs  and to provide protection against loss to depositors and creditors 
we strive to maintain an optimal level of capital  commensurate with our risk profile  on which an attractive return to shareholders will be realized over both the short and long term  while protecting our obligations to depositors and creditors and satisfying regulatory requirements 
the capital committee  working in conjunction with the asset and liability committee  or alco  oversees the management of regulatory capital  and is responsible for ensuring capital adequacy with respect to regulatory requirements  internal targets and the expectations of credit rating agencies 
our capital management process focuses on our risk exposures  our capital position relative to our peers  regulatory capital requirements and the evaluations of the major independent credit rating agencies that assign ratings to our public debt 
the primary regulator of both state street and state street bank for capital purposes is the federal reserve board 
both state street and the bank are subject to the minimum capital requirements established by the federal reserve board and defined in the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of  or fdicia 
the bank must meet the regulatory capital thresholds for well capitalized in order for state street to maintain its status as a financial holding company 
regulatory capital ratios and related regulatory guidelines for state street and state street bank were as follows as of december regulatory guidelines state street state street bank minimum well capitalized regulatory capital ratios tier capital total capital tier leverage ratio regulatory guideline for well capitalized applies only to state street bank 
at december   state street s and state street bank s tier and total risk based capital ratios increased compared to year end  the result of growth in capital  primarily from earnings 
total risk weighted assets were flat year over year  as growth in balance sheet risk weighted assets  primarily investment securities available for sale and loans  was offset by a decrease in off balance sheet equivalent risk weighted assets 
the decrease resulted primarily from allowable changes in the calculation of exposure related to our securities finance activities 
both ratios for state street and state street bank exceeded the regulatory minimum and well capitalized thresholds 
to manage fluctuations in the tier and total risk based capital of state street and state street bank resulting from foreign currency translation  we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net foreign investment in non us subsidiaries 
the notional value of these contracts was million  or approximately million  at december  in june  the basel committee on banking supervision released the final version of its capital adequacy framework  known as basel ii 
in  the four us banking regulatory agencies jointly issued their second draft of implementation rules  and are seeking industry comment by the end of march additional supervisory guidance is expected to be available by the end of march  and the release of the final implementation rules is expected prior to the end of under the current implementation plan  state street  along with other large internationally active us institutions  will be required to be fully implemented under the us rules during state street previously established a comprehensive implementation program to ensure these regulatory requirements are met within prescribed timeframes 
at this time  we cannot predict the final form of the rules in the us  nor their impact on state street s or state street bank s risk based capital 
we have increased our quarterly dividend twice each year since over the last ten years  dividends per share have grown at a compound annual growth rate 
funds for cash distributions to our shareholders by the parent company are derived from a variety of sources 
the level of dividends to shareholders on our common stock  which totaled million in  is reviewed regularly and determined by the board considering our liquidity  capital adequacy and recent earnings history and prospects  as well as economic conditions and other factors deemed relevant 
federal and state banking regulations place certain restrictions on dividends paid by subsidiary banks to the parent holding company 
in addition  bank regulators have the authority to prohibit bank holding companies from paying dividends if they deem such payment to be an unsafe or unsound practice 
at december   the parent company had billion of liquid assets with which to meet dividend declaration and other payment obligations 
information concerning dividends from our subsidiary banks is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item during the first quarter of  we purchased million shares of our common stock under a program authorized by our board in on march   the board authorized a new program for the purchase of up to million shares of our common stock for general corporate purposes  including mitigating the dilutive impact of shares issued under employee benefit programs  and terminated the program 
under this new program  we purchased million shares of our common stock during  and as of december   million shares were available for purchase 
we utilize third party broker dealers to acquire common shares on the open market in our execution of the stock purchase program 
additional information about share purchases is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item economic capital we define economic capital as the common equity required to protect debt holders against unexpected economic losses over a one year period at a level consistent with the solvency of a firm with our target aa debt rating 
our entire economic capital process is the responsibility of our capital committee 
the framework and methodologies used to quantify economic capital for each of the risk types described below have been developed by our enterprise risk management  global treasury and finance groups  and are designed to be generally consistent with our risk management principles 
this framework has been approved by senior management and has been reviewed by the executive committee of the board 
due to the evolving nature of quantification techniques  we expect to periodically refine the methodologies used to estimate our economic capital requirements  which could result in a different amount of capital needed to support our risk profile 
we quantify capital requirements for the risks inherent in our business activities and group them into one of the following broadly defined categories market risk the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in market prices  primarily as they relate to our trading activities interest rate risk the risk of loss in non trading asset and liability management positions  primarily the impact of adverse movements in interest rates on the repricing mismatches that exist between balance sheet assets and liabilities credit risk the risk of loss that may result from the default or downgrade of a borrower or counterparty operational risk the risk of loss from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events business risk the risk of adverse changes in our earnings from business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of business activities  and the effect of strategic and reputation risks economic capital for each of these five categories is estimated on a stand alone basis using statistical modeling techniques applied to internally generated and  in some cases  external data 
these individual results are then aggregated at the state street consolidated level 
a capital reduction or diversification benefit is then applied to reflect the unlikely event of experiencing an extremely large loss in each risk type at the same time 
liquidity the objective of liquidity management is to ensure that we have the ability to meet our financial obligations in a timely and cost effective manner  and that we maintain sufficient flexibility to fund strategic corporate initiatives as they arise 
effective management of liquidity involves assessing the potential mismatch between the future cash needs of our customers and our available sources of cash under normal and adverse economic and business conditions 
uses of liquidity consist primarily of meeting deposit withdrawals and funding outstanding commitments to extend credit as they are drawn upon 
liquidity is provided by the maintenance of broad access to the global capital markets and our balance sheet asset structure  as described below 
global treasury is responsible for the day to day management of our global liquidity position  which is conducted within risk guidelines established and monitored by alco 
management maintains a liquidity measurement framework  including a contingency funding plan designed to manage through a potential liquidity crisis 
the plan defines roles  responsibilities  and management actions to be undertaken in the event of deterioration in our liquidity profile caused by either a state street specific event or a broader disruption in the capital markets 
the plan outlines several levels of potential risk to our liquidity and identifies several triggers that we use as early warning signals of a possible difficulty 
these triggers are a combination of internal and external measures of increases in potential cash needs or decreases in available cash sources and possible impairment of our ability to access the global capital markets 
we generally manage our liquidity risk on a global basis at the consolidated level  but we also manage parent company liquidity separately 
state street bank generally has broader access to funding products and markets limited to banks  specifically the federal funds market and the federal reserve s discount window 
the parent company is managed to a more conservative liquidity profile  reflecting narrower market access 
we typically hold enough cash  primarily in the form of interest bearing deposits with subsidiary banks  to meet current debt maturities and cash needs and those projected over the next one year period 
material risks to the sources of short term liquidity would include  among other things  rating agency downgrades of our deposits and debt securities below investment grade level  which would restrict our ability to access the funding markets and may lead to withdrawals of unsecured deposits by our customers 
in addition  a large volume of unanticipated funding requirements  such as fundings under liquidity asset purchase agreements that have met draw conditions  or large draw downs of existing lines of credit  could require additional liquidity 
as of december   there were no circumstances that management considered reasonably likely to occur that would adversely impact our sources of short term liquidity 
while maintenance of our high investment grade credit rating is of primary importance to our liquidity management program  on balance sheet liquid assets represent significant liquidity that we can directly control and provide a source of cash in the form of principal maturities and the ability to borrow from the capital markets using our securities as collateral 
our liquid assets consist primarily of short term money market assets  such as federal funds sold and interest bearing deposits with banks  the latter of which are multicurrency instruments invested with major multinational banks  and high quality  marketable investment securities not already pledged  which generally are more liquid than other types of assets and can be sold or borrowed against to quickly generate cash 
as of december   our liquid assets  as defined  totaled billion 
securities carried at billion as of december  were designated as pledged for public and trust deposits  borrowed funds and for other purposes as provided by law  and are excluded from the liquid assets calculation 
based upon our level of liquid assets and our ability to access the capital markets for additional funding when necessary  management considers overall liquidity at december  more than sufficient to meet state street s current commitments and business needs  including accommodating the transaction and cash management needs of its customers 
our ability to maintain consistent access to liquidity is fostered by the maintenance of high investment grade ratings on our debt  as measured by the major independent credit rating agencies 
factors essential to retaining high credit ratings include diverse and stable core earnings  strong risk management  strong capital ratios  diverse liquidity sources  including the global funds markets and customer deposits  and strong liquidity monitoring procedures 
high ratings on debt minimize borrowing costs and enhance our liquidity by ensuring the largest possible market for our debt 
a downgrade or reduction in credit ratings could have an adverse impact to our ability to access funding at favorable interest rates

the measurement  monitoring and mitigation of risks are essential to the financial performance and successful management of state street s businesses 
these risks  if not effectively managed  can result in current losses to state street as well as erosion of our capital and damage to our reputation 
our systematic approach also allows for a more precise assessment of risks within a framework for evaluating opportunities for the prudent use of capital 
we have a disciplined approach to risk management that involves all levels of management 
the board provides extensive review and oversight of state street s overall risk management programs  including the approval of key risk management policies and the periodic review of state street s key risk indicators 
these indicators are designed to identify major business activities of state street with significant risk content  and to establish quantifiable thresholds for risk measurement 
key risk indicators are reported regularly to the executive committee of the board  and are reviewed periodically for appropriateness 
modifications to the indicators are made to reflect changes in our business activities or refinements to existing measurements 
enterprise risk management  or erm  a dedicated corporate group  provides oversight  support and coordination across business units and is responsible for the formulation and maintenance of enterprise wide risk management policies and guidelines 
in addition  erm establishes and reviews approved limits  and with the support of business line management  monitors key risks 
the head of erm meets regularly with the board or a board committee  as appropriate  and has the authority to escalate issues as necessary 
the execution of duties in the management of people  products  business operations and processes is the responsibility of business unit managers 
the function of risk management is responsible for designing  orchestrating and directing the implementation of risk management programs and processes consistent with corporate and regulatory standards 
accordingly  risk management is a shared responsibility and requires joint efforts in goal setting  program design and implementation  resource management  and performance evaluation between business and functional units 
responsibility for risk management is overseen by a series of management committees 
the major risk committee  or mrc  is responsible for the formulation  recommendation and approval of policies  guidelines and programs governing the identification  analysis  measurement and control of material risks across state street 
chaired by the head of erm  the mrc focuses on the review of business activities with significant risk content and the assessment of risk management programs and initiatives  and also serves as the credit policy committee for state street 
the capital committee  chaired by the chief financial officer  oversees the management of our regulatory and economic capital  the determination of the framework for capital allocation and strategies for capital structure and debt and equity issuances 
alco  chaired by the treasurer  oversees the management of our consolidated balance sheet  including management of our global liquidity and interest rate risk positions 
the fiduciary review committee reviews the criteria for the acceptance of fiduciary duties  and assists our business lines with their fiduciary responsibilities executed on behalf of customers 
several other committees with specialized risk management functions report to the mrc 
corporate audit serves in a complementary role to our program of risk management  providing the board and management with continuous monitoring and control assessments to ensure adherence to state street s policies and procedures and the effectiveness of its system of internal controls 
the group also has responsibility for the independent validation of financial models utilized in our businesses 
additionally  the internal control environment is evaluated through external examinations and regulatory compliance efforts 
the corporate compliance  regulatory and industry affairs  and legal groups also serve essential roles in risk management 
corporate compliance is responsible for the design  implementation and oversight of policies  guidelines and programs to ensure our compliance with applicable laws and regulations wherever state street conducts business 
the regulatory and industry affairs group monitors proposed changes in rules and legislation  and the legal group provides counsel that enables us to deal with complex legal and regulatory environments  maximize business opportunities and minimize legal  regulatory and other risks 
while we believe our risk management program is effective in managing the risks in our businesses  external factors may create risks that cannot always be identified or anticipated 
for example  a material counterparty failure or a default of a material obligor could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
market risk market risk is defined as the risk of adverse financial impact due to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and other market driven rates or prices 
state street is exposed to market risk both in its trading and non trading  or asset and liability management  activities 
state street manages its overall market risk through a comprehensive risk management framework 
this framework includes risk management groups that report independently to senior management through erm 
the process of managing market risk for these activities  discussed in further detail below  applies to both on balance sheet and off balance sheet exposures 
trading activities we primarily engage in trading and investment activities to serve our customers needs and to contribute to overall corporate earnings and liquidity 
in the conduct of these activities  we are subject to  and assume  market risk 
the level of market risk that we assume is a function of our overall objectives and liquidity needs  customer requirements and market volatility 
interest rate risk  a component of market risk  is more thoroughly discussed in the asset and liability management portion of this market risk section 
market risk associated with foreign exchange and trading activities is controlled through established limits on aggregate and net open positions  sensitivity to changes in interest rates  and concentrations  which are supplemented by stop loss limits 
we use an array of risk management tools and methodologies  including value at risk  to measure  monitor and control market risk 
all limits and measurement techniques are reviewed and adjusted as necessary on a regular basis by business managers  the market risk management group and the trading and market risk committee 
we use a variety of derivative financial instruments to support customers needs  conduct trading activities and manage our interest rate and currency risk 
these activities are designed to create trading revenue or hedge volatility in net interest revenue 
in addition  we provide services related to derivative financial instruments in our role as both a manager and servicer of financial assets 
our customers use derivative financial instruments to manage the financial risks associated with their investment goals and business activities 
with the growth of cross border investing  customers have an increasing need for foreign exchange forward contracts to convert currency for international investment and to manage the currency risk in international investment portfolios 
as an active participant in the foreign exchange markets  we provide foreign exchange forward contracts and options in support of these customer needs 
as part of our trading activities  we assume positions in the foreign exchange and interest rate markets by buying and selling cash instruments and using derivative financial instruments  including foreign exchange forward contracts  foreign exchange and interest rate options and interest rate swaps 
as of december   the notional amounts of all of these derivative financial instruments were billion  of which billion were foreign exchange forward contracts 
in the aggregate  long and short foreign exchange forward positions are closely matched to minimize currency and interest rate risk 
all foreign exchange contracts are valued daily at current market rates 
we use a variety of risk measurement and estimation techniques  including value at risk 
value at risk is an estimate of potential loss for a given period within a stated statistical confidence interval 
we use a system of risk management to estimate value at risk daily for all material trading positions 
we have adopted standards for estimating value at risk  and we maintain capital for market risk in accordance with applicable regulatory guidelines 
value at risk is estimated for a one tail confidence interval and an assumed one day holding period using a historical observation period of greater than one year 
a one tail confidence interval implies that daily trading losses should not exceed the estimated value at risk more than of the time  or approximately three days out of the year 
the methodology uses a simulation approach based on observed changes in market prices and takes into account the resulting diversification benefits provided from the mix of our trading positions 
like all quantitative risk measures  value at risk is subject to certain limitations and assumptions inherent in the methodology 
our methodology gives equal weight to all market rate observations regardless of how recently the market rates were observed 
the estimate is calculated using static portfolios consisting of positions held at the end of the trading day 
implicit in the estimate is the assumption that no intraday action is taken by management during adverse market movements 
as a result  the methodology does not represent risk associated with intraday changes in positions or intraday price volatility 
the following table presents our market risk for our trading activities as measured by our value at risk methodology value at risk in millions annual average maximum minimum annual average maximum minimum years ended december  foreign exchange products interest rate products we compare daily profits and losses from trading activities to estimated one day value at risk 
for the years ended december   and  we did not experience any trading losses in excess of our end of day value at risk estimate 
asset and liability management activities the primary objective of asset and liability management is to provide sustainable and growing net interest revenue  or nir  under varying economic environments  while protecting the economic values of our balance sheet assets and liabilities from the adverse effects of changes in interest rates 
most of our nir is earned from the investment of deposits generated by our core investment servicing and investment management businesses 
we structure our balance sheet assets to generally conform to the characteristics of our balance sheet liabilities  but we manage our overall interest rate risk position in the context of current and anticipated market conditions and within internally approved risk guidelines 
our overall interest rate risk position is maintained within a series of policies approved by the board and guidelines established and monitored by alco 
our global treasury unit has responsibility for managing state street s day to day interest rate risk 
to effectively manage the consolidated balance sheet and related net interest revenue  global treasury has the authority to take a limited amount of interest rate risk based on market conditions and its views about the direction of global interest rates over both short term and long term time horizons 
global treasury manages our exposure to changes in interest rates on a consolidated basis  and they have organized themselves into three regional treasury units  north america  europe  and asia pacific  to reflect the growing  global nature of our exposures and to capture the impact of change in regional market environments on our total risk position 
our investment activities and our use of derivative financial instruments are the primary tools used in managing interest rate risk 
we invest in financial instruments with currency  repricing  and maturity characteristics we consider appropriate to manage our overall interest rate risk position 
in addition to on balance sheet assets  we use certain derivatives  primarily interest rate swaps  to alter the interest rate characteristics of specific balance sheet assets or liabilities 
the use of derivatives is subject to alco approved guidelines 
additional information about our use of derivatives is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item as a result of growth in our non us operations  non us dollar denominated customer liabilities are a significant portion of our consolidated balance sheet 
this growth results in exposure to changes in the shape and level of non us dollar yield curves  which we include in our consolidated interest rate risk management process 
because no one individual measure can accurately assess all of our risks to changes in rates  we use several quantitative measures in our assessment of current and potential future exposures to changes in interest rates and their impact on net interest revenue and balance sheet values 
net interest revenue simulation is the primary tool used in our evaluation of the potential range of possible net interest revenue results that could occur under a variety of interest rate environments 
we also use market valuation and duration analysis to assess changes in the economic value of balance sheet assets and liabilities caused by assumed changes in interest rates 
finally  gap analysis the difference between the amount of balance sheet assets and liabilities re pricing within a specified time period is used as a measurement of our interest rate risk position 
to measure  monitor  and report on our interest rate risk position  we use nir simulation  or nir at risk  which measures the impact on nir over the next twelve months to immediate  or rate shock  and gradual  or rate ramp  changes in market interest rates  and economic value of equity  or eve  which measures the impact on the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows of an immediate change in interest rates 
nir at risk is designed to measure the potential impact of changes in market interest rates on net interest revenue in the short term 
eve  on the other hand  is a long term view of interest rate risk  but with a view toward liquidation of state street 
both of these measures are subject to alco established guidelines  and are monitored regularly  along with other relevant simulations  scenario analyses and stress tests by both global treasury and alco 
in calculating our nir at risk  we start with a base amount of net interest revenue that is projected over the next twelve months  assuming that the then current yield curve remains unchanged over the period 
our existing balance sheet assets and liabilities are adjusted by the amount and timing of transactions that are forecasted to occur over the next twelve months 
that yield curve is then shocked  or moved immediately  basis points in a parallel fashion  or at all points along the yield curve 
two new twelve month nir projections are then developed using the same balance sheet and forecasted transactions  but with the new yield curves  and compared to the base scenario 
we also perform the calculations using interest rate ramps  which are basis point changes in interest rates that are assumed to occur gradually over the next twelve month period  rather than immediately as we do with interest rate shocks 
eve is based on the change in the present value of all nir related principal and interest cash flows for changes in market rates of interest 
the present value of existing cash flows with a then current yield curve serves as the base case 
we then apply an immediate parallel shock to that yield curve of basis points and recalculate the cash flows and related present values 
a large shock is used to better capture the embedded option risk in our mortgage backed securities that results from the borrower s prepayment opportunity 
key assumptions used in the models described above include the timing of cash flows  the maturity and repricing of balance sheet assets and liabilities  especially option embedded financial instruments like mortgage backed securities  changes in market conditions  and interest rate sensitivities of our customer liabilities with respect to the interest rates paid and the level of balances 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the models cannot precisely calculate future nir or predict the impact of changes in interest rates on nir and economic value 
actual results could differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and market conditions  changes in spreads and management strategies  among other factors 
projections of potential future streams of nir are assessed as part of our forecasting process 
the following table presents the estimated exposure of nir for the next twelve months  calculated as of december  and  due to an immediate basis point shift in then current interest rates 
estimated incremental exposures presented below are dependent on management s assumptions about asset and liability sensitivities under various interest rate scenarios  such as those previously discussed  and do not reflect any actions management may undertake in order to mitigate some of the adverse effects of interest rate changes on state street s financial performance 
nir at risk estimated exposure to net interest revenue in millions rate change bps shock bps shock bps ramp bps ramp the following table presents estimated eve exposures  calculated as of december  and  assuming an immediate and prolonged shift in interest rates  the impact of which would be spread over a number of years 
economic value of equity estimated exposure to economic value of equity in millions rate change bps shock bps shock while the measures presented in the tables above are not a prediction of future nir or valuations  they do suggest that if all other variables remained constant  in the short term  falling interest rates would lead to nir that is higher than it would otherwise have been  and rising rates would lead to lower nir 
other important factors that impact the levels of nir are balance sheet size and mix  interest rate spreads  the slope and interest rate level of us dollar and us dollar yield curves and the relationship between them  the pace of change in market interest rates  and management actions taken in response to the preceding conditions 
incremental increases in the levels of nir at risk and eve exposures for upward shifts in interest rates presented in the tables above are largely the result of the increased purchases of fixed rate securities  primarily securities available for sale  in response to management s expectations concerning the future direction of us interest rates 
these purchases resulted in an overall interest rate risk position that was well within internally approved guidelines 
the securities were purchased in accordance with management s intention to maintain the high credit quality of our investment portfolio 
one of the most significant assumptions underlying our modeling methodologies and the level of our nir is the reaction of our balance sheet liabilities  such as deposits  to movements in market interest rates 
generally  we invest customer deposits in money market assets and high quality investment securities  the mix of which is determined by the interest rate and balance sensitivities of customer deposits under a variety of economic environments 
we regularly assess the characteristics of customer liabilities by product  geography  currency and customer type to ensure that the characteristics have not materially changed in a way that would create material risk to our nir and net interest margin 
credit risk credit and counterparty risk is defined as the risk of financial loss if a borrower or counterparty is either unable or unwilling to repay borrowings or settle in accordance with contractual terms 
the extension of credit and acceptance of counterparty risk by state street are governed by corporate guidelines based on the prospective customer s risk profile  the markets served  counterparty and country concentrations  and regulatory compliance 
our focus on large institutional investors and their businesses requires that we assume concentrated credit risk in a variety of forms to certain highly rated entities 
this concentration risk is mitigated by comprehensive guidelines and procedures to monitor and manage all aspects of credit and counterparty risk that we undertake 
exposures are evaluated on an individual basis at least annually 
we provide  on a limited basis  traditional loan products and services to key customers and prospects in a manner that enhances customer relationships  increases profitability and minimizes risk 
we employ a relationship model in which credit decisions are based upon credit quality and the overall institutional relationship 
this model is typical of financial institutions that provide credit to institutional customers in the markets that we serve 
an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb probable credit losses in the loan portfolio and is reviewed regularly by management for adequacy 
an internal rating system is used to assess potential risk of loss based on customer investment profile  current economic and or customer financial indicators 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings to maintain the overall allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate relative to the level of credit risk in the loan and lease financing portfolio 
no provision was recorded in either or in  we reversed million through the provision as a result of reduced credit risk exposures and improved credit quality 
at december  and  the allowance for loan losses was million  less than of total loans as of each year end 
changes in the allowance for loan losses were as follows for the years ended december in millions us balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses loan charge offs commercial and financial recoveries commercial and financial transferred upon sale reclassification balance at end of year us non us balance at beginning of year provision for loan losses reclassification balance at end of year non us total balance at end of year in  we completed the sale of our global trade banking business  which included the transfer of million of the allowance for loan losses 
in  we reclassified million of the allowance for loan losses to other liabilities as a reserve for off balance sheet commitments 
subsequent to the reclassification  the reserve for off balance sheet commitments was reduced by million  and recorded as an offset to other operating expenses 
past due loans are loans on which principal or interest payments are over days delinquent  but where interest continues to be accrued 
there were no past due loans as of december     and we generally place loans on non accrual status once payments are days past due  or earlier if management determines that full collection is not probable 
loans days past due  but considered both well secured and in the process of collection  may be excluded from non accrual status 
for loans placed on non accrual status  revenue recognition is suspended 
there were no non accrual loans at year end    and we purchase securities under agreements to resell 
risk is minimized by establishing the acceptability of counterparties  limiting purchases almost exclusively to low risk us government securities  taking possession or control of transaction assets  monitoring levels of underlying collateral  and limiting the duration of the agreements 
securities are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary from the borrower 
most repurchase agreements are short term  with maturities of less than days 
we also provide customers with off balance sheet liquidity and credit enhancement facilities in the form of letters of credit  lines of credit and liquidity asset purchase agreements 
these exposures are subject to an initial credit analysis  with detailed approval and review processes 
these facilities are also actively monitored and reviewed on an annual basis 
we maintain a separate reserve for probable credit losses related to certain of these off balance sheet activities 
management reviews the adequacy of this reserve on a regular basis 
on behalf of our customers  we lend their securities to creditworthy banks  broker dealers and other institutions 
in most circumstances  we indemnify our customers for the fair market value of those securities against a failure of the borrower to return such securities 
though these transactions are well collateralized  the substantial volume of these activities necessitates thorough credit based underwriting and monitoring processes 
state street requires the borrowers to provide collateral in an amount equal to or in excess of of the fair market value of the securities borrowed 
collateral funds received in connection with our securities lending services are held by us as agent and are not recorded in our consolidated statement of condition 
the borrowed securities and collateral are revalued daily to determine if additional collateral is necessary 
state street held  as agent  cash and securities totaling billion and billion as collateral for indemnified securities financing at december  and  respectively 
processes for credit approval and monitoring are in place for other credit extensions 
as part of the approval and renewal process  appropriate due diligence is conducted based on the size and term of the exposure  as well as the quality of the counterparty 
exposures to these entities are aggregated and evaluated by erm 
investments in debt and equity securities  including investments in affiliates  are monitored regularly by corporate finance and erm 
to the extent necessary  procedures are in place for evaluating potentially impaired securities 
total non performing investment securities were million at both december  and operational risk we define operational risk as the potential for loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  and from external events 
as a leading provider of services to institutional investors  our customers have a broad array of complex and specialized servicing  confidentiality and fiduciary requirements 
active management of operational risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business  and responsibility for the management of operational risk lies with every individual at state street 
our operational risk policy statement defines operational risk and details roles and responsibilities for managing operational risk 
the policy statement is reinforced by the operational risk guidelines  which codify our approach to operational risk 
the guidelines document our sound practices and provide a mandate within which programs  processes  and regulatory elements are implemented to ensure that operational risk is identified  measured  managed and controlled in an effective and consistent manner across state street 
we maintain an operational risk governance structure to ensure that responsibilities are clearly defined and to provide independent oversight of operational risk management 
business units periodically review the status of the business controls and monitor and report key risk indicator results 
erm oversees the overall operational risk management program 
the mrc and the operational risk committee review key risk indicators and policies related to operational risk  provide oversight to ensure compliance with the operational risk program  and escalate operational risk issues of note to the executive committee of the board 
corporate audit performs independent reviews of the application of operational risk management practices and methodologies and reports to the examining and audit committee of the board 
state street s internal control environment is designed to provide a sound operational environment 
our discipline in managing operational risk provides the structure to identify  evaluate  control  monitor  measure  mitigate and report operational risk 
business risk we define business risk as the risk of adverse changes in our earnings related to business factors  including changes in the competitive environment  changes in the operational economics of business activities and the potential effect of strategic and reputation risks  not already captured as market  credit or operational risks 
we incorporate business risk into our assessment of our economic capital needs 
active management of business risk is an integral component of all aspects of our business  and responsibility for the management of business risk lies with every individual at state street 
it is sometimes difficult to separate the effects of a potential adverse event into operational and business risks 
for instance  the direct financial impact of an unfavorable event in the form of fines or penalties would be classified as an operational risk loss  while the impact on our reputation and the potential loss of customers and corresponding decline in revenue would be classified as a business risk loss 
an additional example of business risk is the integration of a major acquisition 
failure to successfully integrate the operations of an acquired business  and the resultant inability to retain customers  would be classified as a business risk loss 
business risk is managed with a long term focus 
techniques include the careful development of business plans and appropriate management oversight 
the potential impact of the various elements of business risk is difficult to quantify with any degree of precision 
we use a combination of historical earnings volatility  scenario analysis  stress testing and management judgment to help assess the potential effect on state street attributable to business risk 
management and control of business risks are generally the responsibility of the business units as part of their overall and strategic planning and internal risk management processes 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  we hold assets under custody and assets under management in a custodial or fiduciary capacity for our customers  and  in accordance with gaap  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
similarly  collateral funds resulting from our securities finance activities are held by us as agent  therefore  we do not record these assets in our consolidated statement of condition 
additional information about these activities is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item in the normal course of business  we sell and distribute securities for three types of off balance sheet entities  two of which are not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about these special purpose entities is in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item the risks associated with providing administration  liquidity  and or credit enhancements to these special purpose entities are reviewed as part of our corporate risk management process in a manner that is consistent with applicable policies and guidelines 
we believe that state street has sufficient liquidity and has provided adequate credit reserves to cover any risks associated with these activities 
in the normal course of business  we utilize derivative financial instruments to support our customers needs  to conduct trading activities and to manage our interest rate and foreign currency risk 
additional information about our use of derivatives is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item recent accounting developments in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
this new standard is intended to make it easier for financial statement users to understand an employer s financial position and ability to meet the obligations of its benefit plans 
the standard requires recognition in our consolidated statement of condition of the overfunded or underfunded status of our tax qualified defined benefit pension plan  nonqualified retirement plans and postretirement benefit plans  which is the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the related benefit obligations 
the standard also requires the reclassification of the after tax amount of any unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service costs to accumulated other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity 
in subsequent years  the after tax amount of changes in unrecognized actuarial gains and losses  as well as unrecognized prior service costs  will be recorded in other comprehensive income 
the standard was effective on december  with respect to the recognition of our plans funded status  and the standard s remaining provisions must be applied prospectively 
upon adoption of the standard  to recognize the after tax difference between our plans net funded status and the amounts currently recorded in the consolidated statement of condition  we recorded an after tax reduction of accumulated other comprehensive income of approximately million 
disclosures required by the new standard are included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item in july  the fasb issued fasb staff position  or fsp  no 
fas  accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction 
the fsp  which must be applied as of january   requires that the recognition of lease income over the term of a lease be recalculated if there is a change in the expected timing of tax related cash flows 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of the fsp must be recorded as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings as of january  our application of the fsp s provisions to certain of our leveraged leases resulted in an after tax reduction of the beginning balance of retained earnings on january  of approximately million 
future revenue from the affected leases is expected to increase over the remaining terms of the affected leases by an amount approximately equal to the after tax reduction 
future developments concerning our resolution of issues with the irs with respect to the affected leases could affect management s estimate of the timing of tax related cash flows used to record the cumulative effect adjustment 
changes in estimates of the timing of these tax related cash flows could result in income tax expense in our consolidated statement of income during or later years 
information related to other recent accounting developments is in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k under item to our shareholders was a very good year for state street 
we exceeded all of our financial goals excluding tax adjustments  grew our business globally  expanded relationships with our customers  launched new products  acquired new capabilities and continued to be a strong corporate citizen in the communities in which we live and work 
our performance in was driven by a number of themes that i define as setting the standard for our industry 
consistency the first theme is consistency  which is best illustrated by our financial performance 
was our twenty ninth consecutive year of operating earnings per share growth and our twenty eighth consecutive year of dividend increases  with an percent increase from we outperformed our peer group in revenue and eps growth while generating lower expense growth 
earnings per share from continuing operations  excluding the tax adjustments recorded in the second and fourth quarters  rose percent from exceeding our goal of between and percent  our top line operating revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis was up percent from exceeding our goal of between and percent  and our return on equity from continuing operations  excluding the above mentioned tax adjustments  improved from percent in to percent exceeding our range of between and percent 
we also achieved basis points of positive operating leverage in compared to  and generated four more quarters of year over year operating leverage  bringing state street s number of consecutive quarters of year over year positive operating leverage to nine 
this consistent performance was rewarded with a percent increase in our stock price in we increased net interest revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis by percent over and improved net interest margin to percent  up from percent in we also repurchased million shares of our common stock 
state street global advisors ssga  our investment management arm and the largest institutional asset manager in the world  contributed to our strong financial performance with another outstanding year in  accounting for percent of the company s total pretax profit in  up from percent in pretax profit at ssga increased percent compared to  with its pretax margin up to percent from percent in assets under management grew percent in to trillion 
consistency is also reflected in our approach to community support  sustainable development and the environment 
since  we have contributed a portion of pretax profits to the state street foundation  which in turn provided more than million in grants in to support affordable housing  education and health 
additionally  our employees worldwide devoted  hours to volunteer activities 
in our home state of massachusetts  we were the largest corporate contributor to the united way of massachusetts bay for the sixteenth consecutive year 
this consistent performance on behalf of our communities was a key factor in state street being named to business ethics magazine s best corporate citizens list for state street was also selected for both the world and north america dow jones sustainability indexes  based on our enhanced environmental management and corporate governance policies  in addition to our strong citizenship and philanthropy programs 
based on assets under management global growth the second theme underpinning our strong performance in is global growth 
we made considerable progress in against our long term goal of growing non us revenue to percent  achieving a total of percent in  up from percent in this increase in non us revenue highlights our ability to capitalize on key growth areas  such as hedge and offshore fund servicing  enhanced and active strategies  investment manager operations outsourcing and electronic foreign exchange trading 
at ssga  percent of revenue now comes from non us sources  up from percent in global not only applies to our business but also to our people 
today  approximately percent of our employees are located outside of the us  which provides us with a strong foundation for future growth as we seek to outpace our competitors in markets that are growing faster than the us 
this diversity starts at the top of our company  highlighted by the election in december of three european nationals to our board of directors peter coym  amelia fawcett and maureen miskovic  all of whom bring a wealth of global and financial industry experience to our board 
global also describes our customer base in  with key asset servicing and asset management business wins being awarded to us in beijing  boston  edinburgh  hong kong  london  luxembourg  munich  new york  paris  singapore  sydney  tokyo and toronto 
these wins represent a total of new investment servicing wins and  new asset management business wins from companies that include virgin money  bayerische versorgungskammer  cimb group  ikano fund management sa  tower australia limited and john hancock funds 
innovation the third theme  innovation  remains a key driver in fueling our growth and deepening our relationships with customers 
this focus on innovation is supported by our commitment to investing in technology percent of our operating expenses in and pioneering new products and solutions 
in  we launched a number of industry firsts 
this innovation ranges from the launch of our sovereign bond flow indicator that measures investor flows into sovereign bonds covering countries  to the expansion of our alternative investment strategies capabilities with a new line up of cutting edge absolute return strategies  to new exchange traded funds providing investors with precise exposure to targeted sectors such as the oil and gas sector and the metals and mining sector 
our leading position in investment manager operations outsourcing  a capability that we pioneered in the industry in  continued to expand in with the completion of the first european customer migration onto our enterprise technology and the addition of two new north american customers evergreen investments and putnam investments 
customer focus the fourth and final theme is customer focus 
our commitment to delivering a value to our customers that they cannot find anywhere else proved to be a strong differentiator for state street in  with more than percent of our new revenue coming from deepening relationships with existing customers 
for example  axa investment managers expanded its relationship with us to include servicing for its luxembourg and dublin based fund groups for more than billion in assets 
calamos investments  a customer since  chose state street to provide fund accounting services for an additional nine open ended mutual funds and one variable insurance fund representing billion in assets 
the california public employees retirement system calpers reappointed state street to provide investment services for its billion pension fund  a testament to the high quality customer service that state street has provided to calpers for more than years 
calpers also selected ssga as one of its first managers to implement a domestic long short equity strategy  underscoring the success ssga continues to achieve in offering the most innovative investment strategies available in the industry today 
our ability to deliver for our customers continued to yield business from new customers as well 
for example  ssga was selected by china s national council for social security fund ncssf as external manager for the national social security fund s global equity mandate the first time the ncssf chose a global manager 
customer focus is part of our corporate culture at state street and a value that is reflected across our leadership team 
three members of this team were promoted to vice chairman in  in recognition of the considerable contributions they have made to the evolution of our company and the impact of their responsibilities on our current and future growth 
joseph l 
jay hooley  a year veteran of state street  is head of global investment servicing and investment research and trading 
under his leadership  state street has achieved consistently high growth and has expanded its global presence 
today  the company is the no 
provider of investment manager operations outsourcing services  a leading provider of hedge fund servicing and a world leader in multi asset class trading and transition management 
william w 
hunt is president and chief executive officer of ssga and a year state street veteran 
with more than a decade of experience working outside of the us  hunt plays a key role in driving state street s global expansion as well as accelerating ssga s push into active and enhanced strategies 
joseph c 
antonellis  a year veteran of state street  is chief information officer and heads the company s global securities services  operations and technology 
antonellis  named best cio by the american financial technology awards  is also responsible for the company s investment servicing business in north america 
what s next looking ahead to  the question that i am most often asked is what s next this is a question that we continually ask ourselves to ensure that we don t become complacent and falsely assume that by simply doing more of the same we will deliver similar results 
while we have confidence in our strategic focus  we will continue to evolve our business to ensure that we retain our leadership position in the industry and set the standard for others to follow 
we will also continue to balance revenue growth with expense discipline to generate positive operating leverage  and aggressively pursue capabilities that will augment our market share in high growth markets and will increase our revenue 
our proposed acquisitions of investors financial services corporation and currenex  which we announced at the beginning of  are examples of actions we are taking to enhance our leadership position 
with the acquisition of boston based investors financial services  state street strengthens its position as a worldwide service provider of fund accounting to the mutual fund industry  enhances its capabilities in servicing the offshore fund market  and further extends its leadership in the fastest growing segment of the asset servicing business hedge fund administration 
key to this transaction is the tremendous cross sell opportunities that it provides state street 
investors financial services serves of the top global investment managers 
these institutions will now have access to state street s global capabilities  from foreign exchange to securities lending to servicing cross border assets 
the investors financial services acquisition also expands state street s product line  bringing private equity fund servicing capabilities along with approximately billion in private equity fund assets under administration and strengthens state street s leadership position in key areas 
with the addition of investors financial services trillion in assets under custody  state street will have more than trillion in assets under custody 
state street will also be the no 
administrator of hedge funds  with assets under administration of more than billion 
in addition  the acquisition helps extend state street s lead in investment manager operations outsourcing 
the combination of expanded market share in key growth markets  cross sell opportunities with new customers and the addition of new products will help us generate significant new revenue 
the investors financial services acquisition also complements our acquisition of the currenex foreign exchange trading platform  which accelerates our participation in the electronic foreign exchange trading market and its fastest growing segment hedge funds 
foreign exchange is the largest and most liquid market in the world  with trading volumes of approximately trillion per day 
with the currenex acquisition  state street can offer its customers more efficient access to markets as well as the industry s most flexible  comprehensive trading solutions 
setting the industry standard when we talk about setting the industry standard  we define this standard as delivering financial results that are better than the market and our peer group 
our long term financial goals remain the same as i previously described 
due to the investors financial services corp 
acquisition  however  we have set financial goals for of achieving growth in operating earnings per share of to percent  growth in operating revenue of to percent and return on equity of between and percent 
we expect to achieve near the middle of these ranges in our operating results for will exclude merger  integration and restructuring charges related to the investors financial services acquisition  and for will exclude the previously mentioned tax adjustments 
we expect that further improvements in net interest revenue and net interest margin resulting from the actions we have taken over the past two years will improve the yields from our balance sheet  without adding any significant new credit risk 
by setting the standard for our industry  we will continue to deliver superior results for shareholders  customers  employees and the community 
we are committed to ensuring that we consistently achieve this level of performance across the globe  while continually innovating to create products and services that deepen our relationships with our customers 
we delivered on our commitment in  and i will ensure that we remain equally committed to superior results for all of our stakeholders in sincerely  s ronald e
