table of contents sell end to end networking architecture platform solutions  including products and services  in most major markets globally through a combination of direct and indirect channels 
we also offer component products  such as central processor unit cpu chips and embedded boards  on an oem basis to other hardware manufacturers and supply after market and peripheral products to their end user installed base  both directly and through independent distributors and value added resellers vars 
we have organized our sales coverage within geographically established markets gems around the world 
we employ independent distributors in over countries 
in general  our sales coverage model calls for independent distributors to be deployed via strategic alliances with our direct sales force 
however  in some smaller markets  independent distributors and sun plus partners may be our sole means of sales  marketing and distribution 
our relationships with channel partners are very important to our future revenues and profitability 
channel relationships accounted for more than  and of our total net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
our partner community is essential to our success 
while our product and service offerings are very broad  we recognize that no single supplier of computing solutions can meet all of the needs of all of our customers 
we have established relationships with leading independent software vendors isvs  vars  oems  channel development providers  independent distributors  computer systems integrators and service development providers sdps to deliver solutions that our customers demand 
through these relationships  our goal is to optimize our ability to be the technology of choice  the platform of choice  the partner of choice and to provide the end to end solutions that customers require to compete 
our worldwide marketing organization oversees our marketing planning  determines product and pricing strategy  coordinates advertising  demand creation and public relations activities  maintains strategic alliances with major isvs and performs competitive analyses 
additionally  isvs help us maximize our technology footprint by integrating their software products with our platforms and technologies 
sdps  such as internet service providers isps and application service providers asps  allow us to expand our service coverage without new large scale investments 
we seek out companies to be our partners who align with our technology direction and our vision of enabling network participation 
we partner with advanced micro devices  inc amd to expand our entry level line of opteron processor based x systems

we also maintain a strategic alliance with fujitsu to deliver and support a generation of sparc based systems that we developed through collaboration 
our relationship with fujitsu is discussed in greater detail in item a  risk factors 
this alliance is intended to enlarge the solaris operating system footprint  drive increased market share for our enterprise class systems and allow us to dedicate additional resources to our throughput computing initiative and our next generation of processor products 
we also maintain a relationship with hitachi data systems hds to provide high end storage solutions and extend our storage offerings into other enterprise environments 
revenues from outside the united states us were approximately  and of our total net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
direct sales we make outside of the us are generally priced in local currencies and can be subject to currency exchange fluctuations 
the net foreign currency impact on our total net revenues and operating results is difficult to precisely measure 
however  because of the general weakening of the us dollar  our best estimate of the foreign exchange benefit approximated of total net revenues for fiscal the countries primarily contributing to our international sales are the united kingdom uk  germany and japan 
the uk represented approximately  and of our total net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
germany represented approximately  and of our total net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
japan represented approximately  and of our total net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
for further financial information on sales outside the us  see net revenues by geographic area in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
for a discussion of risks attendant to our foreign operations  see risk factors our international customers and operations subject us to a number of risks  in item a 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item for additional information concerning sales to international customers and business segments 
although our sales and other operating results can be influenced by a number of factors  and historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results  our sequential quarterly operating results generally fluctuate downward in the first and third quarters of each fiscal year when compared with the immediately preceding quarter 
in january  access distribution  the largest distributor of our products  was sold to avnet  inc by general electric company 
avnet  which was storagetek s largest distributor  became a distributor of sun products after our acquisition of storagetek in august sales to avnet and access distribution accounted for approximately   and of net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
no other customer accounted for more than of our net revenues 
accounts receivable from avnet and access distribution and its subsidiaries in the aggregate was approximately and of total accounts receivable as of june  and  respectively 

table of contents our product order backlog at june  was billion  as compared with billion at june  our product backlog includes orders for which customer requested delivery is scheduled within six months and orders that have been specified by the customer for which products have been shipped but revenue has been deferred 
although actual customer delivery can occur over several periods  product backlog can be used to identify potential revenue coverage for future periods 
the larger the percentage coverage of targeted pending revenue  the lower the potential risk of non achievement 
backlog levels vary with demand  product availability  product revenue recognition treatment  and our delivery lead times and are subject to significant decreases as a result of  among other things  customer order delays  changes or cancellations 
as such  backlog levels may not be a reliable indicator of future operating results 
worldwide operations our worldwide operations organization manages company wide purchasing of materials used in making our products  assists in product design enhancements  oversees our manufacturing operations and those of our manufacturing partners and coordinates logistics operations 
our manufacturing operations consist primarily of final assembly  test and quality control of enterprise and data center servers and storage systems 
for all other systems  we rely on external manufacturing partners 
we manufacture primarily in oregon and scotland and distribute much of our hardware products from our facilities and our partner facilities located in california  the netherlands and japan 
we are expanding our direct ship capabilities  using a customer fulfillment architecture that enables us to ship certain products directly from our suppliers to our customers  with the goal of reducing cost  risk and complexity in the supply chain 
we have continued to simplify the manufacturing process by increasing the standardization of components across product types 
in addition  we have continued to increase our focus on quality and processes that are intended to proactively identify and solve quality issues 
the early identification of products containing defects in engineering  design and manufacturing processes  as well as defects in third party components included in our products  could prevent or reduce delays of product shipments 
research and development our research and product development programs are intended to sustain and enhance our competitive position by incorporating the latest advances in hardware  microprocessors  software  graphics  networking  data communications and storage technologies 
in addition  we have extended our product offerings and intellectual property through acquisitions of businesses or technologies or other arrangements with our partners 
our product development continues to focus on enhancing the performance  scalability  reliability  availability and serviceability of our existing systems and the development of new technology standards 
additionally  we remain focused on developing system software platforms for internet and intranet applications  telecommunications and next generation service provider networks  advanced workstation  server and storage architectures and advanced service offerings 
we devote substantial resources to research and development as we believe it provides and will continue to provide significant competitive differentiation 
we conduct research and development principally in the us  us  france  ireland  germany  japan  china  russia  czech republic and india 
research and development expenses were billion  billion  and billion in fiscal  and  respectively 
competition we compete in the computer systems hardware and software  storage hardware and software and services markets 
these markets are intensely competitive 
our competitors are some of the largest  most successful companies in the world 
they include international business machines corporation ibm  dell  inc dell  hewlett packard company hp  emc corporation emc  fujitsu limited fujitsu  hds and the fujitsu siemens joint venture 
we also compete with i systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on microprocessors manufactured by intel  the windows family of operating systems software from microsoft and the linux family of operating systems from red hat and others  as well as ii companies that focus on providing support and maintenance services for computer systems and storage products 
we continue to invest significantly in research and development  billion in fiscal  to create hardware  software and services based on open standards and innovative business models to offer differentiated solutions to our customer  partner and developer communities 
we focus our r d investments to address complex customer issues such as escalating it infrastructure costs  data security  under utilized it assets and the rising costs of power consumption  cooling and space in data centers 
we believe our innovations will continue to help businesses and developers address these it concerns  drive high growth business solutions and differentiate us from our major competitors 

table of contents we believe competition will be at least as intense in the next fiscal year as it was over the last fiscal year 
in this environment  the lack of competitive advantage with respect to our hardware  software or services offerings could lead to a loss of competitive position resulting in fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  reduced margins  reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share 
for more information about the competitive risks we face  refer to item a 
risk factors 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competition  the loss of competitive position could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced revenue  reduced margins  reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share 
patents  trademarks and intellectual property licenses we have used  registered or applied to register certain trademarks and service marks to distinguish our products  technologies and services from those of our competitors in the us and in foreign countries and jurisdictions 
we enforce our trademark  service mark and trade name rights in the us and abroad 
we hold a number of us and foreign patents relating to various aspects of our products and technology 
while we believe that patent protection is important  we believe that factors such as innovative skills and technological expertise provide even greater competitive differentiation 
from time to time we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
such notices are in various stages of evaluation  and some have resulted in current litigation 
we are evaluating the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these matters 
based on industry practice  we believe that any necessary licenses or other rights could be obtained on commercially reasonable terms 
however  no assurance can be given that licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights  or the adverse resolution of litigation arising out of such claims  could adversely affect our business

risk factors if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  the loss of our competitive position could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  reduced margins  reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share 
we compete in the computer systems hardware and software and storage hardware and software products and services markets 
these markets are intensely competitive 
if we fail to compete successfully in these markets  the demand for our products and services would decrease 
any reduction in demand could lead to fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  pricing pressures  reduced margins  reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share 
these competitive pressures could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results 
our competitors are some of the largest  most successful companies in the world 
they include ibm  dell  hp  emc  fujitsu  hds  the fujitsu siemens joint venture  microsoft and intel 
we compete with i systems manufacturers and resellers of systems based on microprocessors from intel  the windows family of operating systems software from microsoft and the linux family of operating systems software from red hat and others  as well as ii companies that focus on providing support and maintenance services for computer systems and storage products 
certain of these competitors compete aggressively on price and seek to maintain very low cost structures 
some of these competitors are seeking to increase their market share  which creates increased pressure  including pricing pressure  on our product lines and service offerings 
in particular  we are seeing increased competition and pricing pressures from competitors offering systems running linux software and other open source software  as well as competitors offering support services 
in addition  certain of our competitors  including ibm and hp  have financial and human resources that are substantially greater than ours  which increases the competitive pressures we face 
these competitors also have significant installed bases  and it can be very difficult to win a new customer that has made significant investments in a competitor s platform 
customers make buying decisions based on many factors  including among other things  new product and service offerings and features  product performance and quality  availability and quality of support and other services  price  platform  interoperability with hardware and software of other vendors  quality  reliability  security features and availability of products  breadth of product line  ease of doing business  a vendor s ability to adapt to customers changing requirements  responsiveness to shifts in the marketplace  business model eg  utility computing  subscription based software usage  consolidation versus outsourcing  contractual terms and conditions  vendor reputation and vendor viability 
as competition increases  each factor on which we compete becomes more important and the lack of competitive advantage with respect to one or more of these factors could lead to a loss of competitive position  resulting in fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  reduced margins  reduced levels of profitability and loss of market share 
we expect competitive pressure to remain intense 
fujitsu and its subsidiaries have  for many years  been key strategic channel partners for sun  distributing substantial quantities of our products throughout the world 
we entered into a number of agreements with fujitsu intended to substantially increase the scope of our relationship with them  including through collaborative selling efforts and joint development and marketing of server products known as the advanced product line apl 
the first group of apl server products was released in april and branded as the sparc enterprise line of servers 
however  fujitsu is also a competitor of sun and  as a licensee of various technologies from sun and others  it has developed products that currently compete directly with our products 
over the last several years  we have invested significantly in our storage products business  including through the acquisition of storagetek  with a view to increasing the sales of these products both on a stand alone basis to customers using the systems of our competitors  and as part of the systems that we sell 
the storage products business is intensely competitive 
emc is currently a leader in the storage products market and our primary competitor 
we are continuing the implementation of a solution based selling approach 
while we believe that strategy will enable us to increase our revenues and margins  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this approach 
in fact  our implementation of this selling model may result in reductions in our revenues and or margins  particularly in the short term  as we compete to attract business 
in addition  if our emphasis on solution based sales increases  we face strong competition from systems integrators such as ibm  fujitsu siemens and hp 
our inability to successfully implement this model would have a material adverse impact on our revenues and margins 
we maintain higher research and development costs  as a percentage of total net revenues  than many of our competitors and our earnings are dependent upon maintaining revenues and gross margins at a sufficient level to offset these costs 
one of our business strategies is to derive a competitive advantage and a resulting enhancement of our gross margins from our investment in innovative new technologies which customers value 
as a result  as a percentage of total net revenues  we incur 
table of contents higher fixed r d costs than many of our competitors 
to the extent that we are unable to develop and sell products with attractive gross margins in sufficient volumes  our earnings may be materially and adversely affected by our cost structure 
we continue to add new products to our entry level server product line that are offered at a lower price point and that may provide us with a lower gross margin percentage than our products as a whole 
although our strategy is to sell these products as part of overall systems that include other products with higher gross margin percentages  to the extent that the mix of our overall revenues represented by sales of lower gross margin products increases  our gross margins and earnings may be materially and adversely affected 
the products we make are very complex 
if we are unable to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new products and manage our inventory  we will not be able to satisfy customer demand 
we operate in a highly competitive  quickly changing environment  and our future success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products that our customers choose to buy 
if we are unable to develop new products  our business and operating results could be adversely affected 
we must quickly develop  introduce  and deliver in quantity new  complex systems  software  and hardware products and components 
these include products that incorporate certain ultrasparc microprocessors and the solaris operating system  the java platform  sun java system portfolio and sun n grid architecture  among others 
the development process for these complicated products is very uncertain 
it requires high levels of innovation from both our product designers and the suppliers of the components used in our products 
the development process is also lengthy and costly 
if we fail to accurately anticipate our customers needs and technological trends  or are otherwise unable to complete the development of a product on a timely basis  we will be unable to introduce new products into the market on a timely basis  if at all  and our business and operating results would be materially and adversely affected 
the manufacture and introduction of our new products is also a complicated process 
once we have developed a new product  we face several challenges in the manufacturing process 
we must be able to manufacture new products in sufficient volumes so that we can have an adequate supply of new products to meet customer demand 
we must also be able to manufacture the new products at acceptable costs 
this requires us to be able to accurately forecast customer demand so that we can procure the appropriate components at optimal costs 
forecasting demand requires us to predict order volumes  the correct mix of our products  and the correct configurations of these products 
we must manage new product introductions and transitions to minimize the impact of customer delayed purchases of existing products in anticipation of new product releases 
we must also try to reduce the levels of older product and component inventories to minimize inventory write offs 
if we have excess inventory  it may be necessary to reduce our prices or write down inventory  which could result in lower gross margins 
additionally  our customers may delay orders for existing products in anticipation of new product introductions 
as a result  we may decide to adjust prices of our existing products during this process to try to increase customer demand for these products 
our future operating results would be materially and adversely affected if such pricing adjustments were to occur and we were unable to mitigate the resulting margin pressure by maintaining a favorable mix of systems  software  service and other products  or if we were unsuccessful in achieving component cost reductions  operating efficiencies and increasing sales volumes 
if we are unable to timely develop  manufacture  and introduce new products in sufficient quantity to meet customer demand at acceptable costs  or if we are unable to correctly anticipate customer demand for our new and existing products  our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
we face numerous risks associated with our strategic alliance with fujitsu 
we have entered into a number of agreements with fujitsu with respect to collaborative sales and marketing efforts and the joint development and manufacturing of server products known as the advanced product line apl 
the first group of apl server products was released in april and branded as the sun sparc enterprise line of servers 
the apl server products are intended to eventually replace a portion of our server product portfolio 
in addition  the agreements contemplate that sun and fujitsu dedicate substantial financial and human resources to this relationship 
as a result  our future performance and financial condition may be impacted by the success or failure of this relationship 
joint development and marketing of a complex new product line is an inherently difficult undertaking and is subject to numerous risks 
if we fail to satisfy certain development or supply obligations under the agreements  or if we otherwise violate the terms of the agreements  we may be subject to significant contractual or legal penalties 
further  if fujitsu encounters any of a number of potential problems in its business  such as intellectual property infringement claims  supply difficulties  or difficulties in meeting development milestones or financial challenges  these problems could impact our strategic relationship with them and could result in a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that our strategic relationship with fujitsu will be successful or that the economic terms of the agreements establishing the relationship will ultimately prove to be favorable to us 
if any of these risks come to pass  they may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 

table of contents we have licensed significant elements of our intellectual property  including our solaris operating system and java technology  as open source software and intend to license additional intellectual property in the future under open source licenses  which could reduce the competitive advantage we derive from this intellectual property 
we have released significant elements of our intellectual property  including the solaris operating system  the java enterprise system infrastructure software platform  the sun n management software and various developer tools  to the open source development community as open source software under an open source license and have made the hardware source code of our ultrasparc t processor available under an open source license 
we have also released our java se  java ee and java me technologies under an open source license 
although open source licensing models vary  generally open source software licenses permit the liberal copying  modification and distribution of a software program allowing a diverse programming community to contribute to the software 
as a result of such release  there could be an impact on revenue related to this intellectual property  and we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the future development of this intellectual property 
in particular  the feature set and functionality of the solaris operating system may diverge from those that best serve our strategic objectives  move in directions in which we do not have competitive expertise or fork into multiple  potentially incompatible variations 
we currently derive a significant competitive advantage from our development  licensing and sale of the solaris operating system  java technologies  and system products based on the ultrasparc family of microprocessors  and any of these events could reduce our competitive advantage or impact market demand for our products  software and services 
in addition  disclosing the content of our source code could limit the intellectual property protection we can obtain or maintain for that source code or the products containing that source code and could facilitate intellectual property infringement claims against sun 
our reliance on single source suppliers could delay product shipments and increase our costs 
most of the our products and components are manufactured in whole or in part by third party manufacturers 
further  there are some components that can only be purchased from a single vendor due to price  quality  technology or other business constraints 
for example  we currently depend on texas instruments for the manufacture of our ultrasparc microprocessors  amd for opteron processors and several other companies for custom integrated circuits 
if we were unable to purchase on acceptable terms or experienced significant delays or quality issues in the delivery of necessary parts and or components from a particular vendor and we had to find a new supplier for these parts and components  our new and existing product shipments could be delayed which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial conditions 
our future operating results depend on our ability to purchase a sufficient amount of components to meet the demands of our customers 
we depend heavily on our suppliers to design  develop  manufacture  and deliver on a timely basis the necessary components for our products 
while many of the components we purchase are standard  we do purchase some components standard or otherwise  including color monitors  custom power supplies  application specific integrated circuits asics and custom memory and graphics devices  that require long lead times to manufacture and deliver 
long lead times make it difficult for us to plan and procure appropriate component inventory levels to meet the customer demand for our products 
in addition  in the past  we have experienced shortages in certain of our components including  asics  dynamic random access memories drams and static random access memories srams 
if a component delivery from a supplier is delayed  if we experience a shortage in one or more components  or if we are unable to provide for adequate levels of component inventory  our new and existing product shipments could be delayed and our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
because we may order components from suppliers in advance of receipt of customer orders for our products that include these components  we could face a material inventory risk 
as part of our component planning  we place orders with or pay certain suppliers for components in advance of receipt of customer orders 
we occasionally negotiate supply commitments with vendors early in the manufacturing process of our microprocessors to make sure we have enough of these components for our products to meet anticipated customer demand 
because the design and manufacturing process for these components is very complicated it is possible that we could experience a design or manufacturing flaw that could delay or even prevent the production of the components for which we have previously committed to pay or need to fulfill orders from customers 
we also face the risk of ordering too many components  or conversely  not enough components  since supply orders are generally based on forecasts of customer orders rather than actual customer orders 
in addition  in some cases  we make non cancelable order commitments to our suppliers for work in progress  supplier s finished goods  custom sub assemblies and sun unique raw materials that are necessary to meet our lead times for finished goods 
if we cannot change or be released from supply orders  we could incur costs from the purchase of unusable components  either due to a delay in the production of the components or other supplies or as a result of inaccurately predicting 
table of contents supply orders in advance of customer orders 
our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected as a result of these increased costs 
delays in product development or customer acceptance and implementation of new products and technologies could seriously harm our business 
generally  the computer systems we sell to customers incorporate various hardware and software products that we sell  such as ultrasparc microprocessors  various software elements  from the solaris operating system to the java platform  sun java system portfolio  sun n grid  the sun storagetek sl modular library system and sun storedge array products 
any delay in the development  delivery or acceptance of key elements of the hardware or software included in our systems could delay our shipment of these systems 
delays in the development and introduction of our products may occur for various reasons 
in addition  if customers decided to delay the adoption and implementation of new releases of our solaris operating system  this could also delay customer acceptance of new hardware products tied to that release 
implementing a new release of an operating environment requires a great deal of time and money for a customer to convert its systems to the new release 
the customer must also work with software vendors who port their software applications to the new operating system and make sure these applications will run on the new operating system 
as a result  customers may decide to delay their adoption of a new release of an operating system because of the cost of a new system and the effort involved to implement it 
such delays in product development and customer acceptance and implementation of new products could materially and adversely affect our business 
our products may have quality issues that could adversely affect our sales and reputation 
in the course of conducting our business  we experience and address quality issues 
some of our hardware and software products contain defects  including defects in our engineering  design and manufacturing processes  as well as defects in third party components included in our products  which may be beyond our control 
often defects are identified during our design  development and manufacturing processes and we are able to correct many of these 
sometimes defects are identified after introduction and shipment of new products or enhancements to existing products 
when a quality issue is identified  we work extensively with our customers and our suppliers to remedy such issues 
we may test the affected product to determine the root cause of the problem and to determine appropriate solutions 
we may find an appropriate solution often called a patch or offer a temporary fix while a permanent solution is being determined 
if we are unable to determine the root cause  find an appropriate solution or offer a temporary fix  we may delay shipment to customers 
we may  however  ship products while we continue to explore a suitable solution if we believe the defect is not significant to the product s functionality 
defects in our products can harm our reputation  delay or prevent sales  result in significant expense and could materially and adversely affect our business 
our international customers and operations subject us to a number of risks 
currently  more than half of our revenues come from international sales 
in addition  a portion of our operations consists of manufacturing and sales activities outside of the us our ability to sell our products and conduct our operations internationally is subject to a number of risks 
local economic  political and labor conditions in each country could adversely affect demand for our products and services or disrupt our operations in these markets 
we may also experience reduced intellectual property protection or longer and more challenging collection cycles as a result of different customary business practices in certain countries where we do business which could have a material adverse effect on our business operations and financial results 
currency fluctuations could also materially and adversely affect our business in a number of ways 
although we take steps to reduce or eliminate certain foreign currency exposures that can be identified or quantified  we may incur currency translation losses as a result of our international operations 
further  in the event that currency fluctuations cause our products to become more expensive in overseas markets in local currencies  there could be a reduction in demand for our products or we could lower our pricing in some or all of these markets resulting in reduced revenue and margins 
alternatively  a weakening dollar could result in greater costs to us for our overseas operations 
changes to and compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may increase our cost of doing business in these jurisdictions 
trade protection measures and import and export licensing requirements subject us to additional regulation and may prevent us from shipping products to a particular market  and increase our operating costs 
in addition  we could be subject to regulations  fines and penalties for violations of import and export regulations 
although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws  there can be no assurance that all of our employees  contractors and agents  as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations  including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such united states laws may be customary  will not take actions in violations of our policies 
these violations could result in penalties  including prohibiting us from exporting our products to one or more countries  and could materially and adversely affect our business 
moreover  local laws and customs in many countries differ significantly from those in the us we incur additional legal compliance costs associated with our international operations and could become subject to legal penalties in foreign countries if 
table of contents we do not comply with local laws and regulations  which may be substantially different from those in the united states 
in many foreign countries  particularly in those with developing economies  it is common for local business people to engage in business practices that violate their local laws and that are prohibited by united states laws applicable to us such as the foreign corrupt practices act 
although we implement policies  training  and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws  there can be no assurance that all of our employees  contractors and agents  as well as our resellers and those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations  including those based in or from countries where practices which violate such united states laws may be common  will not engage in actions which violate the law or our policies 
any such violation  even if prohibited by our policies  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we intend to enter into one or more joint ventures with distribution partners with the goal of increasing sales of sun s products and services in selected geographic markets 
forming a joint venture will subject us to additional compliance and legal risks related to the actions of the joint venture partner 
we are currently implementing a new enterprise resource planning system  and problems with the design or implementation of this system could interfere with our business and operations 
we have commenced a project to consolidate all of our database infrastructure to a single global enterprise resource planning erp system 
we have invested  and will continue to invest  significant capital and human resources in the design and implementation of the erp system  which may be disruptive to our underlying business 
any disruptions or delays in the design and implementation of the new erp system  particularly any disruptions or delays that impact our operations  could adversely affect our ability to process customer orders  ship products  provide services and support to our customers  bill and track our customers  fulfill contractual obligations  file sec reports in a timely manner and otherwise run our business 
further  as we are dependent upon our ability to gather and promptly transmit accurate information to key decision makers  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected if our database infrastructure does not allow us to transmit accurate information  even for a short period of time 
even if we do encounter these adverse effects  the design and implementation of the new erp system may be much more costly than we anticipated 
if we are unable to successfully design and implement the new erp system as planned  our financial position  results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted 
failure to successfully implement our global resourcing activities could adversely affect our results of operations 
we continuously seek to make our cost structure more efficient and focus on our core strengths 
we continue to develop and implement our global resourcing strategy and operating model which includes activities that are focused on increasing workforce flexibility and scalability  and improving overall competitiveness by leveraging external talent and skills worldwide 
we rely on partners or third party service providers for the provision of certain key business process functions  including it services and the human resources function  and as a result  we may incur increased business continuity risks 
we may no longer be able to exercise control over some aspects of the future development  support or maintenance of outsourced operations and processes  including the internal controls associated with those outsourced business operations and processes  which could adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to effectively develop and implement our resourcing strategy due to  among other things  data protection  contract and regulatory compliance issues  we may not realize cost structure efficiencies and our operating and financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
given the uncertainty in forecasting and other variables  actual financial impact from outsourcing may materially differ from our projections 
in addition  if we are unable to effectively utilize or integrate and interoperate with external resources or if our partners or third party service providers experience business difficulties or are unable to provide business process services as anticipated  we may need to seek alternative service providers or resume providing these business processes internally  which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results 
we also rely on partners for the provision of key manufacturing activities 
recently  texas instruments indicated publicly that it will not be making ultrasparc microprocessors for sun on a foundry basis at the nm node 
consequently  we are reviewing alternative foundry solutions  and are considering plans to transition the nm mode foundry operations and supply chain to other potential vendors 
if we are unable to effectively execute the transition  we may experience difficulty in delivering our nm next generation microelectronics products and technologies  which could materially and adversely affect our business 
we expect our quarterly revenues  cash flows and operating results to fluctuate for a number of reasons 
future operating results and cash flows will continue to be subject to quarterly fluctuations based on a wide variety of factors  including seasonality 
although our sales and other operating results can be influenced by a number of factors and historical results are not necessarily indicative of future results  our sequential quarterly operating results generally fluctuate downward in the first and third quarters of each fiscal year when compared with the immediately preceding quarter 

table of contents linearity 
our quarterly sales have historically reflected a pattern in which a disproportionate percentage of such quarter s total revenues occur in the last month of the quarter 
this pattern can make prediction of revenues  earnings and working capital for each financial period difficult and uncertain and increase the risk of unanticipated variations in quarterly results and financial condition 
foreign currency fluctuations 
as a large portion of our business takes place outside of the us  we enter into transactions in other currencies 
although we employ various hedging strategies  we are exposed to changes in exchange rates  which cause fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
deferred tax assets 
estimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from net operating losses  tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  also requires that the deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance  if based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis 
in determining future taxable income  we are responsible for the assumptions utilized including the amount of state  federal and international pre tax operating income  the reversal of temporary differences and the implementation of feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
cumulative losses incurred in the us and certain foreign jurisdictions in recent years and insufficient forecasted future taxable income in certain other foreign jurisdictions represented sufficient negative evidence to require full and partial valuation allowances in these jurisdictions 
we have established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets in these jurisdictions  which will remain until sufficient positive evidence exists to support reversal 
future reversals or increases to our valuation allowance could have a significant impact on our future earnings 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform an analysis on our goodwill balances to test for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events occur that may indicate impairment possibly exists 
goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value 
the impairment of a long lived intangible asset is only deemed to have occurred if the sum of the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value of the intangible asset we are testing for impairment 
if the forecasted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then we must write down the carrying value to its estimated fair value 
we recognized an impairment charge of million related to acquired intangible assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal as of june   we had a goodwill balance of  million 
going forward  we will continue to review our goodwill and other intangible assets for possible impairment 
any additional impairment charges could adversely affect our future earnings 
income tax laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to income taxes in the us and various foreign jurisdictions 
our domestic and foreign tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of revenues and expenses in different jurisdictions 
additionally  the amount of income taxes paid is subject to our interpretation of applicable tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we are regularly subject to audits by tax authorities 
while we endeavor to comply with all applicable income tax laws  there can be no assurance that a governing tax authority will not have a different interpretation of the law than we do or that we will comply in all respects with applicable tax laws  which could result in additional taxes 
we regularly review the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from tax audits to determine if additional income taxes  penalties and interest would be assessed 
there can be no assurance that the outcomes from these audits will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations in the period for which the review is made 
we are dependent on significant customers  specific industries and geographies 
in january  access distribution  the largest distributor of our products  was sold to avnet  inc by general electric company the acquisition 
sales to avnet and access distribution accounted for approximately   and of net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
avnet  which was storagetek s largest distributor  became a distributor of sun products after our acquisition of storagetek in august no other customer accounted for more than of our net revenues 
the acquisition may be disruptive to avnet s business and could  consequently  adversely impact our business 
moreover  if our distribution arrangement with avnet significantly deteriorates or is terminated  and we are unable to find another distributor for our products on similar financial terms  our future operating results could be adversely affected 

table of contents we also depend on the telecommunications  financial services and government sectors for a significant portion of our revenues 
our revenues are dependent on the level of technology capital spending in the us and international economies 
if capital spending declines in these industries over an extended period of time  our business will continue to be materially and adversely affected 
we continue to execute on our strategy to reduce our dependence on these industries by expanding our product reach into new industries  but no assurance can be given that this strategy will be successful 
weakening economic conditions in specific geographic areas  particularly the united states or europe  can also adversely affect our operating results 
we are dependent upon our channel partners for a significant portion of our revenues 
our channel partners include distributors  original equipment manufacturers oems  independent software vendors  system integrators  service providers and resellers 
we continue to see an increase in revenues via our reseller channel 
we face ongoing business risks due to our reliance on our channel partners to maintain customer relationships and create customer demand with customers where we have a limited or no direct relationship 
should our relationships with our channel partners or their effectiveness decline  we face risk of declining demand which could affect our results of operations 
adverse resolution of litigation may harm our operating results or financial condition 
we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
litigation can be expensive  lengthy  and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
an unfavorable resolution of a particular lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
we are currently involved in litigation with the general services administration gsa and the department of energy doe 
additional information is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements in item our business may suffer if it is alleged or found that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others 
from time to time we have been notified that we may be infringing certain patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
responding to such claims  regardless of their merit  can be time consuming  result in costly litigation  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
there are often several pending claims in various stages of evaluation at any particular time 
from time to time  we consider the desirability of entering into licensing agreements in certain of these claims 
no assurance can be given that licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur 
in the event there is a temporary or permanent injunction entered prohibiting us from marketing or selling certain of our products  or a successful claim of infringement against us requiring us to pay royalties to a third party  and we fail to license such technology on acceptable terms and conditions or to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
our acquisition  divestiture and alliance activities could disrupt our ongoing business and subject us to significant risks 
we expect to continue to make investments in companies  products  and technologies  either through acquisitions or investments or alliances 
for example  we have purchased several companies in the past  including storagetek and seebeyond  and have also formed alliances  such as our strategic relationship with fujitsu for the development  manufacturing and marketing of server products and our oem relationship with hitachi data systems for the collaboration on  and delivery of  a broad range of storage products and services 
we also rely on it services partners and independent software developers to enhance the value to our customers of our products and services 
acquisitions and alliance activities often involve risks  including difficulty in assimilating the acquired operations and employees  difficulty in managing product co development activities with our alliance partners  retaining the key employees of the acquired operation  disruption of our or the acquired company s ongoing business  inability to successfully integrate the acquired technology and operations into our business and maintain uniform standards  controls  policies  and procedures  and lacking the experience to enter into new product or technology markets 
in addition  from time to time  our competitors acquire or enter into exclusive arrangements with companies with whom we do business or may do business in the future 
reductions in the number of partners with whom we may do business in a particular context may reduce our ability to enter into critical alliances on attractive terms or at all  and the termination of an existing alliance by a business partner may disrupt our operations 
from time to time  we evaluate our products and service offerings and may adjust our strategic priorities by reducing investment in or divesting certain business operations 
decisions to eliminate or divest certain business operations may involve a number of risks  including the diversion of management s attention  significant costs and expenses  the assumption of contractual obligations  realization of losses  facility consolidation  the loss or disruption of customer relationships  the loss of employees  the elimination of revenues along with associated costs and the disruption of operations in the affected business or related businesses  any of which could cause our operating results to decline and may fail to yield the expected benefits 

table of contents we may be materially affected by a decrease in demand for our tape products or by an inability to maintain key competitive advantages in tape 
as a result of the acquisition of storagetek  a significant portion of storage products revenue is generated by sales of our tape products 
if overall demand for tape storage products declines  or if we lose significant market share in tape  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
one of the key competitive advantages that our tape products have over competing disk products is that tape products store data at a fraction of the price of disk storage 
the price of disk storage continues to decrease rapidly due to competition and decreasing manufacturing costs 
we must continue to develop and introduce new tape products that reduce the cost of tape storage at a rate that is similar to or greater than the decline in disk storage costs in order to maintain this competitive advantage 
for a discussion of risk associated with new products  see the products we make are very complex 
if we are unable to rapidly and successfully develop and introduce new products and manage our inventory  we will not be able to satisfy customer demand  above 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to reduce the price of our tape products at a rate similar to the decline in disk storage costs 
credit rating downgrades could adversely affect our business and financial condition 
three credit rating agencies follow sun 
fitch ratings has rated us bbb  which is an investment grade rating 
moody s investor services and standard poor s have assigned us non investment grade ratings of ba and bb  respectively 
all three credit rating agencies have placed us on stable outlook 
these ratings reflect those credit agencies expectations that the intense competitive environment facing sun in its core markets will continue to challenge our revenue and profitability  at least over the near term 
if we were to be downgraded by these ratings agencies  such downgrades could increase our costs of obtaining  or make it more difficult to obtain or issue  new debt financing 
any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition 
we depend on key employees and face competition in hiring and retaining qualified employees 
our employees are vital to our success  and our key management  engineering  and other employees are difficult to replace 
we generally do not have employment contracts with our key employees 
further  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our employees 
because our compensation packages include equity based incentives  pressure on our stock price could affect our ability to offer competitive compensation packages to current employees 
in addition  we must continue to motivate employees and keep them focused on our strategies and goals  which may be difficult due to morale challenges posed by our workforce reductions  global resourcing strategies and related uncertainties 
should these conditions continue  we may not be able to retain highly qualified employees in the future which could adversely affect our business 
our use of a self insurance program to cover certain claims for losses suffered and costs or expenses incurred could negatively impact our business upon the occurrence of an uninsured event 
we maintain a program of insurance with third party insurers for certain property  casualty and other risks 
the policies are subject to deductibles and exclusions that result in our retention of a level of risk on a self insurance basis 
we retain risk with regard to certain loss events  such as california earthquakes  the indemnification or defense payments we  as a company  may make to or on behalf of our directors and officers as a result of obligations under applicable agreements  our by laws and applicable law  and for potential liabilities that are not insured  and we sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees 
the types and amounts of insurance obtained vary from time to time and from location to location  depending on availability  cost  and our decisions with respect to risk retention 
in the event that the frequency of losses experienced by us increased unexpectedly  the aggregate of such losses could materially increase our liability and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  because the insurance market continues to limit the availability of certain insurance products and because the costs of certain products continue to increase  we will continue to evaluate the types and magnitudes of claims we include in our self insurance program 
additions and changes to this self insurance program may increase our risk exposure and therefore increase the risk of a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity  cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  we have made certain judgments as to the limits on our existing insurance coverage that we believe are in line with industry standards  as well as in light of economic and product availability considerations 
unforeseen catastrophic loss scenarios could prove our limits to be inadequate  and losses incurred in connection with the known claims we self insure could be substantial 
either of these circumstances could materially adversely affect our financial and business condition 
business interruptions could adversely affect our business 
our operations and those of our suppliers are vulnerable to interruption by fire  earthquake  power loss  telecommunications failure  terrorist attacks and other events beyond our control 
a substantial portion of our facilities  including our corporate 
table of contents headquarters and other critical business operations  are located near major earthquake faults 
in addition  some of our facilities are located on filled land and  therefore  may be more susceptible to damage if an earthquake occurs 
we generally do not carry earthquake insurance for direct earthquake related losses 
in addition  we do not carry business interruption insurance for  nor do we carry financial reserves against  business interruptions arising from earthquakes or certain other events 
if a business interruption occurs  our business could be materially and adversely affected 
our failure to comply with contractual obligations may result in significant penalties 
we offer terms to some of our distributors and other customers that  in some cases  include complex provisions for pricing  data protection and other terms 
in connection with these contracts  we are in some cases required to allow the customer to audit certain of our records to verify compliance with these terms 
in particular  government agency customers audit and investigate government contractors  including us 
these agencies review our performance under the applicable contracts as well as compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
the government also may review the adequacy of  and our compliance with  contractual obligations  our internal control systems and policies  including our purchasing  property  estimating  compensation  management information systems and data protection requirements 
if an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities  we may be subject to claims for damages  penalties and other sanctions 
with respect to claims by government agencies  sanctions may include treble damages  fines and possibly debarment or suspension from sales to the federal government 
in addition  we may suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us 
the federal government has intervened in a case filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of arkansas alleging that sun has violated the federal false claims and anti kickback acts and breached our contracts with the general services administration gsa  among other claims 
these claims are based in part on certain audit reports prepared by the gsa office of the inspector general with respect to our prior gsa multi award schedule 
claims by the federal government pursuant to the lawsuit or otherwise in the administration of our contracts  and any judgment or settlement related thereto  could expose us to damages  penalties and other sanctions  up to and including debarment or suspension from federal sales  loss of sales opportunities  business interruption and damage to our reputation 
some of our restructuring plans may not result in the anticipated cost saving and benefits 
since march  our board of directors and our management have approved a series of restructuring plans including the restructuring plan announced on august  our ability to achieve the cost savings and operating efficiencies anticipated by these restructuring plans is dependent on our ability to effectively implement the workforce and excess capacity reductions contemplated 
if we are unable to implement these initiatives effectively  we may not achieve the level of cost savings and efficiency benefits expected for fiscal and beyond 
commercial real estate market conditions could affect our ability to sublease properties in our portfolio 
we implemented facility exit plans in each of the last six fiscal years as part of our ongoing efforts to consolidate excess facilities 
the commercial real estate market conditions in the united states and in many of the countries in which we have significant leased properties have resulted in a surplus of business facilities making it difficult to sublease properties 
we may be unable to sublease our excess properties  or we may not meet our expected estimated levels of sublease income  and  accordingly  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
environmental laws and regulations subject us to a number of risks and could result in significant liabilities and costs 
some of our operations are subject to state  federal  and international laws governing protection of the environment  human health and safety  and regulating the use of certain chemical substances 
we endeavor to comply with these environmental laws  yet compliance with such laws could increase our operations and product costs  increase the complexities of product design  development  procurement  and manufacture  limit our ability to manage excess and obsolete non compliant inventory  limit our sales activities  and impact our future financial results 
any violation of these laws can subject us to significant liability  including fines  penalties  and possible prohibition of sales of our products into one or more states or countries  and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
currently  a significant portion of our revenues come from international sales 
recent environmental legislation within the european union eu  including the eu directive on waste electrical and electronic equipment weee and the eu directive on restriction of hazardous substances rohs  may increase our cost of doing business internationally and impact our revenues from eu countries as we endeavor to comply with and implement these requirements 
in addition  similar environmental legislation has been or may be enacted in other jurisdictions  including the us under federal and state laws  china  japan  canada  korea and certain latin american countries  the cumulative impact of which 
table of contents could be significant 
we are committed to offering products that are environmentally responsible and to complying with any current or future laws protecting the environment  human health and safety 
we may not realize the economic return expected from the acquired in process research and development iprd 
during fiscal  we recorded total in process research and development expense of million related to our acquisitions of storagetek and seebeyond 
at the time of the acquisitions  we believed there was a reasonable chance of realizing the economic return expected from the acquired in process technology 
however  as there is risk associated with the realization of benefits related to commercialization of an in process project due to rapidly changing customer needs  the complexity of technology  and growing competitive pressures  there can be no assurance that any project will meet commercial success 
we continue to make substantial progress related to the development and commercialization of acquired technologies 
with respect to storagetek and seebeyond  key product releases and major enhancements contemplated by acquired iprd projects were completed for all significant projects during fy  with the exception of vsm open solution which is scheduled for release during q fy in addition  ongoing feature and function enhancements on all of our acquired iprd projects are expected to continue for several more years 
although we have experienced delays in the completion of certain of our development efforts and their related commercialization  the expected total costs to complete such technologies have not materially increased  individually or in the aggregate  from our estimates at the time of the acquisitions 
however  failure to successfully commercialize an in process project  or unanticipated costs to complete such technologies  would result in the loss of the expected economic return inherent in the fair value allocation 
additionally  the value of our intangible assets may become impaired 
our ongoing restructuring plans may also impact the expected economic return from acquired in process technology 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as a result of our phase vi restructuring activities  we exited certain storagetek product lines comprising million of the total million assigned to iprd as of the acquisition date 
future economic benefits for these iprd projects will not be realized 
our business may suffer if it is alleged or found that we or our contractors have violated data privacy or confidentiality obligations 
compliance with a variety of domestic and foreign laws and regulations related to data privacy  as well as various contractual obligations related to confidentiality  increase our cost of doing business 
such obligations include regulations related to the protection of various types of data and information  such as personal healthcare information  personally identifiable information and other confidential information 
although we implement policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these obligations  there can be no assurance that all of our employees  contractors and agents  as well as those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations  will not take actions in violations of our policies 
further  our ability to comply with these obligations may depend upon future investments in systems and processes  and such investments may have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
failure to comply with these obligations  or even allegations that we have failed to comply with these obligations  may also cause a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  or financial condition 
our stock price can be volatile 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  continues to be volatile 
for example  our stock price can be affected by many factors such as quarterly increases or decreases in our earnings  speculation in the investment community about our financial condition or results of operations and changes in revenue or earnings estimates  downgrades in our credit ratings  announcement of new products  technological developments  alliances  acquisitions or divestitures by us or one of our competitors or the loss of key management personnel 
in addition  general macroeconomic and market conditions unrelated to our financial performance may also affect our stock price 
the accounting method for convertible debt securities with net share settlement  like our convertible notes  may be subject to change 
on january   we issued million of convertible notes with a net share settlement feature 
for the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share  a convertible debt security providing for net share settlement of the conversion value and meeting specified requirements under eitf issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock net share convertibles  is accounted for interest expense purposes similarly to non convertible debt  with the stated coupon constituting interest expense and any shares issuable upon conversion of the security being accounted for under the treasury stock method 
the effect of the treasury stock method is that the shares potentially issuable upon conversion of the notes are not included in the calculation of our earnings per share except to the 
table of contents extent that the conversion value of the notes exceeds their principal amount  in which case the number of shares of our common stock necessary to settle the conversion are treated as having been issued for earnings per share purposes 
at the july  fasb meeting  the board agreed to issue for comment a proposed fasb staff position fsp addressing convertible instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion 
the proposed fsp  as expected to be drafted  would require  among other things  the issuer to separately account for the liability and equity components of the instrument in a manner that reflects the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate and would be effective for fiscal periods beginning after december  we cannot predict the outcome of the eitf deliberations or any other changes in gaap that may be made affecting accounting for convertible debt securities 
any change in the accounting method for convertible debt securities could have an adverse impact on our past or future financial results 
in addition  these impacts could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations 
pursuant to the sarbanes oxley act of  we are required to provide a report by management on internal control over financial reporting  including management s assessment of the effectiveness of such control 
internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations  including the possibility of human error  the circumvention or overriding of controls  or fraud 
therefore  even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements 
in addition  projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions  or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate 
if we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls  including any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or if we experiences difficulties in their implementation  our business and operating results could be harmed  we could fail to meet our reporting obligations  and there could be a material adverse effect on our stock price
