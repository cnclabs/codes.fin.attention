item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our unaudited consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  within the meaning of section a of securities act of  as amended  section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and the private securities litigation reform act of  including statements regarding our expected financial position  business and financing plans 
these statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from the results described in or implied by these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report  particularly under the headings disclosure statement and risk factors 
overview we are a global provider of information technology  or it  services and end to end business solutions designed to help clients improve their competitiveness and effectiveness 
end to end business solutions encompass all stages of a client s business process and incorporate all technologies and it services related to that process 
our portfolio of solutions and services includes outsourcing  system integration and application development  software and consulting  and quality assurance and training 
the primary industries  or verticals  we serve include government and defense  financial services  life sciences and healthcare  telecommunications and utilities  and independent software vendors  or isvs 
we have operations in countries across north america  europe and asia 
we combine our deep vertical expertise and strong technical capabilities to provide a complete range of high quality services on a global scale 
by integrating our local and international personnel in focused business and project teams  this global delivery model leverages our corporate knowledge and experience  intellectual property and global infrastructure to develop innovative solutions for clients across the geographies and verticals we serve 
we complement this global delivery model with our offshore delivery capabilities to achieve meaningful cost reductions or other benefits for our clients 
our revenues increased to million for  from million for net income increased to million for  from million for our revenue growth is attributable to a number of factors  including acquisitions we made  increases in the number and size of projects for existing clients  and the addition of new clients 
our client base is diverse  and we are not dependent on any single client 
in  no client accounted for more than of our revenues and our largest twenty clients together accounted for approximately of our revenues 
for  the percentage of our revenues generated by public and private clients in israel was  and the percentage of our revenues derived  in aggregate  from agencies of the government of israel was 
existing clients from prior years generated more than of our revenues in our backlog as of december  was million compared to million as of december  this million increase in our backlog was due primarily to new bookings 
we achieve backlog through new signings of it services projects and outsourcing contracts  including for new and repeat customers 
we recognize backlog as revenue when we perform the services related to backlog 
for  the impact of inflation and changing prices on net sales and revenues and on income from continuing operations was insignificant 
as of december   trade receivables and other accounts receivable and prepaid expenses included a total balance of approximately million from one of our clients  an israeli insurance company  with whom we are currently in a contract dispute see item legal proceedings 
as of december   we had approximately  employees  including approximately  it professionals 
of the  employees  approximately  were in israel   were in india  were in north america  were in europe and were in the asia pacific region 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
the actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and which could result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
application of these policies is particularly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that the accounting policies described below meet these characteristics 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate our revenues from contracts for system integration and application development services  outsourcing  consultation  quality assurance and training services as well sales of third party software licenses 
we provide services on either a fixed price or time and materials basis 
for time and materials contracts  we recognize revenues as services are performed based on the hours actually incurred at the negotiated billing rates 
we also charge our clients for certain costs and expenses  such as the installation of hardware and cost of subcontractors 
our fixed price contracts relate primarily to long term development projects 
such projects that require significant customization  integration and installation are recognized in accordance with sop no 
accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we recognize revenues related to these contracts using the percentage of completion method based on the percentage of costs incurred to date in relation to the total estimated costs expected upon completion 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions regarding the resources and time required to fulfill the contracts obligations including work effort  materials and subcontractors 
we rely on our experience from other projects in making these estimates  and  in addition  use our internal project management and financial systems to track and manage the projects 
employees and project managers regularly submit updates to these systems  which are then used by executive management to monitor the projects and revise the estimates  if necessary 
these systems  which are updated on a regular basis by inputs from employees and project managers estimates  produce analyses and are used by executive management to monitor the projects and revise the estimates  if necessary 
historically  our estimates have been indicative of our actual results  however  there have been a few cases where we had to adjust assumptions  primarily regarding work effort 
we generally recognize revenues on a gross basis  representing the entire amount  because we bear the risks and rewards of ownership  including the risk of loss for collection  delivery and returns  and have latitude in establishing product pricing above specific minimums 
management determines whether we bear the risks and rewards of ownership based on relevant sale contract terms 
whenever the majority of contract terms indicate that we bear the risks and rewards  revenues are recognized on a gross basis 
for most software license sales and hardware sales  we record revenues on a net basis  based on management s determination that majority of contract terms indicate that we do not bear the risks and rewards related to such contracts 
for arrangements that involve multiple revenue activities  ie  the delivery or performance of multiple products and services  management allocates the associated consideration to the separate activities based on their relative fair values 
in order to determine the fair values of the different activities covered by each agreement  management applies standard pricing used for products and services in similar arrangements and hourly rates based on similar activities we have performed for other clients 
for contracts entered into with the same party at or near the same time  management evaluates on a case by case basis  based on the specific circumstances  whether to account for these contracts as a single arrangement or separate contracts 
our revenue recognition approach for software licensing requires that  in accordance with statement of position no 
software revenue recognition as amended  four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and is based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered  and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is determined by evaluating the credit worthiness of each client based upon market capitalization and other information  including the aging of the receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in each financial period  we estimate the likelihood of collecting every receivable and record a cumulative allowance 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed  based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license and service sales  maintenance agreements  customer contracts and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand awareness and discount rate 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
goodwill sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment on adoption and at least annually thereafter or between annual tests in certain circumstances  and written down when impaired  rather than amortized as previous accounting standards required 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
fair value is determined using discounted cash flows  market multiples and market capitalization 
significant estimates used in the methodologies include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long term growth rates  and weighted average cost of capital for the reportable unit 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for our goodwill 
as of december   no impairment losses were identified 
realizability of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our long lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in measuring the recoverability of assets  we are required to make estimates and judgments in assessing our forecast and cash flows and compare that with the carrying amount of the assets 
additional significant estimates used by management in the methodologies used to assess the recoverability of our long lived assets include estimates of future cash flows  future short term and long tem growth rates  market acceptance of products and services  and other judgmental assumptions  which are also affected by factors detailed in our risk factors section in this annual report 
if these estimates or the related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for our long lived assets 
as of december  and  no impairment losses were identified 
tax accounting as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expenses that qualify for preferential tax treatment and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure  which is accrued as taxes payable  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting differences 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we may record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and that we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax strategies in estimating our tax outcome and in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the final tax outcome and the valuation allowance will not be different than those that are reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision  net income and cash balances in the period in which such determination is made 
we have filed  or are in the process of filing  federal  state and foreign tax returns that are subject to audit by the respective tax authorities 
although the ultimate outcome is unknown  we believe that adequate amounts have been provided for and any adjustments that may result from tax return audits are not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r utilizing the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires employee stock options to be valued at their fair value on the date of grant and charged to expense over the applicable service period 
under the modified prospective method  compensation expense is recognized for all share based payments issued on or after january  and for all share based payments issued to employees prior to january  that remain unvested 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for share based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  under which we recognized compensation expense when the exercise price of our share options was less than the fair market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
adoption of sfas r did not change our accounting for share based payments issued to non employees 
sfas r requires management to estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model  where applicable 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on our compensation expense 
severance pay the liability of our israeli subsidiaries for severance pay is calculated pursuant to israel s severance pay law based on the most recent salary of israeli employees multiplied by the number of years of employment  as of the balance sheet date 
employees are entitled to one month s salary for each year of employment or a portion thereof 
this liability is fully provided for by monthly deposits into severance pay funds  insurance policies and by an accrual 
the value of these policies is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet 
the deposited funds may be withdrawn only upon the fulfillment of the obligation pursuant to israel s severance pay law or labor agreements 
the value of the deposited funds is based on the cash surrender value of these policies  and includes immaterial profits

expenses included in segment operating profit consist principally of direct selling  general  administrative and delivery costs 
certain general and administrative expenses and a portion of depreciation and amortization are not specifically allocated to specific segments as management believes they are not directly attributable to any specific segment 
accordingly  these expenses are categorized as unallocated expenses and adjusted against our total income from operations 
additionally  our management has determined that it is not practical to allocate certain identifiable assets by segment  when such assets are used interchangeably among the segments

anticipated capital expenditures our only material indebtedness is amounts owed by ness at ltd  one of our subsidiaries  to israel discount bank 
the relevant debt instruments contain customary restrictive covenants relating to the borrower  including the following a negative pledge  stockholders equity must not be less than of its total assets  and limitations on merging or transferring assets 
as of december   we are in compliance and expect to remain in compliance with all of our covenants 
our failure to comply with these covenants could lead to an event of default under the agreements governing some or all of the indebtedness  permitting the applicable lender to accelerate all borrowings under the applicable agreement  and to foreclose on any collateral 
anticipated needs we intend to fund future growth through future cash flow from operations  available bank borrowings and the remaining net proceeds of our initial public offering 
we believe the remaining balance of the proceeds of our initial public offering  together with borrowings and future cash flow from operations  will be sufficient to fund continuing operations for the foreseeable future 
in order to achieve our strategic business objectives  we may be required to seek additional financing 
for example  future acquisitions may require additional equity and or debt financing 
in addition  we may require further capital to continue to enhance our infrastructure and for working capital purposes 
these financings may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  investments in special purpose entities or undisclosed borrowings or debt 
in addition  we have not entered into any derivative contracts or any synthetic leases
