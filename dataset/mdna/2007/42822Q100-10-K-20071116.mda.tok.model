item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if an impairment charge is required in the future  the charge would negatively impact reported earnings in the period of the charge 

table of contents our business will be negatively affected if we are not able to anticipate and keep pace with rapid changes in government regulations or if government regulations decrease the need for our services or increase our costs 
the areas in which we provide outsourcing and consulting services are the subject of government regulation which is constantly evolving 
changes in government regulations in the united states  our principal geographic market  affecting the value  use or delivery of benefits and human resources programs  including changes in regulations relating to health and welfare such as medical plans  defined contribution such as k plans  defined benefit such as pension plans or payroll delivery  may adversely affect the demand for or profitability of our services 
in addition  our growth strategy includes a number of global expansion objectives which further subject us to applicable laws and regulations of countries outside the united states 
if we are unable to adapt our services to applicable laws and regulations  our ability to grow our business or to provide effective outsourcing and consulting services in these areas will be negatively impacted 
recently  we have seen regulatory initiatives in both the united states and certain european countries result in companies either discontinuing their defined benefit programs or de emphasizing the importance such programs play in the overall mix of their benefit programs with a trend toward increased use of defined contribution plans 
if organizations shift to defined contribution plans more rapidly than we anticipate  our results of operation of our business could be adversely affected 
if we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements relating to internal controls over financial reporting  our business could suffer 
effective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  both our reputation in the marketplace and our financial results could suffer 
we have spent considerable resources reviewing and implementing improvements to our internal controls 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
inadequate internal controls could also cause our clients or our investors to lose confidence in our services delivery or reported financial information  which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock 
our business performance and growth plans will be negatively affected if we are not able to effectively apply technology in driving value for our clients through technology based solutions or gain internal efficiencies through the effective application of technology and related tools 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to develop and implement technology solutions that anticipate and keep pace with rapid and continuing changes in technology  industry standards and client preferences 
we may not be successful in anticipating or responding to these developments on a timely and cost effective basis  and our ideas may not be accepted in the marketplace 
additionally  the effort to gain technological expertise and develop new technologies in our business requires us to incur significant expenses 
if we cannot offer new technologies as quickly as our competitors or if our competitors develop more cost effective technologies  it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to obtain and complete client engagements 
our business is also dependent  in part  upon continued growth in the use of technology in business by our clients and prospective clients and their employees and our ability to deliver the efficiencies and convenience afforded by technology 
if growth in the use of technology does not continue  demand for our services may decrease 
use of new technology for commerce generally requires understanding and acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information 
companies that have already invested substantial resources in traditional means of conducting commerce and exchanging information may be particularly reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach that would not utilize their existing personnel and infrastructure 

table of contents if our clients or third parties are not satisfied with our services  we may face damage to our professional reputation or legal liability 
we depend  to a large extent  on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high quality outsourcing and consulting services 
as a result  if a client is not satisfied with our services  it may be more damaging in our business than in other businesses 
moreover  if we fail to meet our contractual obligations  we could be subject to legal liability or loss of client relationships 
the nature of our work  especially our actuarial services  involves assumptions and estimates concerning future events  the actual outcome of which we cannot know with certainty in advance 
in addition  we could make computational  software programming or data management errors 
further  a client may claim it suffered losses due to reliance on our consulting advice 
defending lawsuits arising out of any of our services could require substantial amounts of management attention  which could adversely affect our financial performance 
our exposure to liability on a particular engagement may be greater than the profit opportunity of the engagement 
in addition to client liability  governmental authorities may impose penalties with respect to our errors or omissions and may preclude us from doing business in relevant jurisdictions 
in addition to the risks of liability exposure and increased costs of defense and insurance premiums  claims arising from our professional services may produce publicity that could hurt our reputation and business 
improper disclosure of personal data could result in liability and harm our reputation 
one of our significant responsibilities is to maintain the security and privacy of our clients confidential and proprietary information and the personal data of their employees and plan participants 
we have established several policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information 
although we continue to review and improve our policies and procedures  it is possible that our security controls over personal data  our training of employees and vendors on data security  and other practices we follow may not prevent the improper access to or disclosure of personally identifiable information 
such disclosure could harm our reputation and subject us to liability under our contracts and laws that protect personal data  resulting in increased costs or loss of revenue 
further  data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations  which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services 
our failure to adhere to or successfully implement processes in response to changing regulatory requirements in this area could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace 
we depend on our employees  the inability to attract new talent or the loss of key employees could damage or result in the loss of client relationships and adversely affect our business 
our success and ability to grow are dependent  in part  on our ability to hire and retain large numbers of talented people 
in particular  our employees personal relationships with our clients are an important element of obtaining and maintaining client engagements 
the inability to attract qualified employees in sufficient numbers to meet demand or losing employees who manage substantial client relationships or possess substantial experience or expertise could adversely affect our ability to secure and complete engagements  which would adversely affect our results of operations 
since our initial public offering  we have made  and anticipate making in the future  equity based awards to many of our employees to serve  in part  as an incentive to remain employed with the company 
our ability to provide equity based incentives in the future is dependent  in part  on obtaining approval of our shareholders of any new equity based incentive plans 
should we not obtain such approval and be unable to provide equity based awards  our ability to continue to attract new talent and retain new employees will likely be adversely affected 
in addition  should we obtain continued approval and issue equity based awards  the incentives provided by these awards may not be effective in attracting new talent or causing then current employees to stay with our organization 
our global operations and expansion strategy pose complex management  foreign currency  legal  tax and economic risks  which we may not adequately address 
as of september   we had a total of offices in countries and additional offices in additional countries through joint ventures and minority investments 
in fiscal  approximately of our total revenues were attributable to activities in the united states and approximately of our revenues were attributable to our activities in europe  canada  the asia pacific region 
table of contents and latin america 
our ability to provide services from global locations having lower cost structures than the united states and continued penetration of markets beyond the united states are important components of the our growth strategy 
a number of risks may inhibit our international operations and global sourcing efforts  preventing us from realizing our global expansion objectives  including insufficient demand for our services in foreign jurisdictions  which may be due to applicable laws and regulations or benefit practices in such jurisdictions  ability to execute effective and efficient cross border sourcing of services on behalf of our clients  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  and us laws  regulating operations outside the us  including but not limited to regulations regarding the flow and transfer of data and other information between countries  multiple and possibly overlapping and conflicting tax laws  restrictions on the movement of cash  political instability and international terrorism  currency fluctuations  longer payment cycles  restrictions on the import and export of technologies  price controls or restrictions on exchange of foreign currencies  and trade barriers 
the demand for our services may not grow at rates we anticipate 
we continue to devote significant attention to our hr bpo services offering 
the market for hr bpo services continues to develop  and we continue to modify our service offering to meet market need and provide the quality of services our clients expect of us at acceptable margins 
our offering may not be well received by our clients  or the demand for human resources business process outsourcing may not grow as rapidly as we anticipate  which could have an adverse impact on our revenues and profit margins 
in addition  the growth for certain benefits outsourcing services has slowed  particularly in the large plan market over  participants 
most companies have already outsourced their defined contribution plans  many companies have frozen their defined benefit plans and few new defined benefit plans are being adopted 
some larger companies that have not previously outsourced some of their benefit programs may wish to continue to administer such programs themselves rather than outsource a larger portion of their human resources function 
if a greater percentage of such organizations than we anticipate determine not to outsource such programs  it could also have an adverse impact on our revenues and profit margins 
if we fail to establish and maintain alliances for developing  marketing and delivering our services  our ability to increase our revenues and profitability may suffer 
our growth depends  in part  on our ability to develop and maintain alliances with businesses such as brokerage firms  financial services companies  health care organizations  insurance companies  other business process outsourcing organizations and other companies in order to develop  market and deliver our services 
if our strategic alliances are discontinued or we have difficulty developing new alliances  our ability to increase or maintain our client base may be substantially diminished 
we rely on third parties to provide services and their failure to perform the service could do harm to our business 
as part of providing services to clients  we rely on a number of third party service providers 
these providers include  but are not limited to  plan trustees and payroll service providers responsible for transferring funds to employees or on behalf of employees  and providers of data and information  such as software vendors  health plan providers  investment managers and investment advisers  that we work with to provide information to clients employees 
those providers also include providers of human resource functions such as recruiters and trainers employed by us in connection with our human resources business processing services delivered to our clients 
failure of third party service providers to perform in a timely manner could result in contractual or regulatory penalties  liability claims from clients and or employees  damage to our reputation and harm to our business 

table of contents we have only a limited ability to protect the intellectual property rights that are important to our success  and we face the risk that our services or products may infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property 
existing laws of some countries in which we provide or intend to provide services or products may offer only limited protection of our intellectual property rights 
we rely upon a combination of trade secrets  confidentiality policies  non disclosure and other contractual arrangements and copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights 
the steps we take in this regard may not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property  and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce our intellectual property rights 
protecting our intellectual property rights may also consume significant management time and resources 
we cannot be sure that our services and products  or the products of others that we offer to our clients  do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties  and we may have infringement claims asserted against us or against our clients 
these claims may harm our reputation  result in financial liabilities and prevent us from offering some services or products 
we have generally agreed in our outsourcing contracts to indemnify our clients for any expenses or liabilities resulting from claimed infringements of the intellectual property rights of third parties 
in some instances  the amount of these indemnities may be greater than the revenues we receive from the client 
any claims or litigation in this area  whether we ultimately win or lose  could be time consuming and costly  injure our reputation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
we may not be able to enter into these royalty or licensing arrangements on acceptable terms 
any limitation on our ability to provide a service or product could cause us to lose revenue generating opportunities and require us to incur additional expenses to develop new or modified solutions for future projects 
we rely heavily on our computing and communications infrastructure and the integrity of these systems in the delivery of services for our clients  and our operational performance and revenue growth depends  in part  on the reliability and functionality of this infrastructure as a means of delivering human resources services 
the internet is a key mechanism for delivering our services to our clients efficiently and cost effectively 
our clients may not be receptive to human resource services delivered over the internet due to concerns regarding transaction security  user privacy  the reliability and quality of internet service and other reasons 
our clients concerns may be heightened by the fact we use the internet to transmit extremely confidential information about our clients and their employees  such as compensation  medical information and other personally identifiable information 
in addition  the internet has experienced  and is expected to continue to experience  significant growth in the number of users and volume of traffic 
as a result  its performance and reliability may decline 
in order to maintain the level of security  service and reliability that our clients require  we may be required to make significant investments in our on line means of delivering human resources services 
in addition  websites and proprietary on line services have experienced service interruptions and other delays occurring throughout their infrastructure 
if these outages or delays occur frequently in the future  internet usage as a medium of exchange of information could grow more slowly or decline and the internet might not adequately support our web based tools 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations with respect to the internet may impede the efficiency of the internet as a medium of exchange of information and decrease the demand for our services 
if we cannot use the internet effectively to deliver our services  our revenue growth and results of operation may be impaired 
we may lose client data as a result of major catastrophes and other similar problems that may materially adversely impact our operations 
we have multiple processing centers around the globe which use various commercial methods for disaster recovery capabilities 
our main data processing center  located in lincolnshire  illinois is in a dual separate data center configuration to provide back up capabilities 
in the event of a disaster  we have developed business continuity plans  however  they may not be sufficient  and the data recovered may not be sufficient for the administration of our clients human resources programs and processes 

table of contents our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability will vary from quarter to quarter  which may result in volatility of our stock price 
our quarterly revenues  operating results and profitability have varied in the past and are likely to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
this may lead to volatility in our stock price 
the factors that are likely to cause these variations are the rate at which we obtain new outsourcing engagements since our outsourcing engagements often require substantial implementation costs that are recovered over the term of the engagements  seasonality of certain services  including annual benefit enrollment processes  timing of consulting projects and their termination  timing of commencement of new outsourcing engagements  changes in estimates of profitability of outsourcing engagements  the introduction of new products or services by us or our competitors  pricing pressure on new client services and renewals  the timing  success and costs of sales  marketing and product development programs  the success of strategic acquisitions  alliances or investments  changes in estimates  accruals and payments of variable compensation to our employees  and general economic factors 
in addition  our operating results in future periods may be below the expectations of securities analysts and investors which may materially adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock 
there are significant limitations on the ability of any person or company to buy hewitt without the approval of the board of directors  which may decrease the price of our class a common stock 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of hewitt more difficult without the approval of our board of directors  including the following our board of directors is classified into three classes  each of which serves for a staggered three year term  a director may be removed by our stockholders only for cause and then only by the affirmative vote of two thirds of the outstanding stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors  only the board of directors or the chairman of the board may call special meetings of our stockholders  our stockholders may take action only at a meeting of the stockholders and not by written consent  our stockholders must comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to the board of directors or to place stockholders proposals on the agenda for consideration at meetings of the stockholders  the board of directors may consider the impact of any proposed change of control transaction on constituencies other than the stockholders in determining what is in the best interest of hewitt  business combinations involving one or more persons that own or intend to own at least of the voting stock must be approved by the affirmative vote of holders of at least of the voting stock  unless the consideration paid in the business combination is generally the highest price paid by these persons to acquire the voting stock or a majority of the directors unaffiliated with these persons who were directors prior to the time these persons acquired their shares approve the transaction  and the stockholders may amend or repeal the provisions of the certificate of incorporation and the by laws regarding change of control transactions and business combinations only by a vote of holders of two thirds of the outstanding common stock at that time 
section of the delaware general corporation law may delay  defer or prevent a change in control that our stockholders might consider to be in their best interest 
we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law which  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits certain business combinations between a delaware corporation and an interested stockholder generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of or more of a delaware corporation s voting stock for a three year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder 
section could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control that the stockholders might consider to be in their best interest

management considers such factors as the probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss and records a provision with respect to a claim  suit  investigation or proceeding when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
if the reasonable estimate of a probable loss is a range  and no amount within the range is a better estimate  the minimum amount in the range is accrued 
if a loss is not probable or a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated  no liability is recorded 
the company is in active discussions with a number of hr bpo clients to renegotiate the terms of their contracts 
through september   the company has recorded a million contingent liability related to an ongoing dispute with one of these clients 
the company does not believe that any unresolved disputes will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operation

certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
overview fiscal was a year of transition 
during the year  we began to focus on re centering the business in order to capitalize on the growth and margin opportunities that exist in our more established benefits outsourcing and consulting businesses 
we also introduced four key strategic priorities that will help us achieve our objectives 
these priorities have been identified as fundamental to our future success and ongoing health of our business 
following is a brief discussion of these four priorities and the progress made during the year against these priorities 
keep clients first 
our intense focus on the needs of our clients has earned us the strong reputation that we enjoy in the marketplace  and will be key to our future growth and success 
this includes understanding what creates the most value for our clients and also meeting the expectations of our clients 
reinvesting in quality by re engineering our processes  improving our product service delivery and increasing our resourcing levels in some key areas will be underlying themes in our go forward strategies 
in addition  our recently created client and market leadership organization is dedicated to ensuring that we remain focused on driving the right solutions for our clients across the full array of our service offerings 
create a rewarding work experience 
engaged employees are critical to our success 
we are focused on revitalizing our culture and creating a rewarding work environment for our associates around the world 
during the year we appointed a new senior vice president of human resources  who has begun to partner with our other senior leaders to create a truly high performance organization 
grow with intention 
we believe benefits outsourcing and consulting hold opportunities for growth for the foreseeable future 
we continue to pursue new growth strategies  particularly in leveraging our benefits outsourcing and consulting businesses as we focus on re centering the business 
additionally  increased discipline is being exercised in allocating the use of our capital when evaluating these growth opportunities 
we are also seeking to evolve and expand our offers by organic growth and through acquisitions 
in keeping with this priority  we announced during the fiscal fourth quarter the acquisition of reallife hr 
reallife hr oversees health and welfare benefits for companies  each of which has fewer than  employees and retirees 
we believe the middle market represents a large growth opportunity for us and through this acquisition we will be more able to more effectively serve middle market companies 
get lean 
our objectives are to reshape our operating model to improve efficiency and create the fuel to invest in our future growth 
maintaining aggressive focus on our cost structure will continue to be a top priority 
during the year we implemented several productivity initiatives across our business 
in conjunction with an ongoing review of our real estate portfolio  we also announced in the third quarter our intention to consolidate facilities  and in some cases  exit certain properties 
we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter related to this real estate restructuring 
there were a number of specific items that negatively impacted results in fiscal  including non cash pre tax charges of million related to impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and contract loss provisions  a pre tax severance charge of million resulting from ongoing productivity initiatives across the business  a pre tax charge of million related to the review of our real estate portfolio including million of expenses for recognition of the fair value of lease vacancy obligations and lease termination charges related to exit of certain locations and million for related acceleration of depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and other charges  a pre tax charge of million related to the anticipated restructuring of an hr bpo contract  and a pre tax charge of million resulting from the second quarter resolution of a legal dispute with a vendor 
fiscal also included a pre tax non operating gain of million related to the sale of an investment 

table of contents the non cash pre tax charges of million related to impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and contract loss provisions were as follows during the fourth quarter  we performed our annual impairment review of goodwill 
this review resulted in the impairment of million of goodwill in the hr bpo segment due to reduced growth expectations for the overall business  partially due to a revised strategy 
the reduced growth expectations were driven by a reduction in the likely number of future engagements and reduced contract value of each engagement  as we focus on identifying potential customers seeking a more standardized set of platforms and services 
the million non cash charge is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within the goodwill and asset impairment caption 
a non cash charge of million for the impairment of intangibles assets and capitalized software primarily resulted from lower than expected utilization of certain acquired software assets  and is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations within the goodwill and asset impairment caption 
loss provisions of million reflecting our revised profitability expectations for certain european benefits outsourcing contracts 
during the fourth quarter  we undertook an in depth review of profitability of contracts related to the european benefits outsourcing business 
this review established that some of the existing multi year contracts are no longer expected to achieve the levels of profitability previously anticipated and resulted in the need for additional loss provisions 
of this charge  million is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations as a component of compensation and related expenses and million within goodwill and asset impairment 
finally  as discussed in the second quarter  we made changes to our reportable segments and the costs that are delivered to them as we continue to strive for increased transparency into our results 
the changes include the realignment of cost structures and allocation of costs 
improved data and analytical capabilities have provided us with increased visibility into shared service costs that were previously not attributable to specific business segment activity 
as a result  we have been able to quantify and distribute previously unallocated shared service costs to the appropriate business segment 
these costs include charges associated with management  finance  general counsel and corporate relations as well as insurance and other taxes 
further  we are now allocating costs based on usage and consumption factors 
the realignment has impacted the costs reported within each segment and the level of unallocated shared service costs 
these enhancements will provide greater visibility to controllable costs further enhancing our ability to analyze the profitability of each business segment 
reporting of benefits outsourcing and hr bpo 
the hr bpo business has become an increasingly important focus for management 
management has realigned organizational resources in a way that focuses specific resources to the hr bpo and benefits outsourcing businesses 
in addition  improved data and analytical tools have enhanced our ability to identify consumption drivers between each distinct business segment and provide additional insight into business profitability 
as a result of these changes  effective the second quarter of this fiscal year  we began reporting outsourcing as two business segments benefits outsourcing and hr bpo 
for further discussion of how these items impacted our results across the company  please see our discussion of consolidated and segment results below 

table of contents consolidated results the following table sets forth our historical results of operations 
year ended september  of net revenues in thousands change revenues revenues before reimbursements net revenues reimbursements total revenues operating expenses compensation and related expenses goodwill and asset impairment reimbursable expenses other operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses total operating expenses operating loss other income expense  net loss before income taxes provision for income taxes net loss net revenues include  and  of third party supplier revenues for the year ended september  and  respectively 
the third party supplier arrangements are generally marginally profitable 
the related third party supplier expenses are included in operating expenses 
net revenues the increase in net revenues was primarily driven by revenue growth in the consulting segment 
revenue strength was attributed to an increased demand in consulting for retirement and financial management and talent and organizational consulting services 
hr bpo also contributed to the revenue growth due to an increase in the number of clients who went live with contract services over the last twelve months and growth in revenue from existing clients including an increase in project work 
net revenues  excluding third party supplier revenues and the favorable effects of foreign currency translation and acquisitions of approximately million and million  respectively  increased as compared to the prior year 
segment results are discussed in greater detail later in this section 
compensation and related expenses the increase in expense over the prior year includes million of increased performance based compensation and million of higher salaries and wages partially offset by million of lower share based compensation related to lower ipo restricted stock award expense and an increase to the forfeiture rate 
the increase in performance based compensation reflects an overall increase in the expected payout compared to the prior year due to the improvement in underlying performance results in fiscal the increase in salaries and wages is primarily attributable to increases in compensation  higher labor costs related to servicing live clients  and an increase in severance expense 
partially offsetting the increase in salaries and wages is lower contractor expense due to the company s continued efforts to optimize resources 

table of contents goodwill and asset impairment during the year ended september   the company evaluated certain intangible assets related to the hr bpo and benefits outsourcing segments for impairment 
this review resulted in non cash impairment charges of million including million of goodwill impairment and million of asset impairment  which includes capitalized software and core technology of million  customer relationships of million  and million of anticipated losses on certain contracts 
other operating expenses the decrease in other operating expense is due to a reduction in third party supplier costs of million  offset by million pre tax real estate related charges primarily due to recognition of the fair value of lease vacancy obligations and lease termination charges related to exit of certain locations  and related acceleration of depreciation of leasehold improvements and equipment and other charges 
also offsetting the decrease is an increase in client service delivery charges  net of deferrals  of million primarily related to the increased number of hr bpo clients who are live with ongoing services 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a the increase in sg a expense is primarily due to a million charge associated with the anticipated restructuring of one of our hr bpo contracts and a million charge  recorded within benefits outsourcing  associated with the resolution of a legal dispute with a vendor 
also contributing to the increase is higher amortization of intangible assets resulting from the shortening of the remaining useful life of a customer relationship and higher consulting charges related to the company s assessment of its longer term strategy 
other income expense  net other income increased by million over the prior year due to higher interest income derived from significantly higher average investment balances and rising interest rates yielding higher returns 
in addition  in fiscal we sold an investment that was accounted for using the cost basis method of accounting and recognized a gain of million 
in fiscal we recognized a million gain in connection with a contribution of our german retirement and financial management business in exchange for an increased investment in a german actuarial business 
income tax provision our consolidated effective income tax rate was for the year ended september   as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
we identify items which are not normal and recurring in nature and treat these as discrete events 
the tax effect of discrete items is booked entirely in the period in which the discrete event occurs 
additionally  tax legislation and tax examinations in the jurisdictions in which we do business may change our effective tax rate in future periods 
while such changes cannot be predicted  if they occur  the impact on our tax assets  obligations and liquidity will need to be measured and recognized in the financial statements 
in fiscal a number of significant items including a non deductible goodwill impairment charge  as well as a reduction of deferred tax assets related to certain foreign entities impacted the current year rate 
in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
fin will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  our fiscal year and the provisions of fin will be applied to all tax positions under statement no 
upon initial adoption 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this 
table of contents interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year

the third party supplier arrangements are generally marginally profitable 
the related third party supplier expenses are included in other operating expenses 
net revenues the decrease in net revenues was primarily driven by a significant decline in third party supplier revenues resulting from the termination of an hr bpo client contract in the prior year 
excluding third party supplier revenue  direct revenue grew 
this increase is primarily due to consulting growth in both the talent and organization consulting services in north america as well as the asia pacific regions and benefits consulting particularly in europe 
direct revenues also improved as a result of increased services to existing clients as well as increased one time project work in benefits outsourcing 
net revenues  excluding third party supplier revenues and after adjusting for foreign currency translation losses of approximately million and the net effects of acquisitions and dispositions of approximately million  increased as compared to the prior year period 
compensation and related expenses the increase over prior year primarily relates to million of higher performance based compensation and related incentives than in the prior year  million of higher wages due to headcount and cost of living increases  million incremental stock based compensation expense  including expense related to the fiscal grants of restricted stock and the expensing of stock options under sfas r  as well as million of expense related to anticipated losses on 
table of contents certain hr bpo contracts 
these increases were partially offset by higher levels of deferred contract costs related to the hr bpo segment in the current year 
in connection with our initial public offering on june   we granted approximately million shares of class a restricted stock and restricted stock units to our employees 
compensation and related payroll tax expenses of approximately million were recorded as initial public offering restricted stock award expense from june  through september  the grants fully vested on june  goodwill and asset impairment during the year the company recognized million of impairment charges related to hr bpo 
the non cash charges consisted of million of goodwill impairment  million of asset impairment for certain existing contracts due to higher than expected costs to be incurred over the life of the contracts  million of asset impairment resulting from the termination of a client contract and million of long lived asset impairment primarily due to lower than expected utilization of an acquired asset 
other operating expenses the decrease in other operating expenses is primarily driven by a significant decrease in the third party supplier costs due to a terminated client contract in the prior year 
selling  general and administrative expense sg a as a percentage of net revenues  sg a expenses were consistent period over period 
other income expense  net in fiscal  we recognized a gain of million in connection with a contribution of our german retirement and financial management business in exchange for an increased investment in a german actuarial business 
this gain as well as higher interest income  due to increased operating cash flows  accounted for the majority of the year over year increase 
income tax provision our consolidated effective income tax rate was for the year ended september   as compared to for the comparable prior year period 
we identify items which are not normal and recurring in nature and treat these as discrete events 
the tax effect of discrete items is booked entirely in the period in which the discrete event occurs 
additionally  tax legislation and tax examinations in the jurisdictions in which we do business may change our effective tax rate in future periods 
while such changes cannot be predicted  if they occur  the impact on our tax assets  obligations and liquidity will need to be measured and recognized in the financial statements 
in fiscal a number of significant items including a non deductible goodwill impairment charge  the net impact of reserve activity as well as a reduction of deferred tax assets related to certain foreign entities impacted the current year rate 
in addition  we provided million of additional deferred tax assets associated with acquisitions 
this deferred tax asset was recorded as a reduction to goodwill 

table of contents segment results the following table sets forth unaudited historical segment results for the periods presented 
prior year results have been recast to reflect new allocation methodologies and distribution of additional shared service costs adopted in the second quarter of fiscal year in addition  beginning with the second quarter  the company began reporting three segments benefits outsourcing  hr bpo and consulting

the third party supplier arrangements are generally marginally profitable 
the related third party supplier expenses are included in other operating expenses 

table of contents benefits outsourcing benefits outsourcing net revenue  adjusting for the impact of foreign currency translation of million  essentially was unchanged as compared to the year ended september  an increase in services to new and existing clients  organic growth of existing clients  and an increase in project work  was offset by the impact of lost clients and longer implementation cycles required for some of the company s large  complex clients 
benefits operating income decreased as compared to the prior year 
the current year reflects charges of million related to the real estate restructurings  million related to severance charges  million of additional loss reserves for anticipated losses on certain european contracts  and million resulting from the resolution of a legal dispute with a vendor 
asset impairment charges of million primarily related to the write off of customer relationship intangibles and capitalized software  as well as increased client service delivery expense  also contributed to the decrease in segment income 
partially offsetting the decrease were efficiencies driven by global sourcing and other cost management efforts 
hr bpo hr bpo net revenue  excluding third party revenue and adjusting for the impact of foreign currency translation of million  increased during the year ended september  as compared to the prior year period 
the increase is primarily related to an increase in the number of clients who went live with contract services over the last twelve months and growth in revenue from existing clients including an increase in project work 
hr bpo operating loss increased as compared to the prior year 
the current year results reflect charges of million for goodwill impairment and million for intangible asset impairment relating to the impairment of capitalized software  core technology intangible  and customer relationship intangibles 
the current year also reflects charges of million related to the real estate restructurings  million associated with the anticipated restructuring of a client contract and an increase in severance charges of million 
the prior year results reflected charges of million for goodwill impairment  million for anticipated losses on certain contracts  million net asset impairment as the result of the termination of a client in the first quarter of fiscal and million for impairment of long lived assets 
excluding these fiscal and fiscal charges  the segment loss improved primarily due to the stabilization of the existing client base  as well as overall cost management efforts  offset in part by the impact of new contract implementations and increased intangible asset amortization 
consulting consulting net revenues  adjusting for the favorable effects of foreign currency translation of million and acquisitions of approximately million  increased 
the majority of this growth resulted from increased demand in north america and europe for retirement and financial management consulting  in particular  driven by the new funding legislation in the us and upcoming pension accounting changes 
also contributing to the revenue growth is increased demand for talent and organizational consulting services  particularly in the asia pacific region 
segment income increased as compared to the same prior year period due to revenue growth  partially offset by higher compensation expense driven by increased wages and performance based incentives 
unallocated shared service costs unallocated shared service costs are global expenses that are incurred on behalf of the entire company and are not specific to a business segment 
these costs include finance  legal  management and corporate relations and other related costs 
prior to the second quarter  unallocated shared service costs also included various costs specific to individual business segments 
during the second quarter  the company performed a detailed review of shared service costs and how they are consumed 
the review identified shared service costs that could be attributed to a business segment either directly  by embedding the cost in the business segment  or through assignment of costs based upon usage 
prior period results were adjusted to reflect this change 

table of contents unallocated cost increased primarily due to increased professional services related to the company s strategic initiatives  increased performance based compensation expense  offset by productivity savings resulting from restructuring activities 
fiscal years ended september  and the following table sets forth unaudited historical segment results for the periods presented 
prior year results have been recast to reflect new allocation methodologies and distribution of additional shared service costs adopted in the second quarter of fiscal the company has recast the fiscal results for comparative purposes however  fiscal segment results have not been recast as it was not practical to do so 
as a result  the fiscal segment results do not reflect the new allocation methodologies associated with shared service costs nor the distribution of certain unallocated shared service costs into segment results adopted in the second quarter of fiscal and are not comparable to fiscal year ended september  in thousands change benefits outsourcing segment revenues before reimbursements segment income segment income as a percentage of segment revenues hr bpo segment revenues before reimbursements segment loss segment loss as a percentage of segment revenues consulting segment revenues before reimbursements segment income segment income as a percentage of segment revenues total company segment revenues before reimbursements intersegment revenues revenues before reimbursements net revenues reimbursements total revenues segment income charges not recorded at the segment level initial public offering restricted stock awards unallocated shared service costs operating loss income hr bpo net revenues include  and  of third party supplier revenues for the year ended september  and  respectively 
the third party supplier arrangements are generally marginally profitable 
the related third party supplier expenses are included in other operating expenses 

table of contents benefits outsourcing benefits outsourcing net revenue  adjusting for the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation of million and the effects of acquisitions of approximately million  increased during the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
the growth in revenue was primarily due to an increase in services to new and existing clients and an increase in project work 
fiscal operating income as a percentage of benefits outsourcing net revenues increased as compared to the prior year primarily due to revenue growth  partially offset by increases in compensation and related costs associated with higher performance based compensation and related incentives of million and share based compensation of million related to the fiscal grants of restricted stock awards and the expensing of stock options under sfas r  as well as million of severance expense 
hr bpo hr bpo net revenue  excluding third party revenue and adjusting for the impact of foreign currency translation of million increased during the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
the growth in revenue was primarily due to contracts that went live within the twelve month period  partially offset by a decrease in revenue related to the termination of a client contract in the prior year 
fiscal operating loss as a percentage of hr bpo net revenues increased as a result of the non cash charges of million for goodwill impairment  million for anticipated losses on certain contracts  million net asset impairment as the result of the termination of a client in the first quarter of fiscal and million for impairment of long lived assets 
fiscal also included higher performance based compensation and related incentives of million and share based compensation expense of million related to the fiscal grants of restricted stock awards and the expensing of stock options under sfas r 
fiscal also reflected cost savings from a significant reduction in marginally profitable third party supplier revenue and related expenses 
in addition  the year over year comparison was favorably impacted by a million customer relationship intangible asset impairment recorded in the prior year 
consulting consulting net revenues increased by during the year ended september  as compared to the prior year 
adjusting for foreign currency translation losses of approximately million and the net effects of acquisitions and dispositions of approximately million  consulting net revenues increased 
the majority of the increase was driven by increased demand for benefits consulting due to higher actuarial consulting and pension administration services as well as talent and organization consulting services  particularly compensation consulting  corporate restructuring and change services 
communication consulting services also grew due to increased support for the implementation and ongoing management of outsourcing programs  as well as increased client demand for communications support of their employee benefit plans 
fiscal segment income as a percentage of consulting net revenues decreased due to higher compensation resulting primarily from million of higher performance based compensation and related incentives in the current year as well as million incremental stock based compensation this year related to the fiscal grants of restricted stock awards and the expensing of stock options under sfas r 
these items were partially offset by higher revenues in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates conforming with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and this annual report 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  known facts  current and expected economic conditions and  in some cases  actuarial techniques 
we periodically reevaluate these significant factors and make adjustments when facts and circumstances change  however  actual results may differ from estimates 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include certain aspects of accounting for revenue recognition and client contract loss reserves  deferred contract costs and revenues  performance based compensation  accounts receivable and unbilled work in process  goodwill and other intangible assets  retirement plans and income taxes 

table of contents revenue recognition revenues include fees generated from outsourcing contracts and from consulting services provided to our clients 
outsourcing contract terms typically range from three to five years for benefits contracts and seven to ten years for hr bpo contracts  while consulting arrangements are generally of a short term nature 
in connection with the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we have contracts with multiple elements primarily in our benefits outsourcing and hr bpo segments 
multiple element arrangements are assessed to determine whether they can be separated into more than one unit of accounting 
eitf issue establishes the following criteria  all of which must be met  in order for a deliverable to qualify as a separate unit of accounting the delivered items have value to the client on a stand alone basis there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items if the arrangement includes a general right of return relative to the delivered items  delivery or performance of the undelivered items is considered probable and substantially in the control of the company 
if these criteria are not met  deliverables included in an arrangement are accounted for as a single unit of accounting and revenue is deferred until the period in which the final deliverable is provided or a predominant service level has been attained 
if there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for all units of accounting in an arrangement  the arrangement consideration is allocated to the separate units of accounting based on each unit s relative fair value 
revenue is then recognized using a proportional performance method such as recognizing revenue based on transactional services delivered or on a straight line basis as adjusted primarily for volume changes  as appropriate 
our clients typically pay for consulting services either on a time and material or on a fixed fee basis 
on fixed fee engagements  revenues are recognized either as services are provided using a proportional performance method  which utilizes estimates of overall profitability and stages of project completion  or at the completion of the project  based on the facts and circumstances of the client arrangement 
contract losses on outsourcing or consulting arrangements are recognized in the period in which the loss becomes probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
contract losses are determined to be the amount by which the estimated direct costs  including any remaining deferred contract costs  exceed the estimated total revenues that will be generated by the contract 
when a loss is identified  it is first recorded as an impairment of deferred contract costs related to the specific contract  if applicable  with the remaining amount recorded as a loss reserve 
estimates are monitored during the term of the contract and any changes to the estimates are recorded in the period the change is identified and may result in either an additional increase or decrease to the loss reserve 
deferred contract costs and deferred contract revenues for long term outsourcing service agreements  implementation efforts are often necessary to set up clients and their human resource or benefit programs on the company s systems and operating processes 
for outsourcing services sold separately or accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  specific  incremental and direct costs of implementation incurred prior to the services going live are deferred and amortized over the period the related ongoing services revenue is recognized 
such costs may include internal and external costs for coding or creating customizations of systems  costs for conversion of client data and costs to negotiate contract terms 
for outsourcing services that are accounted for as a combined unit of accounting  specific  incremental and direct costs of implementation  as well as ongoing service delivery costs incurred prior to revenue recognition commencing are deferred and amortized over the remaining contract services period 
implementation fees are also generally received from our clients either up front or over the ongoing services period in the fee per participant 
lump sum implementation fees received from a client are initially deferred and then recognized as revenue evenly over the contract ongoing services period 
if a client terminates an outsourcing services arrangement prior to the end of the contract  a loss on the contract may be recorded if necessary and any remaining deferred implementation revenues and costs would then be recognized into earnings through the termination date 

table of contents performance based compensation our compensation program includes a performance based component that is determined by management subject to annual review by the compensation and leadership committee of the board of directors 
performance based compensation is discretionary and is based on individual  team  and total company performance 
performance based compensation is paid once per fiscal year after our annual operating results are finalized 
the amount of expense for performance based compensation recognized at interim reporting dates involves judgment  is based on quarterly and annual results as compared to internal targets  and takes into account other factors  including industry trends and the general economic environment 
annual performance based compensation levels may vary from current expectations as a result of changes in the actual performance of the company  team or individual 
as such  accrued amounts are subject to change in future periods if actual future performance varies from performance levels anticipated in prior interim periods 
client receivables and unbilled work in process we periodically evaluate the collectibility of our client receivables and unbilled work in process based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific client s difficulty in meeting its financial obligations to us eg  bankruptcy  failure to pay amounts due to us or to others  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the client receivable or unbilled work in process to what we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other clients  we recognize an allowance for doubtful accounts based on past write off history and the length of time the receivables are past due or unbilled work in process is not billed 
facts and circumstances may change  which would require us to alter our estimates of the collectibility of client receivables and unbilled work in process 
a key factor mitigating this risk is our diverse client base 
for the years ended september   and  no single client accounted for more than of our total revenues 
goodwill and other intangible assets in applying the purchase method of accounting for business combinations  amounts assigned to identifiable assets and liabilities acquired have been based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisitions  with the remainder recorded as goodwill 
estimates of fair value have been based primarily upon future cash flow projections for the acquired businesses and net assets  discounted to present value using a risk adjusted discount rate 
we evaluate our goodwill for impairment annually and whenever indicators of impairment exist 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities for that reporting unit 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based upon discounted future cash flow projections for the reporting unit 
our estimate of future cash flows is based on our experience  knowledge and typically third party advice or market data 
however  these estimates can be affected by other factors and economic conditions that can be difficult to predict 
intangible assets are initially valued at fair market value using generally accepted valuation methods appropriate for the type of intangible asset 
intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment if indicators of impairment arise 
the evaluation of impairment is based upon a comparison of the carrying amount of the intangible asset to the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset  the asset is considered impaired 
the impairment expense is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of the intangible asset to its carrying value  with any shortfall from fair value recognized as an expense in the current period 
retirement plans we provide pension benefits to certain of our employees outside of north america and other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees in north america 
the valuation of the funded status and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using actuarial assumptions  which are reviewed annually 
the assumptions include rates of increases in employee compensation  interest rates used to discount liabilities  the long term rate of return on plan assets  anticipated future health care costs  and other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement  mortality and turnover 
the selection of assumptions is 
table of contents based on both short term and long term historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of the valuation 
the use of different assumptions would have resulted in different measures of the funded status and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit expenses 
actual results in the future could differ from expected results 
we are not able to estimate the probability of actual results differing from expected results  but believe our assumptions are appropriate 
our assumptions are listed in note the most critical assumptions pertain to the plans covering employees outside north america  as these plans are the most significant to our consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
to the extent that the final tax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded  such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance will not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on our income tax provisions and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
share based compensation our employees and directors may receive awards of nonqualified stock options  stock appreciation rights  restricted stock  restricted stock units  performance shares  performance units  and cash based awards  and employees can also receive incentive stock options 
restricted stock awards  including restricted stock and restricted stock units  are measured using the fair market value of the stock as of the grant date 
the company recognizes compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures on a straight line basis annually over the vesting period 
estimated forfeitures are reviewed periodically and changes to the estimated forfeitures are adjusted through current period earnings 
employer payroll taxes are also recorded as expense when they become due over the vesting period 
the remaining unvested shares are subject to forfeiture and restrictions on sale or transfer  generally for four years from the grant date 
the company also grants nonqualified stock options at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the company s stock on the grant date 
the company applies the black scholes valuation method to compute the estimated fair value of the stock options and recognizes compensation expense  net of estimated forfeitures on a straight line basis so that the award is fully expensed at the vesting date 
generally  stock options vest percent on each anniversary of the grant date  are fully vested four years from the grant date  and have a term of ten years
