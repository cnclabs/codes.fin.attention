our mission is to improve the quality of patient care and the productivity of healthcare delivery through the development and advocacy of less invasive medical devices and procedures 
this mission is accomplished through the continuing refinement of existing products and procedures and the investigation and development of new technologies that can reduce risk  trauma  cost  procedure time and the need for aftercare 
our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances 
our quality policy  applicable to all employees  is i improve the quality of patient care and all things boston scientific 
our management s discussion and analysis md a begins with an overview of the guidant acquisition  which represents a transforming event for boston scientific 
it then provides an executive summary that outlines our financial highlights during and identifies some key trends that impacted operating results during the year 
we supplement this summary with an in depth look at the major issues we believe are most relevant to our current and future prospects 
next is an examination of the material changes in our operating results for as compared to and our operating results for as compared to the discussion then provides an examination of liquidity  focusing primarily on material changes in our operating  investing and financing cash flows  as depicted in our consolidated statements of cash flows  and the trends underlying these changes 
finally  the md a provides information on our critical accounting policies 
guidant acquisition and abbott transaction on april   we consummated our acquisition of guidant corporation for an aggregate purchase price of billion  which represented a combination of cash  common stock and fully vested stock options 
the purchase price net of cash acquired was approximately billion 
in conjunction with the acquisition  we acquired approximately billion of cash  including billion in connection with guidant s prior sale of its vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses to abbott laboratories 
with this acquisition  we have become a major provider in the more than billion global cardiac rhythm management crm business  enhancing our overall competitive position and long term growth potential and further diversifying our product portfolio 
the acquisition has established us as one of the world s largest cardiovascular device companies and a global leader in microelectronic therapeutics 
guidant makes a variety of implantable devices that can monitor the heart and deliver electricity to treat cardiac abnormalities  including tachycardia  heart failure and bradycardia 
these devices include implantable cardioverter defibrillator systems icds and pacemaker systems 
in addition  guidant also makes cardiac surgery systems to perform cardiac surgical ablation  endoscopic vessel harvesting and clampless beating heart bypass surgery 
prior to our acquisition of guidant  abbott acquired guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and agreed to share the drug eluting technology it acquired from guidant with boston scientific 
this agreement gives us access to a second drug eluting stent program  which will complement our existing taxus stent system program

consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for further details on the transaction 
we consolidated guidant s operating results with those of boston scientific beginning on the date of the acquisition  april  since we have not restated our results retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of guidant  fluctuations in our operating results for are due primarily to the acquisition of guidant 
however  we have included supplemental pro forma financial information in note d business combinations to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k to give effect to the acquisition as though it had occurred at the beginning of and executive summary our net sales in increased to billion from billion in our reported net loss for was billion  or per diluted share  on approximately billion weighted average shares outstanding as compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  on approximately million weighted average shares outstanding in our reported results included net after tax charges primarily related to the acquisition of guidant of billion  or per diluted share  in as compared to net after tax charges of million  or per diluted share  in in addition  our cash provided by operating activities was billion in as compared to million in the growth in net sales resulted largely from our acquisition of guidant  which accounted for sales of billion 
the geographic mix of guidant sales included billion of us and million of international sales 
the business mix of guidant sales consisted of billion of crm net sales and million of cardiac surgery net sales 
our crm net sales were comprised of million of icds and million of pacemaker systems 
on a pro forma basis  assuming a full year of results  crm sales were billion in as compared to billion in the decline  on a pro forma basis  was a result of lower average market shares for the guidant devices in relative to we believe the lower market share  as well as reduced market growth rates  was due primarily to previous field actions in the industry 
however  during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a percent sequential increase in net sales from our crm business and a percent increase for us icd sales  which we believe is a sign that our market share has increased and the crm market is stabilizing and will return to growth 
we remain focused on our share recovery 
the increase in our sales as a result of the acquisition of guidant was partially offset by a decrease in taxus stent system sales to billion in from billion in the geographic mix of taxus stent system sales in included billion of us and million of international sales 
in  we had billion of us and million of international sales 
the decline in taxus sales during was attributable to a decrease in the us market size due to recent uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug eluting stents and a decline in the net after tax charges consisted of billion in expenses resulting from purchase accounting associated primarily with purchased research and development obtained as part of the guidant acquisition and the step up value of acquired guidant inventory sold  million in acquisition related costs  including the fair value adjustment related to the sharing of proceeds feature of the abbott stock purchase  a crm technology offering charge and other business integration costs  a million credit resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the abdominal aortic aneurysm aaa program that we obtained as part of the trivascular  inc acquisition  million in write downs attributable to our investment portfolio  and a million one time tax benefit for the reversal of tax accruals previously established for offshore unremitted earnings 
the net after tax charges consisted of a million litigation settlement with medinol ltd 
and million in purchased research and development attributable primarily to our acquisitions

exiting  the percentage of drug eluting stents used in us interventional procedures were in the high percent range  as compared to us drug eluting stent market penetration rates in the low percent range exiting our us drug eluting stent market share declined throughout the first three quarters of  but has been stable during and we have maintained our market leadership position 
we expect to launch our taxus express stent system in the japan market  which we believe exceeds million  in the second half of and our taxus libert stent system in the us  subject to regulatory approvals 
during  our worldwide endosurgery group sales increased to billion from billion in  an increase of percent 
further  our neuromodulation division  formed following the june acquisition of advanced bionics corporation  generated million in net sales during as compared to million in  an increase of percent 
our gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  declined from percent in to percent in largely as a result of certain one time purchase accounting adjustments associated with the guidant acquisition 
in addition  our gross profit declined by approximately percentage points due to period expenses  including costs associated with project horizon  a corporate wide cross functional initiative to improve and harmonize our overall quality processes and systems 
our gross profit also declined by percentage points due to shifts in our product sales mix toward lower margin products  including crm products and lower sales of taxus stents in the us our operating expenses  excluding purchased research and development and litigation related charges  increased billion to billion in from billion in of this increase  billion related to operating expenses associated with the guidant business 
in the second half of  we maintained existing spending levels given our expectation that the crm market and the drug eluting stent market will recover over time and this infrastructure will be necessary to support future growth 
in addition  we announced our plan to reallocate certain crm resources  including those in the research and development and sales and marketing functions  to increase innovation  productivity and competitiveness  and to enhance our ability to deliver new products to physicians and their patients 
this plan resulted in a reduction of our crm workforce by approximately to employees during the first quarter of we intend to reinvest the bulk of the savings from the plan back into the crm business to create a strong  competitive pipeline that will help grow revenue that  combined with expense controls  should lead to increased profitability 
the reinvestment will include additional hiring within the research and development function where there were shortages of desired skills 
we continue to be focused on examining our operations in order to identify cost improvement measures and reallocate resources to support growth initiatives 
at december   we had total outstanding debt of billion  related primarily to the guidant acquisition  cash of billion and working capital of billion 
we continued to generate strong operating cash flow during we expect to use a portion of our operating cash flow to reduce our outstanding debt obligations over the next several years  our first upcoming debt maturity is in april for million

fda warning letters on january   legacy boston scientific received a corporate warning letter from the fda  notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities and advising us that our corrective action plan relating to three site specific warning letters issued to us in was inadequate 
as stated in this fda warning letter  the fda may not grant our requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve pre market approval pma applications for class iii devices to which the quality control or current good manufacturing practices deficiencies described in the letter are reasonably related until the deficiencies have been corrected 
during  in order to strengthen our corporate wide quality controls  we launched project horizon  a corporate wide cross functional initiative to improve and harmonize our overall quality processes and systems 
as part of project horizon  we have made modifications to our process validation and complaint management systems 
project horizon has resulted in the reallocation of significant internal engineering and management resources to quality initiatives  as well as incremental spending 
it also has resulted in adjustments to product launch schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain other product lines over time 
in  our board of directors created a compliance and quality committee to monitor our compliance and quality initiatives 
we believe we have identified solutions to the quality issues cited by the fda  and we continue to make progress in transitioning our organization to implement those solutions 
we communicate frequently and meet regularly with the fda to apprise them of our progress 
the fda has communicated the need for us to complete substantially all remediation efforts before they will reinspect our facilities 
we have engaged a third party to audit our enhanced quality systems in order to assess our corporate wide compliance prior to reinspection by the fda 
we believe we will be ready for the third party audit in the second quarter of on december   guidant received an fda warning letter citing certain deficiencies with respect to its manufacturing quality systems and record keeping procedures in its crm facility in st 
paul  minnesota 
this fda warning letter followed an inspection by the fda that was completed on september  and cited a number of observations 
guidant received a follow up letter from the fda dated january  as stated in this follow up letter  until we have corrected the identified deficiencies  the fda may not grant requests for exportation certificates to foreign governments or approve pma applications for class iii devices to which the deficiencies described are reasonably related 
the fda conducted a further inspection of the crm facility between december  and february  and made one additional inspectional observation 
the fda has concluded its reinspection of our crm facilities 
while we believe this reinspection went well  we may be required to take additional actions in order to comply with any fda observations that we may receive 
outlook guidant acquisition on april   we consummated our acquisition of guidant 
with this acquisition  we have become a major provider in the more than billion global crm business  enhancing our overall competitive position and long term growth potential and further diversifying our product portfolio 
the acquisition has established us as one of the world s largest cardiovascular device companies and a global leader in microelectronic therapeutics 
the integration of guidant s operations and product lines with boston scientific s is complex and time consuming  and the separation of the guidant businesses required by the abbott transaction adds complexity to the transition process 
we have entered transition services agreements with abbott  under which abbott and boston scientific provide or make available to each other certain services  rights  properties and assets for a temporary period 
many of these transition services agreements expire during the failure to integrate boston scientific and guidant successfully and to manage the challenges presented by the transition process effectively  including the retention of key guidant personnel and the 
table of contents 
timely execution of activities under the transition services agreement  may reduce the anticipated potential benefits of the acquisition 
during  we will continue to incur integration and restructuring costs as we integrate certain operations of guidant 
in january  we announced our plan to reallocate certain crm resources  including those in research and development as well as sales and marketing functions  to increase innovation  productivity and competitiveness  and to enhance our ability to deliver new products to physicians and their patients 
this plan resulted in a reduction of our crm workforce by approximately to employees during the first quarter of there can be no assurances that we will realize efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses sufficient to offset incremental transaction  acquisition related  integration and restructuring costs over time 
net sales from our crm and cardiac surgery businesses were billion for  including billion of crm sales and million of cardiac surgery sales 
on a pro forma basis  assuming a full year of results  crm sales were billion in as compared to billion in the decline  on a pro forma basis  was a result of lower average market shares for the guidant devices in relative to we believe the lower market share  as well as reduced market growth rates  was due primarily to previous field actions in the industry 
these field actions included guidant s decision announced on june  to stop selling guidant s leading defibrillator systems temporarily  which were returned to the market beginning on august  in addition  on june   we announced that we were retrieving a specific subset of pacemakers  cardiac resynchronization therapy pacemakers and icds due to a supplier s low voltage capacitor not performing consistently 
we believe that these field actions contributed to our crm division having a lower market share for icds and pacemaker systems for as compared to the worldwide crm market growth rates  including the us defibrillator market  declined during the first three quarters of  these growth levels are below those experienced in recent years 
the us defibrillator market represents approximately half of the worldwide crm market 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a percent sequential increase in net sales from our crm business and a percent increase for us icd sales  which we believe is a sign that our market share has increased and the crm market is stabilizing and will return to growth 
we expect that growth rates in the worldwide crm market  and the us icd market  will recover over several years 
however  there can be no assurance that these markets will return to their historical growth rates or that we will be able to regain crm market share or increase net sales in a timely manner  if at all 
the most significant variables that may impact the size of the crm market and our position within this market include future product recalls or new physician advisories by us or our competitors  our ability to resolve the issues identified in the crm warning letter to the satisfaction of the fda  variations in clinical results  reliability or product performance of our and our competitors products  our ability to retain our sales force and other key personnel  our ability to reestablish the trust and confidence of the implanting community  the referring community and prospective patients in our technology  delayed or limited regulatory approvals  
table of contents 
our ability to launch next generation products and technology features in a timely manner  if at all  international economic and regulatory conditions  new competitive launches  unfavorable reimbursement policies  declines in average selling prices  the overall number of procedures performed  and the outcome of legal proceedings related to our crm business 
we remain focused on our market share recovery and intend to accelerate recovery by regaining the trust and confidence of the implanting community  the referring community and prospective patients  continuing to improve our quality systems  investing in new technologies and clinical trials  retaining our sales force and other key personnel  continuing research and development productivity  and improving physician and patient communication 
however  if these efforts are not successful  and the crm market does not recover according to our expectations  or we are unable to regain market share and net sales on a timely basis  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
coronary stent business coronary stent revenue represented approximately percent of our consolidated net sales for  as compared to percent in  primarily as a result of the guidant acquisition 
we estimate that the worldwide coronary stent market approximated billion in  and estimate that drug eluting stents represented approximately percent of the dollar value of the worldwide coronary stent market in the us drug eluting stent market for approximated billion 
our us taxus sales declined to billion for as compared to billion for recent uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug eluting stents contributed to a decline in the us stent market size 
in addition to the decline in us drug eluting stent market penetration  device utilization per procedure and overall percutaneous coronary intervention volume has decreased likely due to market conservatism 
we believe this conservatism is a temporary circumstance that  if alleviated  may lead to an increase in future procedural volume and usage of drug eluting stents 
in the fourth quarter of  the fda held a special advisory panel meeting to discuss drug eluting stents 
members of the panel concluded that drug eluting stents remain safe and effective when used as indicated  and that the benefits outweigh the risks 
we believe that percutaneous coronary interventions  device utilization per procedure and drug eluting stent penetration rates will increase in the future  and result in a market recovery  however  there can be no assurance that this will happen or that the market will recover to previous levels 
we expect that our us drug eluting stent sales in may be below those experienced in during  our international taxus stent system net sales remained consistent with drug eluting stent penetration rates increased during the first half of  and remained relatively flat throughout the second half of and exiting  the effect of which offset declines in our market share associated with several competitive launches of new drug eluting stent products in our europe and inter continental markets 
we expect competitive launches in these geographies to continue to put pressure on our market share and average selling prices in in addition  we expect that drug eluting stent penetration rates will remain relatively consistent in our europe and inter continental markets during due primarily to concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis 
subject to regulatory

approval  we expect to launch our taxus express stent system in japan during the second half of  where we estimate a drug eluting stent market size exceeding million 
historically  the worldwide coronary stent market has been dynamic and highly competitive with significant market share volatility 
in addition  in the ordinary course of our business  we conduct and participate in numerous clinical trials with a variety of study designs  patient populations and trial end points 
unfavorable or inconsistent clinical data from existing or future clinical trials conducted by us  by our competitors or by third parties  or the market s perception of this clinical data  may adversely impact our position in and share of the drug eluting stent market and may contribute to increased volatility in the market 
however  we believe that we can maintain a leadership position within the drug eluting stent markets in which we compete for a variety of reasons  including the results of our taxus clinical trials  the performance benefits of our current technology  the strength of our pipeline of drug eluting stent products and the planned launch sequence of these products  our overall market leadership in interventional medicine and our sizeable interventional cardiology sales force  our significant investments in our sales  clinical  marketing and manufacturing capabilities  and our second drug eluting stent platform obtained as a result of our guidant acquisition 
however  a material decline in our drug eluting stent revenue would have a significant adverse impact on our future operating results 
the most significant variables that may impact the size of the drug eluting coronary stent market and our position within this market include continued concerns regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis  the entry of additional competitors in international markets and the us  continued physician and patient confidence in our technology and attitudes toward drug eluting stents  our ability to resolve the issues identified in the current legacy boston scientific corporate warning letter to the satisfaction of the fda  declines in the average selling prices of drug eluting stent systems  variations in clinical results or product performance of our and our competitors products  delayed or limited regulatory approvals  the overall number of procedures performed  unfavorable reimbursement policies  
table of contents 
intellectual property litigation  the average number of stents used per procedure  our ability to maintain and expand indications for use  our ability to launch next generation products and technology features  the international adoption rate of drug eluting stent technology  international economic and regulatory conditions  and the level of supply of our drug eluting stent systems and competitive stent systems 
the taxus drug eluting stent system is currently one of only two drug eluting products in the us market 
our share of the drug eluting stent market  as well as unit prices  may be adversely impacted as additional significant competitors enter the drug eluting stent market  which could occur as early as the second half of in the us prior to our acquisition of guidant  abbott acquired guidant s vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses and agreed to share the drug eluting technology it acquired from guidant with boston scientific  including the xience v everolimus eluting coronary stent system 
in october of  we received ce mark approval to begin marketing the promus stent system  which is a private labeled xience v drug eluting coronary stent system supplied to us by abbott 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a limited launch of the promus stent system in certain european countries 
we expect to launch the promus stent system in certain inter continental countries in the second quarter of and in the us in  subject to regulatory approval 
under the terms of our supply arrangement with abbott  the profit margin of a promus stent system will be significantly lower than our taxus drug eluting stent 
therefore  the mix of promus stent system revenue relative to our total drug eluting stent revenue could have a negative impact on our overall profitability as a percentage of revenue 
in addition  we will incur incremental costs and expend incremental resources in order to develop and commercialize products utilizing the guidant drug eluting stent system technology and to support the launch of our internally manufactured everolimus eluting stent system in the future  which we expect will have profit margins more comparable to our taxus stent system 
regulatory compliance in january  legacy boston scientific received a corporate warning letter from the fda  notifying us of serious regulatory problems at three facilities 
during  in order to strengthen our corporate wide quality controls  we launched project horizon  which has resulted in the reallocation of significant internal engineering and management resources to quality initiatives  as well as incremental spending 
it also has resulted in adjustments to product launch schedules of certain products and the decision to discontinue certain other product lines over time 
see the fda warning letters section above for further information regarding the fda warning letters 
there can be no assurances regarding the length of time or cost it will take us to resolve these issues to the satisfaction of the fda 
our inability to resolve these issues in a timely manner may further delay product launch schedules  including the us launch of our taxus libert stent  which may weaken our competitive position in the markets in which we participate 
if our remedial actions are not satisfactory to the fda  we may have to devote additional financial and human resources to our efforts  and the fda may take further regulatory actions against us  including  but not limited to  seizing our product inventory  
table of contents 
obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of our products  issuing a consent decree or assessing civil monetary penalties 
intellectual property litigation there continues to be significant intellectual property litigation in the coronary stent market 
we are currently involved in a number of legal proceedings with our existing competitors  including johnson johnson and medtronic  inc there can be no assurance that an adverse outcome in one or more of these proceedings would not impact our ability to meet our objectives in the market 
see note j commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a description of these legal proceedings 
innovation our approach to innovation combines internally developed products and technologies with those we obtain externally through our strategic acquisitions and alliances 
our research and development program is largely focused on the development of next generation and novel technology offerings across multiple programs and divisions 
as a result of our agreement with abbott  we now have access to a second drug eluting stent program  which will complement our existing taxus stent system program 
we expect to continue to invest in our paclitaxel drug eluting stent program  along with our internally manufactured everolimus eluting stent program  to continue to sustain our worldwide drug eluting stent market leadership position 
during  we expect to incur incremental capital expenditures and research and development expenses as a result of our dual drug eluting stent program 
we successfully launched our next generation drug eluting stent product  the taxus libert stent system  during in our europe and inter continental markets 
we expect to launch our taxus libert stent system in the us  subject to regulatory approval 
in addition  we expect to continue to invest in our crm technologies  including our latitude patient management system  which is technology that enables physicians to monitor device performance remotely while patients remain in their homes  and the frontier crm technology  our next generation pulse generator platform 
in october  the fda approved expansion of our latitude system to be used for remote monitoring in certain existing icds and cardiac resynchronization defibrillators 
we also expect to invest selectively in areas outside of drug eluting stent and crm technologies 
there can be no assurance that these technologies will achieve technological feasibility  obtain regulatory approval or gain market acceptance 
a delay in the development or approval of these technologies may adversely impact our future growth 
our acquisitions and alliances are intended to expand further our ability to offer our customers effective  high quality medical devices that satisfy their interventional needs 
management believes it has developed a sound plan to integrate acquired businesses 
however  our failure to integrate these businesses successfully could impair our ability to realize the strategic and financial objectives of these transactions 
potential future acquisitions  including companies with whom we currently have strategic alliances or options to purchase  or the fulfillment of our contingent consideration obligations may be dilutive to our earnings and may require additional debt or equity financing  depending on their size and nature 
further  in connection with these acquisitions and other strategic alliances  we have acquired numerous in process research and development projects 
as we continue to undertake strategic growth initiatives  it is reasonable to assume that we will acquire additional in process research and development projects 
in addition  we have entered a significant number of strategic alliances with privately held and publicly traded companies 
many of these alliances involve equity investments and often give us the option to acquire the other company or assets of the other company in the future 
we enter these strategic alliances to broaden our product technology portfolio and to strengthen and expand our reach into existing and new markets 
the success of these alliances is an element of our growth strategy and we will continue to seek 
table of contents 
market opportunities and growth through selective strategic alliances and acquisitions 
however  the full benefit of these alliances is often dependent on the strength of the other companies underlying technology and ability to execute 
an inability to achieve regulatory approvals and launch competitive product offerings  or litigation related to these technologies  among other factors  may prevent us from realizing the benefit of these alliances 
even though we believe that the drug eluting stent market and crm market will recover above existing levels  there can be no assurance to the timing or extent of this recovery 
in  we will continue to reprioritize our internal research and development project portfolio and our external investment portfolio primarily based on expectations of future market growth 
this reprioritization may result in our decision to sell  discontinue  write down  or otherwise reduce the funding of certain projects  operations  investments or assets 
any proceeds from sales  or any increases in operating cash flows  resulting from such management actions may be used to reduce debt or may be reinvested in other research and development projects or other operational initiatives 
reimbursement and funding our products are purchased by hospitals  doctors and other healthcare providers who are reimbursed by third party payors  such as governmental programs eg  medicare and medicaid  private insurance plans and managed care programs  for the healthcare services provided to their patients 
third party payors may provide or deny coverage for certain technologies and associated procedures based on assessment criteria as determined by the third party payor 
reimbursement by third party payors for these services is based on a wide range of methodologies that may reflect the services assessed resource costs  clinical outcomes and economic value 
these reimbursement methodologies confer different  and often conflicting  levels of financial risk and incentives to healthcare providers and patients  and these methodologies are subject to frequent refinements 
there is no way of predicting the outcome of reimbursement decisions  or their impact on our operating results 
third party payors are also increasingly adjusting reimbursement rates and challenging the prices charged for medical products and services 
there can be no assurance that our products will be automatically covered by third party payors  that reimbursement will be available or  if available  that the third party payors coverage policies will not adversely affect our ability to sell our products profitably 
international markets international markets are also being affected by economic pressure to contain reimbursement levels and healthcare costs 
our sales growth and profitability from our international operations may be limited by risks and uncertainties related to economic conditions in these regions  currency fluctuations  regulatory and reimbursement approvals  competitive offerings  infrastructure development  rights to intellectual property and our ability to implement our overall business strategy 
any significant changes in the competitive  political  regulatory  reimbursement or economic environment where we conduct international operations may have a material impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  we are required to receive or renew regulatory approvals and obtain exportation certificates to foreign governments in order to market our products in certain international jurisdictions 
these approvals and certificates could be impacted by the fda warning letters we have received 
if these approvals and certificates are not renewed or obtained on a timely basis  our ability to market our full line of existing products within these jurisdictions may be limited  which could have a material adverse impact on our business

us net sales in  our us net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase is related primarily to the inclusion of billion of us net sales from our new crm and cardiac surgery divisions 
in addition  we experienced increases in our us net sales related to sales growth of million from our endosurgery group and million from our neuromodulation division 
offsetting this increase were declines in our us net sales of taxus coronary stent systems to billion for as compared to billion for and sales decreases of approximately million in as compared to due to the expiration during the first quarter of of our agreement to distribute certain third party guidewire and sheath products 
the decline in taxus sales was due principally to a decrease in the us drug eluting stent market size and a decline in average taxus market share in relative to the drug eluting stent market decline was due to recent uncertainty regarding the risk of late stent thrombosis following the use of drug eluting stents  which resulted in conservative usage by physicians 
the overall size of the us drug eluting stent market is driven primarily by the number of percutaneous coronary interventional procedures performed  the number of devices used per procedure  the drug eluting stent penetration rate or mix between bare metal and drug eluting stents across procedures  and average drug eluting stent selling prices 
the primary reason for the decline in the us drug eluting stent market size was lower penetration rates in relative to exiting  the percentage of drug eluting stents used in us interventional procedures were in the high percent range  as compared to us drug eluting stent market penetration rates in the low percent range exiting the drug eluting stent market also declined due to decreases in the number of devices used per procedure and slight reductions in average selling prices 
our drug eluting stent market share declined throughout the first three quarters of  but has been stable during see the outlook section for a more detailed discussion of the drug eluting stent market and our position within that market 
in  our us net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase resulted largely from a full year of taxus stent system sales  which we launched in march us taxus stent system sales for were billion as compared to billion for  offset by a reduction in market share compared to the prior year 
the remainder of the increase in our us net sales related to sales growth of million from our endosurgery group and million from our neuromodulation division 
international net sales in  our international net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase related primarily to the inclusion of million of international net sales from our new crm and cardiac surgery divisions 
the remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to growth in various product franchises  including million in net sales from our endosurgery group and million in sales growth from our neurovascular division 
taxus stent system sales in our europe and inter continental markets were million in as compared to million in taxus stent system sales were favorably impacted by drug eluting stent penetration rates in these markets 
the drug eluting stent penetration rates increased during the first half of  and remained relatively flat throughout the second half of and exiting market share declines associated with several competitors having launched new drug eluting stent products in these markets offset the favorable impact of increased penetration rates 
in  our legacy boston scientific net sales in japan  excluding the impact of currency fluctuations  were relatively consistent with the prior year 
due to the timing of regulatory approval for our taxus stent system and government mandated pricing reductions for other products  we do not expect significant revenue growth in our legacy japan business until we launch our taxus express stent system in japan

which we expect to occur during the second half of japan net sales for included million from crm and cardiac surgery products 
in  our international net sales increased by million  or percent  as compared to the increase related primarily to sales growth of our taxus stent system by million  or percent  in our europe and inter continental markets 
this increase in taxus stent system sales in these markets was primarily the result of increased market penetration rates  as well as the successful launch of our taxus libert stent system during the remainder of the increase in our revenue in these markets was due to growth in various product franchises  including million in incremental sales from our endosurgery group and million in sales growth from our neuromodulation division 
gross profit the following table provides a summary of our gross profit in millions of net sales of net sales of net sales gross profit in  our gross profit  as a percentage of net sales  decreased by percentage points as compared to our gross profit for decreased as a percentage of net sales by percentage points as compared to due to costs associated with guidant  including million in step up value of acquired guidant inventory sold during the period and a million charge associated with making our latitude patient management system available to many of our existing crm patients without additional charge 
in connection with the accounting for the guidant acquisition  we wrote up inventory acquired from manufacturing cost to fair value 
as of december   we had no inventory step up value remaining in inventory 
in addition  our gross profit for decreased as a percentage of net sales by approximately percentage points as compared to due to period expenses  including costs associated with project horizon and certain inventory charges

tax rate the following table provides a summary of our reported tax rate percentage point increase decrease versus versus reported tax rate impact of certain charges in  the decrease in our reported tax rate as compared to related primarily to the impact of certain charges during that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate 
these charges include purchased research and development  asset write downs  reversal of taxes associated with unremitted earnings  and tax gain on the sale of intangible assets 
as of december   we had recorded a million deferred tax liability for unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that we had anticipated repatriating in the foreseeable future 
during  we made a significant acquisition that  when combined with certain changes in business conditions subsequent to the acquisition  resulted in a reevaluation of this liability 
we have determined that we will not repatriate these earnings in the foreseeable future and  instead  we will indefinitely reinvest these earnings in foreign operations to repay debt obligations associated with the acquisition 
as a result  we reversed the deferred tax liability and reduced income tax expense by million in we currently estimate that our effective tax rate  excluding certain charges  will be approximately percent due primarily to our intention to reinvest offshore substantially all of our offshore earnings 
however  acquisitions or dispositions in and geographic changes in the manufacture of our products may positively or negatively impact our effective tax rate 
in  the increase in our reported tax rate as compared to related primarily to the impact of certain charges during that are taxed at different rates than our effective tax rate 
these charges include certain litigation related charges  purchased research and development  asset write downs and employee related costs that resulted from certain business optimization initiatives  costs related to certain retirement benefits  and a tax adjustment associated with a technical correction made to the american jobs creation act 
litigation related charges in  we recorded a million pre tax charge associated with the medinol litigation settlement 
on september   we reached a settlement with medinol resolving certain contract and patent infringement litigation 
in conjunction with the settlement agreement  we paid million in cash and cancelled our equity investment in medinol 
in  we recorded a million provision for certain legal and regulatory matters  which included a civil settlement with the us department of justice  which we paid in see further discussion of our material legal proceedings in item legal proceedings above and note j commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
purchased research and development during  we recorded billion of purchased research and development 
this amount included a charge of approximately billion associated with the purchased research and development obtained 
table of contents 
in conjunction with the guidant acquisition  a credit of approximately million resulting primarily from the reversal of accrued contingent payments due to the cancellation of the trivascular aaa program  and an expense of approximately million resulting primarily from the application of equity method accounting for our investment in endotex interventional systems 
the billion of purchased research and development associated with the guidant acquisition consists primarily of approximately billion for acquired crm related products and approximately million for drug eluting stent technology shared with abbott 
the purchased research and development value associated with the guidant acquisition also includes approximately million that represents the estimated fair value of the potential milestone payments of up to million that we may receive from abbott upon receipt of certain regulatory approvals by the vascular intervention and endovascular solutions businesses it acquired from guidant 
we recorded the amounts as purchased research and development at the acquisition date because the receipt of the payments is dependent on future research and development activity and regulatory approvals  and the asset has no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
the most significant purchased research and development projects acquired from guidant include the frontier crm technology and rights to the everolimus eluting stent technology that we share with abbott 
the frontier crm technology represents guidant s next generation pulse generator platform that will incorporate new components and software while leveraging certain existing intellectual property  technology  manufacturing know how and institutional knowledge of guidant 
we expect to leverage this platform across all crm product lines to treat electrical dysfunction in the heart 
we expect to launch various frontier based products commercially in the us over the next months  subject to regulatory approval 
as of december   we estimate that the total costs to complete the frontier crm technology is between million and million 
we expect material cash inflows from frontier based products to commence in the million attributable to the everolimus eluting stent technology represents the estimated fair value of the rights to guidant s everolimus based drug eluting stent technology we share with abbott 
in december  we launched promus  our first generation everolimus based stent  supplied by abbott  in limited quantities in europe 
we expect to launch a first generation everolimus eluting stent  supplied by abbott  in the us in  subject to regulatory approval 
we expect to launch an internally manufactured next generation everolimus based stent in europe in and in the us in we expect that material net cash inflows net of operating costs  including research and development costs to complete from our internally manufactured everolimus based drug eluting stent will commence in or  following its approval in europe and in the us as of december   we estimate that the cost to complete the next generation everolimus eluting stent technology project is between million and million 
the in process projects acquired in conjunction with the guidant acquisition are generally progressing in line with our estimates as of the acquisition date

our purchased research and development consisted of million relating to our acquisition of trivascular  million relating to our acquisition of advanced stent technologies  inc ast  million relating to our acquisition of rubicon  and million relating to our acquisition of cryovascular systems  inc in addition  we recorded million of purchased research and development in conjunction with obtaining distribution rights for new brain monitoring technology that aspect medical systems  one of our strategic partners  is currently developing 
this technology is designed to aid the diagnosis and treatment of depression  alzheimer s disease and other neurological conditions 
the most significant purchased research and development projects included trivascular s aaa stent graft and ast s petal bifurcation stent  which collectively represented percent of our 
table of contents 
purchased research and development 
during the second quarter of  management cancelled the trivascular aaa stent graft program 
the program cancellation was due principally to forecasted increases in time and costs to complete the development of the stent graft and to receive regulatory approval 
we do not expect the program cancellation and related write downs to impact our future operations or cash flows materially 
the cancellation of the trivascular aaa program resulted in the shutdown of our facility in santa rosa  california and the displacement of approximately employees 
during  we recorded a charge to research and development expenses of approximately million associated primarily with write downs of fixed assets and a charge to research and development expenses of approximately million associated with severance and related costs incurred in connection with the cancellation of the trivascular aaa program 
in addition  we recorded an impairment charge related to the remaining trivascular intangible assets and reversed our accrual for contingent payments recorded in the initial purchase accounting 
the effect of the write off of these assets and liabilities was a million charge to amortization expense and a million credit to purchased research and development during the second quarter of we completed substantially the shutdown activities during the third quarter of ast s petal bifurcation stent is designed to expand into the side vessel where a single vessel branches into two vessels  permitting blood to flow into both branches of the bifurcation and providing support at the junction 
we estimate the remaining cost to complete the petal bifurcation stent to be between million and million 
we expect material net cash inflows from the petal bifurcation stent to begin in  which is when we expect the stent to be commercially available in the us in a drug eluting configuration 
the ast petal bifurcation stent in process project is generally progressing in line with our estimates as of the acquisition date 
in  we recorded million of purchased research and development 
our purchased research and development consisted primarily of million relating to our acquisitions of advanced bionics and million relating to our acquisition of precision vascular systems  inc the most significant in process projects acquired in connection with our acquisitions included advanced bionics bion microstimulator and drug delivery pump  which collectively represented percent of our acquired in process projects value 
the bion microstimulator is an implantable neurostimulation device designed to treat a variety of neurological conditions 
we estimate the remaining cost to complete the bion microstimulator for migraine headaches to be approximately million 
we expect material net cash inflows from the bion microstimulator to commence in  following its approval in the us  which we expect to occur in the advanced bionics drug delivery pump is an implanted programmable device designed to treat chronic pain 
we estimate the remaining cost to complete the drug delivery pump to be between million and million 
we continue to assess the pace and risk of development of the drug delivery pump  as well as general market opportunities for the pump  which may result in a delay in the timing of regulatory approval or lower potential market value 
we currently expect material net cash inflows from the drug delivery pump to commence in  following its approval in the us  which we expect to occur in or the estimated timing and costs to complete the bion microstimulator and the drug delivery pump have increased relative to what we estimated as of the acquisition date  however  we do not believe these increases will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition

in conjunction with the acquisition of endotex  we paid approximately million  which included approximately five million shares of our common stock valued at approximately million and cash of million  in addition to our previous investments and notes issued of approximately million  plus future consideration that is contingent upon endotex achieving certain performance related milestones 
we do not expect significant purchased research and development charges associated with this acquisition because endotex obtained fda approval of its carotid stent system prior to acquisition

equity in march  we filed a new public registration statement with the sec 
during the first quarter of  we increased our authorized common stock from billion shares to billion shares in anticipation of our acquisition of guidant  and issued approximately million shares to former guidant shareholders in conjunction with the acquisition

interest payment amounts related to the billion five year term loan are projected using market interest rates as of december  future interest payments may differ from these projections based on changes in the market interest rates 
certain of our business combinations involve the payment of contingent consideration 
see note d business combinations to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for the estimated maximum potential amount of future contingent consideration we could be required to pay associated with our business combinations 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  the acquired companies will reach their performance milestones or the amount of contingent consideration payable based on future revenues  the maximum contingent consideration has not been included in the table above 
additionally  we may consider satisfying these commitments by issuing our stock or refinancing the commitments with cash  including cash obtained through the sale of our stock 
certain of our equity investments give us the option to acquire the company in the future or may require us to make payments that are contingent upon the company achieving certain product development targets or obtaining regulatory approvals 
since it is not possible to estimate when  or even if  we will exercise our option to acquire these companies or be required to make these contingent payments  we have not included future potential payments relating to these equity investments in the table above 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit and bank guarantees of approximately million  which primarily consisted of financial lines of credit provided by banks and collateral for workers compensation programs 
we enter these letters of credit and bank guarantees in the normal course of business 
as of december   we have not drawn upon the letters of credit or guarantees 
at this time  we do not believe we will be required to fund any amounts from the guarantees or letters of credit and  accordingly  we have not recognized a related liability in our financial statements as of december  our letters of credit and bank guarantees were immaterial at december  critical accounting policies we have adopted accounting policies to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap 
we describe these accounting polices in note a significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap  management makes estimates and assumptions that may affect the reported amounts of our assets and liabilities  the disclosure 
table of contents 
of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of our revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
we consider estimates to be critical if we are required to make assumptions about material matters that are uncertain at the time of estimation or if materially different  estimates could have been made or it is reasonably likely that the accounting estimate will change from period to period 
the following are areas that we consider critical revenue recognition our revenue consists primarily of the sale of single use medical devices 
we consider revenue to be realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally meet these criteria at the time of shipment when the risk of loss and title passes to the customer or distributor  unless a consignment arrangement exists 
we recognize revenue from consignment arrangements based on product usage  or implant  which indicates that the sale is complete 
for all other transactions  we recognize revenue when title to the goods and risk of loss transfer to customers  provided there are no remaining substantive performance obligations required of us or any matters requiring customer acceptance 
for multiple element arrangements  whereby the sale of devices is combined with future service obligations  we defer revenue on the undelivered elements based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value 
we generally allow our customers to return defective  damaged and  in certain cases  expired products for credit 
in addition  we may allow customers to return previously purchased products for next generation product offerings 
we establish a reserve for sales returns when the initial product is sold 
we base our estimate for sales returns upon contractual commitments and historical trends and recorded such amount as a reduction to revenue 
we offer sales rebates and discounts to certain customers 
we treat sales rebates and discounts as a reduction of revenue and classify the corresponding liability as current 
we estimate rebates for products where there is sufficient historical information available to predict the volume of expected future rebates 
if we are unable to estimate the expected rebates reasonably  we record a liability for the maximum rebate percentage offered 
inventory reserves we base our provisions for excess  obsolete or expired inventory primarily on our estimates of forecasted net sales levels 
a significant change in the timing or level of demand for our products as compared to forecasted amounts may result in recording additional provisions for excess or expired inventory in the future 
the industry in which we participate is characterized by rapid product development and frequent new product introductions 
uncertain timing of next generation product approvals  variability in product launch strategies  product recalls and variation in product utilization all impact the estimates related to excess and obsolete inventory 
valuation of business combinations we allocate the amounts we pay for each acquisition to the assets we acquire and liabilities we assume based on their fair values at the dates of acquisition 
we then allocate the purchase price in excess of net tangible assets acquired to identifiable intangible assets  including purchased research and development 

table of contents 
we base the fair value of identifiable intangible assets on detailed valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management 
we allocate any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired to goodwill 
the use of alternative valuation assumptions  including estimated cash flows and discount rates  and alternative estimated useful life assumptions could result in different purchase price allocations  purchased research and development charges  and intangible asset amortization expense in current and future periods 
the valuation of purchased research and development represents the estimated fair value at the dates of acquisition related to in process projects 
our purchased research and development represents the value of in process projects that have not yet reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future uses as of the date of acquisition 
the primary basis for determining the technological feasibility of these projects is obtaining regulatory approval to market the underlying products in an applicable geographic region 
we expense the value attributable to these in process projects at the time of the acquisition 
if the projects are not successful or completed in a timely manner  we may not realize the financial benefits expected for these projects or for the acquisitions as a whole 
in addition  we record certain costs associated with our strategic alliances as purchased research and development 
we use the income approach to determine the fair values of our purchased research and development 
this approach determines fair value by estimating the after tax cash flows attributable to an in process project over its useful life and then discounting these after tax cash flows back to a present value 
we base our revenue assumptions on estimates of relevant market sizes  expected market growth rates  expected trends in technology and expected product introductions by competitors 
in arriving at the value of the in process projects  we consider  among other factors the in process projects stage of completion  the complexity of the work completed as of the acquisition date  the costs already incurred  the projected costs to complete  the contribution of core technologies and other acquired assets  the expected introduction date  and the estimated useful life of the technology 
we base the discount rate used to arrive at a present value as of the date of acquisition on the time value of money and medical technology investment risk factors 
for the in process projects we acquired in connection with our recent acquisitions  we used the following ranges of risk adjusted discount rates to discount our projected cash flows percent to percent in  percent to percent in  and percent to percent in we believe that the estimated purchased research and development amounts so determined represent the fair value at the date of acquisition and do not exceed the amount a third party would pay for the projects 
impairment of intangible assets we review our intangible assets quarterly to determine if any adverse conditions exist or a change in circumstances has occurred that would indicate impairment or a change in their remaining useful life 
in addition  we review our indefinite lived intangible assets at least annually for impairment and reassess their classification as indefinite lived assets 
to test for impairment  we calculate the fair value of our indefinite lived intangible assets and compare the calculated fair values to the respective carrying values 
we test our march goodwill balances during the second quarter of each year for impairment  or more frequently if certain indicators are present or changes in circumstances suggest that impairment may exist 
in performing the test  we calculate the fair value of our reporting units as the present value of estimated future cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate 
the selection and use of an appropriate discount rate requires significant management judgment with respect to revenue and expense growth rates 
we have not recorded impairment of goodwill in any of the years included in our consolidated statements of operations

investments in strategic alliances we account for investments in companies over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence under the equity method if we hold percent or less of the voting stock 
we account for investments in companies over which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence under the cost method 
our determination of whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence over an investment requires judgment 
factors that we consider in determining whether we have the ability to exercise significant influence include  but are not limited to our level of representation on the board of directors  our participation in the investee s policy making processes  transactions with the investee in the ordinary course of business  interchange of managerial personnel  the investee s financial or technological dependency on us  and our ownership in relation to the concentration of other shareholders 
we regularly review our strategic alliance investments for impairment indicators 
if we determine that impairment exists and it is other than temporary  we recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between an investment s carrying value and its fair value 
our exposure to loss related to our strategic alliances is generally limited to our equity investments and notes receivable associated with these alliances 
see note a significant accounting policies and note c investments in strategic alliances to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k for a detailed analysis of our investments and our accounting treatment for our investment portfolio 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method for accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when we expect the differences to reverse 
we recognized net deferred tax liabilities of billion at december  and million at december  the liabilities relate primarily to deferred taxes associated with our acquisitions 
the assets relate primarily to the establishment of inventory and product related reserves  litigation and product liability reserves  purchased research and development  net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
in light of our historical financial performance  we believe we will substantially recover these assets 
we reduce our deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that we will not realize some portion or all of the deferred tax assets

the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in our opinion  we have made adequate provisions for income taxes for all years subject to audit 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  we can make no assurance that the final tax outcome of these matters will not be different from that which we have reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material impact on our income tax provision and operating results in the period in which we make such determination

legal  product liability costs and securities claims we are involved in various legal and regulatory proceedings  including intellectual property  breach of contract  securities litigation and product liability suits 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which if granted  could require significant expenditures or impact our ability to sell our products 
we are substantially self insured with respect to general  product liability and securities claims and record losses for claims in excess of the limits of purchased insurance in earnings at the time and to the extent they are probable and estimable 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies  we accrue anticipated costs of settlement  damages  loss for general product liability claims and  under certain conditions  costs of defense based on historical experience or to the extent specific losses are probable and estimable 
otherwise  we expense these costs as incurred 
if the estimate of a probable loss is a range and no amount within the range is more likely  we accrue the minimum amount of the range 
our accrual for legal matters that are probable and estimable was million at december  and million at december  in connection with our acquisition of guidant  the number of product liability claims and other legal proceedings filed against us  including private securities litigation and shareholder derivative suits  significantly increased 
the amounts accrued at december  represent primarily accrued legal defense costs related to assumed guidant litigation and product liability claims recorded as part of the purchase price 
in connection with the acquisition of guidant  we are still assessing certain assumed litigation and product liability claims to determine the amounts that management believes will be paid as a result of such claims and litigation and  therefore  additional losses may be accrued in the future

stock based compensation on january   we adopted fasb statement no

we adopted statement no

we use the black scholes option pricing model to calculate the grant date fair value of our stock options 
we value restricted stock awards and deferred stock units based on the closing trading value of our shares on the date of grant 
the following represents the assumptions used in calculating our stock based compensation expense that require significant judgment by management expected volatility we have considered a number of factors in estimating volatility 
for options granted prior to  we used our historical volatility as a basis to estimate expected volatility in our valuation of stock options 
we changed our method of estimating volatility upon the adoption of statement no 
r 
we now consider historical volatility  trends in volatility within our industry peer group and implied volatility 
expected term we estimate the expected term of our options using historical exercise and forfeiture data 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of our new option grants

estimated forfeiture rate we have applied  based on an analysis of our historical forfeitures  an annual forfeiture rate of eight percent to all unvested stock awards as of december   which represents the portion that we expect will be forfeited each year over the vesting period 
we will reevaluate this analysis periodically and adjust the forfeiture rate as necessary 
ultimately  we will only recognize expense for those shares that vest

new accounting standard in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  to create a single model to address accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
interpretation no 
requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions  including a roll forward of tax benefits taken that do not qualify for financial statement recognition 
we will record the cumulative effect of initially adopting interpretation no 
as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adjustment and present such adjustment separately 
only tax positions that we are more likely than not to realize at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of interpretation no 
we are required to adopt interpretation no 
effective for our first quarter of we are currently in the process of assessing the impact of the new standard
