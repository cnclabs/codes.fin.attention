table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we build satellite ground systems and equipment for command and control  integration and test  data processing  and simulation 
since our inception  we have provided ground systems for over different satellite missions for communications  science  meteorology  and earth resource applications 
we have an established domestic and international customer base that includes government and commercial satellite operators  spacecraft and payload manufacturers  and aerospace systems integrators 
we measure financial performance for each operating segment based on income from operations  which consists of revenue less cost of revenue  selling  general administrative  research development  and intangible asset amortization expenses 
this section contains forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
our projections may not in fact be achieved and these projections do not reflect any acquisitions or divestitures that may occur in the future 
reference should be made to the various important factors listed under the heading forward looking statements that could cause actual future results to differ materially 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  complex  or subjective judgments 
our most critical accounting policies  which relate to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  the recoverability of goodwill and other long lived assets  stock based compensation  the recoverability of deferred tax assets  and obsolescence of inventory  are discussed below 
revenue recognition contract revenue we earn revenues from sales of our products and services and may be either a prime contractor directly to the end user of our products and services or we may act as a subcontractor under a contract with another contractor 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the purchase price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we generally earn revenue under three types of contracts fixed price  cost plus a fixed fee  and time materials t m contracts 
revenue under a fixed price contract is recognized using a percentage of completion method based on costs incurred in relation to total estimated costs 
under a cost plus contract  we are reimbursed for allowable costs within the contractual terms and conditions and are paid a negotiated fee 
the fee may be fixed or based on performance incentives 
revenue recognition under a cost plus contract is based upon actual costs incurred and a pro rata amount of the negotiated fee 
under a t m contract  we receive fixed hourly rates intended to cover salary costs attributable to work performed on the contract and related indirect expenses  reimbursement for other direct costs  and a profit 
revenue is recognized under a t m contract at the contractual rates as labor hours and direct expenses are incurred 
to date  the vast majority of contracts for the purchase of our cots software products have been fixed priced in nature  either firm fixed price contracts or t m contracts with fixed labor rates 

table of contents the following table summarizes the percentage of revenues attributable to each contract type for the period indicated fiscal year contract type cost plus fixed price time and materials sale of software products many of our contracts include the sale of company owned proprietary software products 
sales of our software products may take many forms 
we sell software only a software only sale  software and services together  or software  services  and hardware together 
in addition  depending on a customer s requirements  we may or may not provide post contract customer support pcs 
our recognition of revenue from sales of software products depends on specific customer requirements and the nature of the contracts involved 
in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition  for a software only sale  we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the vendor s fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in situations where software is sold together with services and or hardware  we recognize software license revenue on a percentage of completion basis 
we recognize pcs revenue on a percentage of completion basis when pcs is part of a broader fixed price contract that includes software and services 
alternatively  when pcs services ie  software maintenance and support are awarded to us under a separate maintenance contract  we recognize pcs revenue on a straight line basis pro rata over the term of the maintenance contract 
during fiscal year  we incurred approximately million in r d costs in connection with software and hardware products 
we incurred approximately million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year related to r d costs 
we provide products and services under fixed price contracts for which revenue is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method based on the relationship of actual costs incurred to total costs estimated over the duration of the contract 
these estimates regarding costs underlie our determination as to overall contract profitability and the timing of revenue recognition 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of the work to be performed  or do not manage our contracts properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy its obligations under the contracts  then actual results may differ from projected results and losses on contracts may need to be recognized 
we account for cost reimbursable contracts by charging contract costs to operations as incurred and recognizing contract revenues and profits by applying the negotiated fee and or estimated award fee rate to actual costs on an individual contract basis 
management reviews contract performance  costs incurred  and estimated completion costs regularly and adjusts revenues and profits on contracts in the period in which changes become determinable 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts which is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses from the existing accounts receivable 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of individual accounts receivable balances  including the credit worthiness of each customer and the period in which customers financial condition deteriorate and they are no longer able to pay the balances owed to us 
we determine the allowance based on historical experience  review of specific accounts  and past due balances of greater than days and over a specific amount 
account balances are written off against the allowance after all reasonable means of collection have been exhausted and recovery is considered remote 

table of contents to the extent we do not recognize deterioration in our customers financial condition in the period it occurs  or to the extent we overestimate our customers ability to pay  the amount of bad debt expense recognized in a given reporting period will be impacted 
goodwill and other long lived assets long lived assets consist of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  trademarks and agreements  and property and equipment 
long lived assets such as property and equipment and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and is reviewed for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
factors which we consider important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we determine whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash flows  and measure the amount of the impairment based on the related future discounted cash flows 
the cash flow estimates used to determine impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
the estimates of expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas r requires that we account for all stock based compensation transactions using a fair value method and recognize the fair value of each award as an expense over the service period 
the fair value of restricted stock awards is based upon the market price of our common stock at the grant date 
we estimate the fair value of stock option awards  as of the grant date  using the black scholes option pricing model 
the use of the black scholes model requires that we make a number of estimates  including the expected option term  the expected volatility in the price of our common stock  the risk free rate of interest  and the dividend yield on our common stock 
if our expected option term and stock price volatility assumptions were different  the resulting determination of the fair value of stock option awards could be materially different 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the number of share based awards that we expect will ultimately vest upon the fulfillment of service conditions such as time based vesting or the achievement of specific performance conditions 
if the actual number of awards that ultimately vest differs significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
deferred income taxes we recognize a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences as well as the effects of any net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits that may be utilized to reduce future taxes payable 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates  and future tax rate changes are not anticipated 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  the reversal of temporary differences  the forecasts of future taxable income from operations and investments  and ongoing feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require management judgment and are updated periodically based on current business conditions which affect us and overall economic conditions and are consistent with estimates being used to manage the business 
if it is determined more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized  we would record a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would decrease income in the period such determination is made 

table of contents inventories inventory is composed of items that are required to support delivered product or are necessary to fulfill future customer orders 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method of accounting 
obsolete inventory is written off and its value is removed from inventory at the time its obsolescence is determined 
inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales  even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year

sfas no 
fair value measurements 
in october  fasb issued sfas no 
this standard establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurement of a company s assets and liabilities 
this standard also requires that the fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and  generally  must be applied prospectively 
we expect to adopt this standard beginning in october currently  we are evaluating the impact that this new standard will have on our financial position and results of operations 
sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and  generally  must be applied prospectively

staff accounting bulletin sab quantification of financial statement misstatements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued sab no 
regarding the quantification of financial statement misstatements 
sab no 
requires a dual approach for quantifications of errors using both a method that focuses on the income statement impact  including the cumulative effect of prior years misstatements  and a method that focuses on the period end balance sheet 
sab no 
will be effective for us on october  the adoption of sab no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows

space communication systems revenue was million in fiscal  an increase of million or  compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  our space communication systems segment represented of total revenue  compared to in fiscal the increase in revenue in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased bookings and increased product shipments and incremental revenues from lumistar  which was acquired in october  of approximately million 
corporate segment revenue was million in fiscal  a decrease of million  or  compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  our corporate segment represented of total revenue  compared to in fiscal the decrease in revenue for this segment in fiscal was primarily attributable to revenue decreases of million relating to the antenna division as a result of a decision to not pursue new business in this division and decreases in revenue relating to product support 
corporate segment revenue was million in fiscal  a decrease of million or  compared to million in fiscal in fiscal  our corporate segment represented of total revenue  compared to in fiscal the decrease in revenue for this segment in fiscal was primarily attributable to revenue decreases of million relating to the antenna division as a result of a decision to not pursue new business in this division  partially offset by increased product sales of million due to higher license revenue for our cots products 
we ended fiscal with a backlog of approximately million as compared to million at the end of fiscal many of our contracts are multi year contracts and contracts with option years  and portions of these contracts are carried forward from one year to the next as part of our contract backlog 
our total contract backlog represents management s estimate of the aggregate unearned revenues expected to be earned by us over the life of all of our contracts  including option periods 
because many factors affect the scheduling of projects  we cannot predict when revenues will be realized on projects included in our backlog 
in addition  although contract backlog represents only business where we have written agreements with our customers  it is possible that cancellations or scope adjustments may occur 

table of contents gross profit our gross profit can vary significantly depending on the type of product or service provided 
generally  license revenues related to the sale of our cots products have the greatest gross profit because of the minimal incremental costs to produce 
by contrast  gross margin for equipment and subcontractor costs seldom exceed 
engineering service gross margin are typically in the range or higher 
these gross profit and gross margins are realized in all segments  although profit on equipment costs for the space communications systems segment are generally greater than the equipment profit in the other segments because that segment s business is composed of internally developed hardware  firmware  and software products gross profit was million in fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to million in fiscal the increase in gross profit in fiscal was primarily attributable to our ground systems government and ground systems commercial segments

corporate segment gross profit was million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to million in fiscal the increase in gross profit in fiscal was primarily attributable to the discontinued antenna division  which had contract overruns that were recognized during fiscal  and lower product amortization expense 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase in gross profit due to increased license revenue 
operating expenses fiscal operating expenses increased to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to selling expenses  including bid and proposal expense and stock based compensation cost 
fiscal operating expenses increased to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily related to higher legal and accounting expenses incurred to remain compliant with provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  increased r d spending at rt logic  lower product amortization costs and added expenses associated with our exploration of strategic options 
operating expenses in our ground systems government segment increased by million for fiscal compared to fiscal 
table of contents principally due to increased bid and proposal expenses related to a significant new business opportunity with the u 
s  air force and an increased allocation of corporate expenses 
operating expenses in our ground systems government segment increased by approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to increased legal and accounting expenses incurred to remain compliant with provisions of the sarbanes oxley act and related sec regulations 
operating expenses in this segment also increased due to added expenses associated with our previously announced strategy of exploring strategic options  including the possible sale of the business 
operating expenses in our ground systems commercial segment increased by approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher selling expenses and r d spending relating to sat 
operating expenses in our ground systems commercial segment decreased by approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal due to decreased operating expenses at sat and newpoint which were partially offset by an increased allocation of corporate expenses in the segment s command control division 
operating expenses at sat decreased approximately million during the periods being compared primarily due to lower r d expenditures incurred during fiscal compared to fiscal and because of the elimination of product amortization expenses during the fiscal the space communications systems segment s operating expenses for fiscal increased by approximately million compared to fiscal the increase is primarily attributable to higher selling  general  and administrative expense  which includes bid and proposal costs  offset by lower r d expense and intangible amortization expense 
the space communications systems segment s operating expenses for fiscal increased by approximately million compared to fiscal approximately million of the increase is attributable to operating expenses from lumistar  for which we recorded no operating expenses during fiscal increased general and administrative expenses of million coupled with increased r d spending at rt logic accounted for most of the remaining increase in operating expenses from this segment 
corporate segment operating expenses increased by approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to legal costs of approximately million associated with the previously disclosed sec investigation 
in addition  we incurred higher stock based compensation cost  due diligence expenses associated with the previously announced exploration of strategic alternatives  and state tax allocation 
corporate segment operating expenses decreased by approximately million for fiscal compared to fiscal principally due to stock based compensation costs  which decreased million primarily due to a one time stock based compensation charge in fiscal year of approximately million relating to the acceleration of stock options  compared to a million charge in fiscal year using the fair value method in accordance with sfas r 
other income  net other income  net increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal  mostly as a result of increased interest income related to higher interest rates and an increase in the amount of funds invested 
other income  net increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  mostly as a result of increased interest income related to higher interest rates 
income tax expense we recorded income tax expense of million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in income tax expense related primarily to a decrease in the effective tax rate from for fiscal compared to for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily related to the tax benefit realized during fiscal related to the adjustment of deferred tax assets as of september  to the deferred tax asset per the tax return filed for the corresponding period 
income tax expense recorded in fiscal was million 
the increase in income tax expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was related primarily to higher taxable income  offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate from for fiscal to for fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rates is principally due to the elimination of taxes on a one time acceleration of stock options which occurred in fiscal year and was not repeated in fiscal year net income net income was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in net income in fiscal as compared to fiscal related primarily to lower tax expense and higher other income  net  offset by lower operating income 
the increase in net income in fiscal as compared to fiscal related primarily to higher operating income and other income  net  offset by higher tax expense 

table of contents we believe that inflation did not have a material impact on our revenues or income from operations in fiscal years   and outlook this outlook section contains forward looking statements  all of which are based on current expectations 
there is no assurance that our projections will in fact be achieved and these projections do not reflect any acquisitions or divestitures that may occur in the future 
reference should be made to the various important risk factors listed under the heading risk factors in item a of this document 
we realized record revenue and earnings in fiscal and exceeded our original estimates prepared at the end of fiscal our financial performance was better than expected due to significantly higher firm contract commitments and a higher demand for our products and services 
we expect this trend to continue for fiscal for the following reasons continued efforts towards completion of the raidrs  ccs c  pan  protostar and rascom projects 
anticipated higher demand for our epoch suite of products 
anticipated higher demand for our digital processing and signal navigation test equipment 
recent award of phase a of the gps ocx command and control system for the air force 
as a result of these items and other potential awards that we are tracking  we expect revenue and gross profit to grow approximately in fiscal gross profit as a percent of revenue is expected to be flat in compared to primarily due to higher subcontract and other direct costs on existing projects offsetting the higher margins on some of our new contract awards 
operating income is expected to be slightly higher in due to lower legal costs  partially offset by higher costs for investments in r d efforts and infrastructure developments 
interest income is expected to be significantly lower in due a decrease in the amount of available cash for investment purposes as a result of our use of proceeds from the sale of marketable securities and cash from working capital to purchase shares of our common stock in our recent tender offer completed in september income tax expense is expected to be significantly lower in due to expected recovery of r d tax credits from prior years that will be recorded once we prepare the revised tax returns 
the availability of any such tax credit will be subject to review by the internal revenue service 
as a result of these factors  earnings are expected to be in the range of on a per share basis in fiscal in summary  we believe that fiscal will be another record year for revenue and earnings as we continue to implement our strategy of growing the company through aggressive marketing and business development campaigns  improved public communications  improved infrastructure  new senior management and investments in r d efforts 
liquidity and capital resources we have been routinely profitable on an annual basis and have generally financed our working capital needs through funds generated from income from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our general line of credit facility with a commercial bank when necessary 
in june  we supplemented our working capital position by raising approximately million net through the private placement of approximately million shares of our common stock 
in february  we raised an additional million net for use in connection with potential acquisitions and other general corporate purposes through the private placement of million additional shares of our common stock 
on august   we launched a tender offer to purchase up to  shares of our common stock for per share as part of our overall plan to enhance stockholder value 
on september   we accepted for purchase  shares of our common stock tendered in the tender offer at a purchase price of per share 
in september  we sold marketable securities for proceeds of million  which was used  together with cash from operations  to purchase such shares 
we used million of cash to purchase such shares  which included million in fees and expenses 
the repurchase of such shares from the tender offer resulted in a per share increase in our basic and diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter ended september  and fiscal 
table of contents for fiscal year  operating activities provided us million of cash  primarily as a result of net income of million and depreciation and amortization of million  partially offset by a higher accounts receivable balance 
we generated million in investing activities while using million for financing activities 
included in our investing activities is million for the sale of marketable securities  primarily to convert such investments to cash in order to repurchase shares of our common stock in the september tender offer  partially offset by million for the purchase of fixed assets principally new computers and equipment 
included in our financing activities is million in repurchases of common stock  primarily related to the repurchase of shares of our common stock in the tender offer in september for fiscal year  operating activities provided us million of cash 
we used million in investing activities while financing activities provided million

included in the company s financing activities is million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock which was partially offset by million the company used to repurchase shares of its common stock during the period  including million relating to the repurchase of  shares from lumistar  llc during fiscal year  we had access to a line of credit facility through which we could borrow up to million for general corporate purposes 
on september   the credit agreement was amended to permit unsecured borrowing up to million  including a sub facility of million for the issuance of letters of credit 
any borrowings under the facility will accrue interest at the one month london inter bank offering rate libor  plus a margin of to depending on the company s ratio of funded debt to earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation ebitda 
we are required to pay a fee on the undrawn amount of the facility from time to time  at a rate of to per annum  depending on our ratio of funded debt to ebitda  and payable quarterly 
the credit agreement has certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of a maximum ratio of funded debt to ebitda of to and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio of to  and expires on december  the credit agreement contains customary covenants  including affirmative covenants that require  among other things  certain financial reporting by us  and negative covenants that  among other things  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness  incur encumbrances on assets  reorganize  consolidate or merge with any other company  and make acquisitions and stock repurchases 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default  including a cross default to other indebtedness by us 
failure by us to comply with such covenants  or the occurrence of any other event of default  could result in the acceleration of any loans or other financial obligations of by us under the credit agreement and the termination of the facility 
the availability of loans and letters of credit under the facility is subject to customary conditions  including the material accuracy of certain representations and warranties by us and no default continuing under the credit agreement 
at september    and  we had no amounts outstanding under the line of credit 
during fiscal  we paid million in dividends 
on december   our board of directors decided to cease the payment of dividends for the foreseeable future beginning with fiscal and future years in order to maximize the company s ability to invest in future r d  marketing  and business development efforts and strategic acquisition efforts that  in the boards opinion  will result in a greater return for our shareholders 
as we contemplate these strategic efforts to grow the company  the board will continue to evaluate the most effective measures that it can take to maximize shareholder value 
we currently anticipate that our current cash balances  amounts available under our line of credit  and net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk while we currently do not have significant european operations  our customer base is expanding outside the united states and therefore certain contracts now and in the future will likely be denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as foreign currency exchange rates for contracts denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
to mitigate the effect of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we may hedge this risk by entering into forward foreign currency contracts 
as of september   virtually all of our contracts were denominated in us dollars  and we did not have any outstanding hedge agreements 
as we enter into new foreign currency based contracts in the future  we may employ hedging contracts
