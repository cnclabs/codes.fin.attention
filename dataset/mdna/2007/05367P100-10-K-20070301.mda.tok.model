our products may be developed internally or acquired through business combinations 
financial summary total net revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  compared to the year ended december  of the total revenue increase  approximately million represents net revenues from recently acquired businesses  including pinnacle  which was acquired in the third quarter of  and medea  sundance and sibelius  each of which was acquired during the remaining revenue increase is primarily attributable to increased revenues in our audio segment 
for the year ended december   we incurred a net loss of million  compared to net income of million for the same period in the net loss for includes million of acquisition related costs  including a goodwill impairment charge  intangible asset amortization expenses and in process research and development expenses  compared to million of acquisition related costs in our net loss for also includes million of stock based compensation expense resulting from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  on january  the remaining decrease in net income loss from to resulted primarily from an increase in operating expenses that was significantly higher than the year over year increases in revenue and to a lesser extent from decreased gross margins primarily due to a change in product mix 
during  our operating expenses significantly increased due to our recent acquisitions  however  revenue growth did not materialize as expected 
our operating activities continue to generate positive cash flow with cash of million provided by operating activities in  compared to million in in our professional video segment  net revenues increased million  or  to million in as compared to  while segment operating income decreased to million 
the net revenue increase includes revenues of approximately million related to our acquisitions of pinnacle systems  medea and sundance 
the offsetting net revenues decrease of approximately million primarily represents lower than expected revenue from large solution sales  as well as changes in the product mix and average selling price in our media composer family 
our lower than expected revenue from solution sales was due to several factors  including the increasing size and complexity of our customer projects which has lengthened our cycle time to convert an order to revenue  customer logistics delays including changes to on air dates  and delays in delivering specific customer commitments 
the decrease in operating income in reflects an increase in operating expenses due to recent acquisitions and continued investment in new technologies and products  as well as lower gross margins largely due to changes in product mix 
during the fourth quarter of  we initiated a reorganization of the segment s management team and a restructuring plan that we estimate will result in cost savings of approximately million annually 
the reorganization and restructuring actions primarily impacted the management and sales teams as the division has re aligned its resources to more effectively serve customers 
we expect to re invest a majority of the cost savings during to fill the needs of the new management and sales teams 
we anticipate that our investments and the recent reorganization will result in improved operating results for in our audio segment  net revenues increased by million  or  to million in as compared to  while segment operating income increased to million 
of the total revenue increase  approximately million relates to our acquisition of sibelius in july the remaining increase represents continued strong demand for our products in both the professional and home user markets with increased revenues from the m audio and live sound venue product line  as well as from sales of the digidesign pro tools hd and le systems 
the segment s operating income increased due to slightly lower operating expenses than in we expect operating expenses to increase for our audio segment in as we invest for future growth in the division 
the consumer video segment was formed as part of our august acquisition of pinnacle  so comparisons of revenues and segment operating results for to are not meaningful 
for the year ended december   this segment had net revenues of million and an operating loss of million 
net revenues and operating results for were lower than expected  due in large part to product quality issues in our home editing product line 
to address the product reliability issues and improve operating efficiency of the business  we made operational changes during and have been focusing on several initiatives  including product development  marketing and sales efforts to generate consumer demand  and expansion of the sales channel 
during the fourth quarter of  we also initiated a restructuring plan for this segment that we estimate will result in cost savings of approximately million annually 
net revenues increased throughout  with an expected significant increase in the fourth quarter due to the holiday buying season 
we expect the consumer video segment s operating results to improve for the full year of segment operating income excludes stock based compensation  amortization of intangible assets  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  in process research and development expense and net restructuring costs 
these costs are not considered when evaluating the ongoing operating results of our segments 
the following table sets forth certain items from our consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated for the year ended december  product revenues services revenues total revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative amortization of intangible assets impairment of goodwill and intangible assets restructuring costs  net in process research and development total operating expenses operating income loss interest and other income expense  net income loss before income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss we derive a significant percentage of our revenue from sales to customers outside the united states 
such international sales accounted for of our net revenues for both and  compared to for our international business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risk that changes in foreign currency could materially impact  either positively or adversely  our revenues  net income and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into short term foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting transaction and remeasurement gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are fixed in the short term and we plan our expense run rate based on our expectations of future revenues 
in addition  a significant percentage of our sales transactions are completed during the final weeks or days of each quarter and  therefore  we generally do not know whether revenues have met our expectations until after the end of the quarter 
if we have a shortfall in revenues in any given quarter  there is an immediate effect on our overall earnings 
see item a risk factors for additional risk factors that may cause our future results to differ materially from our current expectations 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we regularly reevaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges  stock based compensation  allowances for bad debts and reserves for recourse under financing transactions  the valuation of inventories  business combinations  and goodwill and other intangible assets  and income tax assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and involve our most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments 
revenue recognition and allowances for product returns and exchanges we generally recognize revenue from sales of software and software related products upon receipt of a signed purchase order or contract and product shipment to distributors or end users  provided that collection is reasonably assured  the fee is fixed or determinable and all other revenue recognition criteria of statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition  as amended  are met 
in addition  for certain transactions where our services are non routine or essential to the delivered products  we record revenue upon satisfying the criteria of sop and obtaining customer acceptance 
within our professional video segment  much of our audio segment and our consumer video segment we follow the guidance of sop for revenue recognition because our products and services are software or software related 
however  for certain offerings in our audio segment  software is incidental to the delivered products and services 
for these products  we record revenue based on satisfying the criteria in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition 
in connection with many of our product sale transactions  customers may purchase a maintenance and support agreement 
we recognize revenue from maintenance contracts on a ratable basis over their term 
we recognize revenue from training  installation or other services as the services are performed 
we use the residual method to recognize revenues when an order includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date and evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered element  typically professional services or maintenance  is deferred and the remaining portion of the total arrangement fee is recognized as revenue related to the delivered element 
if evidence of the fair value of one or more undelivered elements does not exist  we defer all revenues and only recognize them when delivery of those elements occurs or when fair value can be established 
fair value is typically based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately to customers 
however  in certain transactions  fair value of maintenance is based on the renewal price that is offered as a contractual right to the customer  provided that such renewal price is substantive 
our current pricing practices are influenced primarily by product type  purchase volume  term and customer location 
we review services revenues sold separately and corresponding renewal rates on a periodic basis and update  when appropriate  our fair value for such services used for revenue recognition purposes to ensure that it reflects our recent pricing experience 
in most cases  the products we sell do not require significant production  modification or customization of software 
installation of the products is generally routine  requires minimal effort and is not typically performed by us 
however  certain transactions  typically those involving orders from end users for a significant number of products for a single customer site  such as news broadcasters  require that we perform an installation effort that we deem to be complex and non routine 
in these situations  we do not recognize revenue for either the products shipped or the installation services until the installation is complete 
in addition  if such orders include a customer acceptance provision  no revenue is recognized until the customer s acceptance of the products and services has been received or the acceptance period has lapsed 
telephone support  enhancements and unspecified upgrades typically are provided at no additional charge during the product s initial warranty period generally between days and twelve months  which precedes commencement of the maintenance contracts 
we defer the fair value of this support period and recognize the related revenue ratably over the initial warranty period 
we also from time to time offer certain customers free upgrades or specified future products or enhancements 
for each of these elements that is undelivered at the time of product shipment and provided that we have vendor specific objective evidence regarding the fair value of the undelivered element  we defer the fair value of the specified upgrade  product or enhancement and recognize that revenue only upon later delivery or at the time at which the remaining contractual terms relating to the upgrade have been satisfied 
in  approximately of our revenue was derived from indirect sales channels  including authorized resellers and distributors 
within our professional video segment  our resellers and distributors are generally not granted rights to return products to us after purchase  and actual product returns from them have been insignificant to date 
however  distributors of our avid media composer  avid xpress pro and avid mojo product lines have a contractual right to return a percentage of prior quarter purchases 
the return provision for these distributors has not had a material impact on our results of operations 
in contrast  some channel partners  particularly our audio and certain of our consumer video channel partners  are offered limited rights of return  stock rotation  and price protection 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we record a provision for estimated returns and other allowances  as a reduction of revenues  in the same period that related revenues are recorded 
management estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing and maintaining a sales allowance for expected returns and other credits 
in making such estimates  we analyze historical returns and credits and the amounts of products held by major resellers and consider the impact of new product introductions  changes in customer demand  current economic conditions and other known factors 
we maintain a rolling history of returns on a product by product basis and analyze returns and credits by product category 
the amount and timing of our revenue for any period may be impacted if actual product returns or other reseller credits prove to be materially different from our estimates 
a portion of our revenue from sales of consumer video products is derived from transactions with channel partners who have unlimited return rights and from whom payment is contingent upon the product being sold through to their customers 
accordingly  revenue for these channel partners is recognized when the products are sold through to the customer instead of being recognized at the time products are shipped to the channel partners 
from time to time  we offer rebates on purchases of certain products or rebates based on purchasing volume that are accounted for as reductions to revenue upon shipment of related products or expected achievement of purchasing volumes 
in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products  consideration given to customers or resellers under the rebate program is recorded as a reduction to revenue because we do not receive an identifiable benefit that is sufficiently separable from the sale of our products 
at the time of a sales transaction  we make an assessment of the collectibility of the amount due from the customer 
revenue is recognized only if we are reasonably assured that collection will occur 
in making this assessment  we consider customer credit worthiness and historical payment experience 
if it is determined from the outset of the arrangement that collection is not reasonably assured based upon our credit review process  revenue is recognized on a cash collected basis to the extent that the other criteria of sop and sab no 
are satisfied 
at the outset of the arrangement  we assess whether the fee associated with the order is fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties 
in assessing whether the fee is fixed or determinable  we consider the payment terms of the transaction  our collection experience in similar transactions without making concessions  and our involvement  if any  in third party financing transactions  among other factors 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  revenue is recognized only as payments become due from the customer  provided that all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally days  but can be up to days  after the invoice date  we evaluate whether we have sufficient history of successfully collecting past transactions with similar terms 
if that collection history is successful  then revenue is recognized upon delivery of the products  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are satisfied 
we record as revenue all amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling costs and record the actual shipping costs as a component of cost of revenues 
we record reimbursements received from customers for out of pocket expenses as revenue  with related costs recorded as cost of revenues 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of  and started to account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires employee stock based compensation awards to be accounted for under the fair value method and eliminates the ability to account for these instruments under the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method as permitted under sfas r 
under this method  we are required to record compensation cost  based on the fair value estimated in accordance with sfas r  for stock based awards granted after the date of adoption over the requisite service periods for the individual awards  which generally equals the vesting period 
we are also required to record compensation cost for the unvested portion of previously granted stock based awards outstanding at the date of adoption over the requisite service periods for the individual awards based on the fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
adjusted for forfeitures as required by sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for stock based compensation under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recorded for options issued to employees and non employee directors in fixed amounts and with fixed exercise prices at least equal to the market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
in connection with our acquisition of m audio in august  we assumed options to certain m audio employees at exercise prices that were less than the market price of our common stock at the date of grant 
we recorded as deferred compensation a portion of the difference between the exercise prices and the fair value of the options at the date of completion of the acquisition  determined under the black scholes method  multiplied by the number of shares underlying the options 
the resulting deferred compensation is being expensed over the vesting period of the options 
additionally  deferred compensation was recorded for restricted stock granted to employees based on the market price of our common stock at the date of grant  which was being expensed over the period in which the restrictions lapse 
in connection with the adoption of sfas r on january   we reversed the remaining deferred compensation of million  with the offset to additional paid in capital 
in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r  on october   our board of directors approved a partial acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding options to purchase our common stock that were granted on february  vesting was accelerated for options to purchase  shares of our common stock with an exercise price of per share  including options to purchase  shares of our common stock held by our executive officers 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made to avoid recognizing compensation cost related to these out of the money options in our future statements of operations upon the adoption of sfas r 
it is estimated that the maximum future compensation expense that would have been recorded in our statements of operations had the vesting of these options not been accelerated is approximately million 
the fair values of restricted stock awards  including restricted stock and restricted stock units  are based on the intrinsic values of the awards at the date of grant 
as permitted under sfas no 
and sfas r  we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
the black scholes model relies on a number of key assumptions to calculate estimated fair values 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
since adoption of sfas r on january   the expected stock price volatility assumption used by us has been based on recent six month trailing implied volatility calculations 
these calculations are performed on exchange traded options of our stock 
we believe that using a forward looking market driven volatility assumption will result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
prior to adoption of sfas r  the expected volatility was based on the historical volatility of the underlying stock 
the assumed risk free interest rate is the us treasury security rate with a term equal to the expected life of the option 
the assumed expected life is based on company specific historical experience 
with regard to the estimate of the expected life  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
based on our historical turnover rates  an annualized estimated forfeiture rate of has been used in calculating the estimated compensation cost for the year ended december  additional expense will be recorded if the actual forfeiture rates are lower than estimated  and a recovery of prior expense will be recorded if the actual forfeitures are higher than estimated 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  forfeitures were not estimated at the time of award 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
the guidance in sfas r is relatively new and the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
see footnote l to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding our adoption of sfas r 
during  we granted restricted stock units  rather than stock options  as part of our annual stock based compensation program 
also during  we granted restricted stock and stock options to new hires and for other purposes 
in the future  we may grant either stock awards  options  or other equity based instruments allowed by our stock based compensation plans  or a combination thereof  as part of our overall compensation strategy 
allowance for bad debts and reserves for recourse under financing transactions we maintain allowances for estimated bad debt losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments for products or services 
when evaluating the adequacy of the allowances  we analyze accounts receivable balances  historical bad debt experience  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness and current economic trends 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
we provide third party lease financing options to certain customers 
we are not generally a party to the leases  however  during the terms of these leases  which are generally three years  we remain liable for any unpaid principal balance upon default by the end user  but such liability is limited in the aggregate 
we record revenue from these transactions upon the shipment of our products because we believe that our collection experience with similar transactions supports our assessment that the fee is fixed or determinable 
we have operated these programs for over ten years and to date defaults under the program have consistently ranged between and 
we maintain reserves for estimated recourse losses under this financing program based on these historical default rates 
while we have experienced insignificant losses from defaults to date under this program  deterioration in the financial condition of our customers who participate in the program could require additional reserves 
see footnote j to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding third party lease financing 
inventories inventory in the digital media market  including our inventory  is subject to rapid technological change or obsolescence 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and write down inventory to its realizable value to reflect estimated obsolescence or lack of marketability based upon assumptions about future inventory demand generally for the following twelve months and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than we estimate  additional inventory write downs may be required 
business combinations when we acquire new businesses  we allocate the purchase price of businesses acquired to the assets  including intangible assets  and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values  with any amount in excess of such allocations designated as goodwill 
significant management judgments and assumptions are required in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities  particularly acquired intangible assets 
for example  it is necessary to estimate the portion of development efforts that are associated with technology that is in process and has no alternative future use 
the valuation of purchased intangible assets is based upon estimates of the future performance and cash flows from the acquired business 
if different assumptions are used  it could materially impact the purchase price allocation and our financial position and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets we assess the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on at least an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be fully recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to the historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or component thereof will be sold or otherwise disposed of  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  a significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  a reduction of our market capitalization relative to our net book value and other such circumstances 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we do not amortize goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets 
the goodwill impairment test prescribed by sfas no 
requires us to identify reporting units and to determine estimates of the fair values of our reporting units as of the date we test for impairment 
our organizational structure is based on strategic business units that offer various products to the principal markets in which our products are sold professional video  audio and consumer video 
our reporting units equate to these strategic business units 
all three of the reporting units include goodwill 
we complete our annual impairment tests as of the end of the fourth quarter of each year 
in our goodwill impairment analysis  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its carrying value  including goodwill 
we generally use a discounted cash flow valuation model to determine the fair values of our reporting units 
this model focuses on estimates of future revenues and profits for each reporting unit and also assumes a terminal value for the unit based on a multiple of revenue 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
for reporting units comprised primarily of acquired businesses  we utilize the same technique as was used to value the acquisition assuming it is consistent with the objective of measuring fair value 
if the reporting unit s carrying value exceeds its fair value  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill and its implied fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  our impairment testing determined that the carrying value of our consumer video reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
the fair value of the consumer video unit was based on a multiple of revenue technique similar to that used in valuing the pinnacle acquisition  updated for current revenue projections 
the estimated fair value was then allocated among all the assets and liabilities of the consumer video business  with the excess fair value representing the implied fair value of goodwill 
because the book value of consumer video s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value by million  we recorded this amount as an impairment loss 
in our identifiable intangibles impairment analysis  if events or circumstances exist that indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  the fair value of each asset is compared to its carrying value 
if the asset s carrying value is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value  we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its fair value 
the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in connection with the goodwill impairment charge taken for the consumer video reporting unit  we also reviewed the consumer video identifiable intangible assets for possible impairment 
this analysis included grouping the intangible assets with other operating assets and liabilities in the consumer video business that would not otherwise be subject to impairment testing  because the grouped assets and liabilities represent the lowest level for which cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities within avid 
the result of this analysis was that the undiscounted cash flows of the consumer video net asset groups exceeded the carrying value  indicating no impairment loss had occurred 
income tax assets we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits and operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the level of deferred tax assets as of december   the level of historical us losses  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the continued establishment of a full valuation allowance against the us net deferred tax assets 
in  we removed the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets in our irish manufacturing operations 
this resulted in a non cash million tax benefit recorded through our provision for income taxes 
the decision to remove the valuation allowance was based on the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset in ireland would be realized 
our assessment of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets could change in the future based upon our levels of pre tax income and other tax related adjustments 
removal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in the provision for income taxes during the period of removal 
if the valuation allowance of million as of december  were to be removed in its entirety  a million non cash reduction in income tax expense and a million credit to goodwill related to pinnacle net operating losses  tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences would be recorded 
to the extent no valuation allowance is established for our deferred tax assets in future periods  future financial statements would reflect a non cash increase in our provision for income taxes 
for and  the impact to goodwill resulting from the utilization of acquired us deferred tax assets was million and million  respectively 
in addition to the tax assets described above  we have deferred tax assets totaling million  resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
r  recognition of these assets would occur upon utilization of these deferred tax assets to reduce taxes payable and would result in a credit to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity rather than the provision for income taxes 
as a result of the exercise of employee stock options  we recorded increases to additional paid in capital of million and million in and  respectively 
results of operations in the first quarter of  with the adoption of sfas r  we began to record stock based compensation expense for the fair value of stock options 
stock based compensation expense of million  million and million  resulting from the adoption of sfas r  the acquisition of m audio and the issuance of restricted stock and restricted stock units  was included in the following captions in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december   and  respectively years ended december  in thousands product cost of revenues services cost of revenues research and development expense marketing and selling expense general and administrative expense in addition  stock based compensation totaling  was included in the caption restructuring costs  net during related to stock based compensation expense for the acceleration of vesting for certain employees who were terminated in a restructuring program 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost  before forfeitures  related to non vested stock based compensation awards granted under our stock based compensation plans 
this cost will be recognized over the next four years 
we expect this cost to be amortized as follows million in  million in  million in and million thereafter 
see footnotes b and l to our consolidated financial statements in item for further information regarding our stock based compensation assumptions and expenses  including pro forma disclosures for the years ended december  and net revenues comparison of to years ended december  and dollars in thousands net revenues of consolidated net revenues net revenues of consolidated net revenues change change in revenues professional video product revenues services revenues total audio product revenues services revenues total consumer video product revenues nm a total nm a total net revenues a comparison is not meaningful as the consumer video segment was formed in august with the acquisition of pinnacle systems 
professional video product revenues increased million from to for  pinnacle products accounted for million of professional video product revenues  compared to million for  representing an increase of million 
the increase in pinnacle product revenues was offset by a net decrease of million for all other product families  including decreased revenues from our media composer and broadcast news product families  offset by increased revenues from our shared storage systems and high end editing systems 
for the year  we had lower than expected revenue from large solution sales  which was due to several factors  including the increasing size and complexity of our customer projects which has lengthened our cycle time to convert an order to revenue  our delays in delivering specific customer commitments and customer logistics delays  including changes to on air dates 
in our media composer product family specifically  we introduced a software only version of the product in the second quarter of  which has significantly lower average selling prices than the media composer adrenaline product 
although unit sales for the media composer product family increased from to  the shift in product mix to the software only version  as well as a reduction in average selling price of our adrenaline hd product  resulted in a year over year decrease to total revenue for this product family 
our shared storage systems and high end editing systems experienced increased revenues in  which was primarily due to new product introductions of avid unity isis and symphony nitris in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
services revenues consist primarily of maintenance contracts  installation services and training 
professional video services revenues resulting from the pinnacle acquisition were million and million for and  respectively 
the remaining increases in services revenues were primarily due to an increase in maintenance contracts sold in connection with our products  as well as increased revenue generated from professional services  such as installation services provided in connection with large broadcast news deals 
of the total million increase in our audio segment product revenues in  compared to  approximately million relates to our acquisition of sibelius in july the remaining increase represents increased revenues from our m audio family of products  including guitar products  keyboards and control surfaces and our digidesign products  including the pro tools hd systems  pro tools le products and venue d show live sound mixing consoles 
sales of digidesign s pro tools hd systems slowed in the third quarter of due to a transition to the intel based macintosh platform  but improved in the fourth quarter 
we believe that customers delayed their pro tools hd purchases pending evaluation of the new mac pro desktop computers and a new version of pro tools software to support the new computers 
there was also a lack of updated third party software plug in products that supported the new machines 
revenues from pro tools hd systems increased in the fourth quarter of  resulting in an overall increase in such revenues from to the consumer video segment was formed during the third quarter of with our acquisition of pinnacle  therefore  revenues for this segment for and are not comparable 
net revenues  which are primarily derived from our home editing and tv viewing product lines  were lower than expected for the year  due in large part to product quality issues in our home editing product line 
we focused on several operating initiatives during to address the product reliability issues and improve operating efficiency of the business 
quarterly net revenues for the consumer video segment increased during the year  with an expected significant increase in the fourth quarter due to the holiday buying season 
revenues for our home editing product line increased steadily during the third and fourth quarters of  which we believe are the result of improvements that we have made to the pinnacle studio product  including our release of the pinnacle studio anniversary edition in europe during the third quarter of revenues from our tv viewing products were particularly strong during the second and fourth quarters of we believe the second quarter was strong as a result of new pctv product releases across europe and increased consumer demand during the world cup tournament  both of which occurred in that quarter 
increased sales in the fourth quarter were the result of the release of pinnacle s pctv hd pro stick in the us in the third quarter coupled with strong holiday sales in the fourth quarter 
net revenues derived through indirect channels were approximately for compared to for the increase in indirect selling is due primarily to the acquisition of pinnacle  which sells products almost exclusively through indirect channels  and the growth in revenue from our audio segment  which also sells a large percentage of products through indirect channels 
sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of our net revenues for both and such international sales increased by million  or  in compared to the increase in international sales in occurred primarily in europe  and to a lesser extent in asia  and is primarily due to the acquisition of pinnacle  which has a significant portion of its sales in europe and asia

the acquisition of pinnacle accounted for million of professional video product revenues for  all of which was recognized during the period from august  through december  the remaining million increase in product revenues for this segment  as compared to  was related to increased unit sales volume of certain key products  especially our avid unity medianetwork  newscutter and workgroups products  offset in part by declines in other product families including  the media composer product family 
this increase in net product revenues was also offset in part by lower average selling prices of certain of our products 
average selling prices include the mix of products high or low end sold  impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and the impact of price changes and discounting

professional video services revenues for resulting from the pinnacle acquisition were million from the acquisition date of august  through december  the remaining increase in professional video service revenues comes primarily from increases in maintenance contracts sold on our products 
professional services  such as installation services provided in connection with large broadcast news deals  also increased 
net revenues derived through indirect channels were approximately for  compared to for the decrease in indirect selling from to was primarily due to the growth in sales of our broadcast news customers  which generally require a longer selling cycle  and the acquisition of avid nordic in september sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of our net revenues for  compared to for such international sales increased by million  or  in compared to the increase in international sales in occurred in all regions and was due to the impact of the acquisitions of pinnacle and m audio and an increased number of large international broadcast sales 
gross profit cost of revenues consists primarily of costs associated with the procurement of components  the assembly  testing and distribution of finished products  warehousing  post sales customer support costs related to maintenance contract revenue and other services  and royalties for third party software and hardware included in our products 
cost of revenues also includes amortization of technology  which represents the amortization of developed technology assets acquired in the august pinnacle acquisition and  to a lesser extent  the m audio  sibelius  sundance  medea and wizoo acquisitions  and is described further in the amortization of intangible assets section below 
gross margin fluctuates based on factors such as the mix of products sold  the cost and proportion of third party hardware and software included in the systems sold  the offering of product upgrades  price discounts and other sales promotion programs  the distribution channels through which products are sold  the timing of new product introductions  sales of aftermarket hardware products such as disk drives and currency exchange rate fluctuations

amortization of intangible assets intangible assets result from acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and include developed technology  customer related intangibles  trade names and other identifiable intangible assets with finite lives 
these intangible assets are amortized using the straight line method  with the exception of developed technology 
developed technology is amortized over the greater of the amount calculated using the ratio of current quarter revenues to the total of current quarter and anticipated future revenues over the estimated useful lives of two to three years  or the straight line method over each product s remaining respective useful life

as a result of the professional video restructuring program  employees worldwide  primarily in the management and sales teams  were notified that their employment would be terminated and a small leased office in australia was closed 
the total estimated costs for the employee terminations are million and the total costs for the facility closure are million 
the purpose of the program was to improve the efficiency of our organizational structure 
the estimated annual cost savings expected to result from this restructuring total approximately million  however  we expect to reinvest the majority of these savings during to fill the needs of the new management and sales teams 
as a result of the consumer video restructuring program  employees worldwide  primarily in the sales and engineering teams  were notified that their employment would be terminated and a portion of a leased facility in germany was vacated 
the total estimated costs for the employee terminations are m and the total costs for the facility closure are million 
the purpose of the program was to reduce costs and improve the efficiency of our organizational structure 
the estimated annual cost savings expected to result from this restructuring action total approximately million 
also during the fourth quarter of  a new subtenant was found for a portion of our london  uk facility vacated as part of a restructuring program 
this resulted in a lower estimate of the restructuring accrual required for this facility and a recovery of million was recorded in our statement of operations 
during the third quarter of  we reached an agreement with the landlord of our daly city  california facility and executed an amendment to the existing lease for that office space which extended the lease through september based on the new terms of the amended lease and our changing facilities requirements  we have determined that we will re occupy the space in this facility that had previously been vacated under a restructuring plan 
accordingly  the million restructuring accrual for that facility was reversed 
in march  we implemented a restructuring program within our consumer video segment under which employees worldwide  primarily in the marketing and selling and the research and development teams  were notified that their employment would be terminated 
the purpose of the program was to maximize the efficiency of our organizational structure 
in connection with this action  we recorded a charge of million in the statement of operations during the first quarter of in the third quarter of  payments to these employees were completed and approximately million remaining in the related restructuring accrual was reversed 
the estimated annual cost savings expected to result from this restructuring action total approximately million 
in december  we implemented a restructuring program within our professional video segment under which employees worldwide were terminated and a portion of a leased facility in montreal  canada was vacated 
in connection with these actions  we recorded charges of million for employment terminations and million for facilities costs 
the estimated annual cost savings expected to result from these restructuring activities total million 
the remaining restructuring charge of million primarily resulted from a revised estimate of the lease obligation associated with a facility that was vacated as part of a restructuring plan in the revision became necessary when one of the subtenants in the facility gave notice of their intention to discontinue their sublease 
in process research and development we recorded in process research and development  or r d  charges of million in the third quarter of related to the acquisition of sibelius  million in the first quarter of related to the acquisition of medea  million in the third quarter of related to the acquisition of pinnacle  and million in the third quarter of related to the acquisition of wizoo 
these in process r d charges represent product development efforts that were underway at sibelius  medea  pinnacle and wizoo at the time of the respective acquisitions for which technological feasibility had not yet been established 
technological feasibility is established when either of the following criteria is met detailed program design has been completed  documented and traced to product specifications and its high risk development issues have been resolved  or a working model of the product has been finished and determined to be complete and consistent with the product design 
as of the respective acquisition dates  sibelius  medea  pinnacle and wizoo had not completed product designs or working models for the in process technology  and we determined that there was no future alternative use for the technologies beyond the stated purpose of the specific r d projects  therefore  the fair value of the in process r d efforts were expensed at the time of the respective acquisitions 
the key assumptions used in the in process r d valuations consisted of the expected completion dates for the in process projects  estimated costs to complete the projects  revenue and expense projections assuming future release of the product and a risk adjusted discount rate 
the discount rate is based upon the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks such as delays or uncertainties in bringing the products to market and competitive pressures 
such risks vary from acquisition to acquisition based on the characteristics of the acquired company and the applications of the acquired technology 
projections of revenues and expenses  the estimated costs to complete the projects and the determination of the appropriate discount rate reflect management s best estimates of such factors at the time of the valuation 
for purposes of valuing the in process r d of sibelius  medea  pinnacle and wizoo  we used discount rates of   and  respectively

our effective tax rate  which is our tax provision as a percentage of profit before tax  was  and  respectively  for  and the increase in the effective tax rate for  as compared to  results from a non deductible impairment of goodwill charge and an increase in deferred taxes related to the utilization of acquired net operating losses and acquired timing differences  partially offset by a reduction in tax contingency reserves 
we generally recognize no significant us tax benefit from the acquisition related amortization 
except for a minimal amount of state tax payments  the federal and state tax provisions are non cash provisions due to the tax impact of net operating loss carryforwards related to stock option deductions and acquisition related net operating loss carryforwards 
the tax rate in each year is affected by net changes in the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
based on the level of deferred tax assets as of december  and the level of historical us losses  we have determined that the uncertainty regarding the realization of these assets is sufficient to warrant the continued establishment of a full valuation allowance against the us net deferred tax assets 
in the quarter ended december   we removed the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets of our irish manufacturing operations 
the decision to remove the valuation allowance was based on the conclusion that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset in ireland would be realized 
due to the removal of the valuation allowance  we now have a non cash provision for income taxes related to our irish operations 
our assessment of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets could change in the future based upon our levels of pre tax income and other tax related adjustments 
reversal of the valuation allowance in whole or in part would result in a non cash reduction in income tax expense during the period of reversal 
to the extent there is a reversal of some or all of the valuation allowance  future financial statements would reflect an increase in non cash income tax expense until such time as our deferred tax assets are all used to reduce current taxes payable 
excluding the impact of the valuation allowance  our effective tax rate would have been  and  respectively  for the years  and these rates differ from the federal statutory rate of primarily due to the mix of income and losses in foreign jurisdictions  which have tax rates that differ from the statutory rate  non deductible impairment of goodwill expenses  and non deductible acquisition related expenses

days sales outstanding in accounts receivable was days at both december  and at december  and  we held inventory in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
these balances include stockroom  spares and demonstration equipment inventories at various locations and inventory at customer sites related to shipments for which we have not yet recognized revenue 
the increase in inventory of approximately million from december  to december  includes an increase of approximately million for inventory shipped to customer locations for which revenue has not yet been recognized  primarily due to an increased number and size of large solution sales as well as lower than expected revenue on such sales in the remaining increase in inventory was attributable to several factors including lower than expected shipments in the fourth quarter of  increased inventory related to large storage and workgroup solution products which have more expensive component parts  higher inventory levels due to longer procurement and transportation lead times associated with our expanded outsourced manufacturing programs in asia  and inventory acquired from our acquisitions of medea  sundance and sibelius

in connection with non acquisition related restructuring activities during  and prior periods  as of december   we have future cash obligations of approximately million under leases for which we have vacated the underlying facilities  and restructuring accruals of million and million related to severance and lease obligations  respectively 
the lease accrual represents the excess of our lease commitments on space no longer used by us over expected payments to be received on subleases of such facilities 
severance payments will be made during lease payments will be made over the remaining terms of the leases  which have varying expiration dates through  unless we are able to negotiate earlier terminations

see footnote n to our consolidated financial statements in item for the activity in the restructuring and other costs accrual for our cash requirements vary depending upon factors such as our planned growth  capital expenditures  acquisitions of businesses or technologies and obligations under past restructuring programs 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities and funds generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in the event that we require additional financing  we believe that we will be able to obtain such financing  however  there can be no assurance that we would be successful in doing so  or that we could do so on favorable terms

during the terms of these financing arrangements  which are generally for three years  we remain liable for a portion of the unpaid principal balance in the event of a default on the lease by the end user  but our liability is limited in the aggregate based on a percentage of initial amounts funded or  in certain cases  amounts of unpaid balances 
as of december   our maximum exposure under this program was million 
we have a stand by letter of credit at a bank that is used as a security deposit in connection with our daly city  california office space lease 
in the event of a default on this lease  the landlord would be eligible to draw against this letter of credit to a maximum  as of december   of million 
the letter of credit will remain in effect at this amount throughout the remaining lease period  which runs through september as of december   we were not in default of this lease 
in connection with our acquisition of wizoo  we became contingently obligated to make additional payments to the former shareholders of wizoo of up to million  dependent upon wizoo achieving four engineering milestones through january these payments  if required  would be recorded as additional purchase consideration  allocated to goodwill 
as of december   three of the engineering milestones have been met and million has been recorded as additional purchase price

related to the transition to fin  the fasb has issued two methods  alternative a and alternative b  for reporting subsequent events occurring during the first quarter of we have elected to use alternative b as its method for reporting subsequent events 
under alternative b  we will no longer recognize differences between type i and type ii subsequent events 
type i events are those items that would effect pre fin adoption accounting and therefore would be reflected in the financial statements at december  type ii subsequent events would not have an impact on pre fin adoption accounting 
when determining the cumulative effect adjustment  the subsequent information would not be considered as available and  therefore  the information is not reflected in the cumulative effect adjustment at january  although we have not completed the process of evaluating the effects that will result from adopting fin  based on our preliminary analysis  we do not believe that there will be a material impact on its financial position or results of operation 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  an amendment to fasb statement no 
sfas no 
requires recognition of a servicing asset or servicing liability whenever an entity enters into certain service agreements which result in an obligation to service a financial asset  and requires that servicing assets and servicing liabilities be recognized at fair value  if practicable 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after september   or january  for avid 
adoption of sfas no 
will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  an amendment to fasb statements no 
and sfas no 
permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 
sfas no 
will be effective for fiscal years beginning after september   or january  for avid 
as of december   we did not have any hybrid financial instruments subject to the fair value election of sfas no 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk we have significant international operations and  therefore  our revenues  earnings  cash flows and financial position are exposed to foreign currency risk from foreign currency denominated receivables  payables  sales transactions  as well as net investments in foreign operations 
we derive more than half of our revenues from customers outside the united states 
this business is  for the most part  transacted through international subsidiaries and generally in the currency of the end user customers 
therefore  we are exposed to the risks that changes in foreign currency could adversely impact our revenues  net income and cash flow 
to hedge against the foreign exchange exposure of certain forecasted receivables  payables and cash balances of our foreign subsidiaries  we enter into short term foreign currency forward contracts 
there are two objectives of our foreign currency forward contract program to offset any foreign exchange currency risk associated with cash receipts expected to be received from our customers over the next day period and to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange on our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the legal entity 
these forward contracts typically mature within days of execution 
we record gains and losses associated with currency rate changes on these contracts in results of operations  offsetting gains and losses on the related assets and liabilities 
the success of this hedging program depends on forecasts of transaction activity in the various currencies and contract rates versus financial statement rates 
to the extent that these forecasts are overstated or understated during the periods of currency volatility  we could experience unanticipated currency gains or losses 
at december   we had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional value of million  denominated in the euro  british pound  swedish krona  norwegian krone  danish kroner  canadian dollar  japanese yen  australian dollar  singapore dollar and korean won  as a hedge against forecasted foreign currency denominated receivables  payables and cash balances 
for  net losses of million resulting from forward contracts were included in results of operations  offset by net transaction and remeasurement gains on the related assets and liabilities of million 
as of december   we also had a foreign currency forward contract with a notional value of million to hedge our net investment in our canadian subsidiary 
at december   the fair value of this forward contract was million 
the currency effect of the net investment hedge is deemed effective and is  therefore  reflected as a component of foreign currency translation in accumulated other comprehensive income 
interest effects of this hedge are reported in interest income 
a hypothetical change in foreign currency rates would not have a material impact on our results of operations  assuming the above mentioned forecast of foreign currency exposure is accurate  because the impact on the forward contracts as a result of a change would at least partially offset the impact on the asset and liability positions of our foreign subsidiaries 
interest rate risk at december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  including short term corporate obligations  asset backed securities and government agency obligations 
marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at market value  with any unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair market value of these instruments due to their short maturity
