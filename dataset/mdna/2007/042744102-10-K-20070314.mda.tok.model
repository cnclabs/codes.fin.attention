when necessary  prior year s financial information has been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
a 
overview summary of financial results we reported net income of million for  a decrease of million  or  compared to diluted earnings per share of represented a decrease of  or  from during  as in  the challenge of maintaining high quality earning assets in the face of falling net interest margins placed great pressure on our earnings 
for the third consecutive year  our net interest margin decreased  reflecting the industry wide trend 
the decrease could only be offset by expanding our current operations and or by entering into new lines of business 
we did achieve a measured degree of growth 
although total assets at december  were essentially unchanged from the prior year  average earning assets increased million  or  from this was partly the result of our acquisition transactions we completed in in april  we completed a branch transaction  wh ich added three branches and approximately million in deposits to our pre existing franchise 
see the more detailed discussion of this acquisition on page of this report 
at december   our tangible book value per share calculated based on shareholders equity reduced by intangible assets including goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to  an increase of  or  from year end our total shareholders equity at year end was only slightly above the year end level  despite million of net income for the year  due primarily to i cash dividends million  ii repurchases of our own common stock million and iii the impact of adopting sfas no 
which increased our recorded liability for post retirement benefits and decreased shareholders equity by million  net of tax 
as of the last trading day of  the average of our bid and asked stock price was  resulting in a trading multiple of to tangible book value 
the board of directors increased the quarterly cash dividend to 
per share for the fourth quarter of for the year  total cash dividends as adjusted for stock dividends were 
for compared to 
for  an increase of  or 
nonperforming loans amounted to million at december   an increase of thousand from the prior year end 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to period end loans was 
at december   an increase from 
one year earlier 
loans charged off net of recoveries against the allowance for loan losses were thousand for  as compared to thousand for the prior year 
at year end  the allowance for loan losses  at million  represented a ratio to total loans of  down only one basis point from at the prior year end

results of operations the following analysis of net interest income  the provision for loan losses  noninterest income  noninterest expense and income taxes  highlights the factors that had the greatest impact on our results of operations for and the prior two years 
i 
net interest income tax equivalent basis net interest income represents the difference between interest  dividends and fees earned on loans  securities and other earning assets and interest paid on deposits and other sources of funds 
changes in net interest income result from changes in the level and mix of earning assets and sources of funds volume and changes in the yields earned and interest rates paid rate 
net interest margin is the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets 
net interest income may also be described as the product of average earning assets and the net interest margin 
as described in the section entitled use of non gaap financial measures on page of the report we calculate net interest income on a tax equivalent basis 
comparison of net interest income dollars in thousands tax equivalent basis years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount interest and dividend income interest expense net interest income on a tax equivalent basis  net interest income was million in  a decrease of million  or  from million in this compared to a decrease of million  or  between and factors contributing to the decrease in net interest income over the three year period are discussed in the following portions of this section bi analysis of changes in net interest income the following table presents net interest income components on a tax equivalent basis and reflects changes between periods attributable to movement in either the average daily balances or average rates for both earning assets and interest bearing liabilities

from to  we experienced a similar  although smaller  decrease in net interest income of million  as the positive impact of an increase in average net earning assets changes in volume of million was more than offset by a million negative impact of a decrease in our net interest spread and net interest margin change in rate 
our net interest spread and margin decreased by and basis points  respectively  between and  compared to decreases of and ba sis points between and generally  the following items have a major impact on changes in net interest income due to rate general interest rate changes  the ratio of our rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap during periods of interest rate changes and changes in the level of nonperforming loans 
key interest rate changes federal date funds rate prime rate june  may  march  january  december  november  september  august  june  may  march  rising rates february  december  november  september  august  june  june  november  december  november  october  september  august  june  falling rates may  april  march  january  january  may  our net interest margin has traditionally been sensitive to and impacted by changes in prevailing market interest rates 
the following analysis of the relationship between prevailing rates and our net interest margin and net interest income covers the period from to the present 
the most important recent development with regard to the effect of rate changes in our profitability is the so called flattening of the yield curve 
since the federal reserve board began increasing short term interest rates in june  the yield curve has flattened  that is  as short term rates have risen  longer term rates have stayed unchanged or decreased  with the results that the traditional spread between short term rates and long term rates the upward yield curve has almost entirely disappeared  ie  the curve has flattened 
at times during  the yield curve was even slightly inverted  with short term rates exceeding long term rates 
the flattening of the yield curve has been the most significant factor in reducing our net interest income in each of the past two years 
before  the most significant relationship between changes in prevailing market interest rates and our profitability was the traditional time lag between the repricing of our rate bearing deposit liabilities which tended to reprice quickly  and the repricing of our yielding assets  which tended to reprice more slowly 
from to  the federal reserve board decreased short term interest rates by an aggregate amount of basis points  or percent  in an irregular series of rate decreases calculated to spur consumer and business borrowing and economic activity 
the short term rate decreases ultimately triggered comparable long term rate decreases 
as a result of this multi year decrease in prevailing rates  we like other financial institutions  experienced a decrease in the cost of our deposit products in the periods 
we also experienced a decrease in the average yield in our loan portfolio during these years  although the decrease in our loan yield generally trailed  or lagged behind  our decreases in cost of deposits by three to six months resulting in higher margins and higher net interest income during the earlier portions of this declining rate period 
during and  the decrease in our deposit rates began to diminish  because rates on several of our deposit products  such as savings and now accounts  were already priced at such low levels that further significant decreases in the rates for such products was not practical or sustainable 
yields on our loan portfolio  however  continued to fall significantly in and  marking the beginning of a period of pressure on our net interest margin 
thus the decreasing rate environment had a positive impact on net interest income during and as a result of the repricing time lag  which began to fade and then disappeared entirely in and our net interest margin for the full year was  a decrease of basis points  or  from the prior year 
during the yields on earning assets fell basis points  while the cost of paying liabilities fell only basis points 
as the above table indicates  the federal reserve reversed direction in and began to increase prevailing rates with numerous successive basis point increases through june  totaling basis points 
this change in direction did not immediately impact either our cost of paying liabilities or our yield on earning assets 
by the end of  however  the increases in the target federal funds rate started to have an impact on our cost of deposits which began to rise  while our yields on assets  as expected  remained nearly flat 
our net interest margin for the fourth quarter of was  a decrease of basis points from the third quarter 
the net interest margin for the full year of was  a decrease of basis points  or  from the prior year 
during the yields on earning assets actually fell basis points  while the cost of paying liabilities fell only basis points 
through  as the federal reserve continued to make regular basis point increases to prevailing rates  we continued to experience a slight decline in the yield on our asset portfolio and then  finally  a slight upturn in the yield 
however  the yield on earning assets for all of was the same as the yield in at 
meanwhile  the cost of our paying liabilities continued to increase  over the full year 
the cost of all paying liabilities for was  an increase of basis points  or  over the prior year 
consequently  net interest margin fell from in to for  a decrease of basis points  or 
the same story played out in a steady rise in our cost of paying liabilities and a lesser rise in our yield on earning assets 
the federal reserve did not change rates after june  but maturing and new time deposits continued to reprice upward more quickly than did our maturing and new loan and investment instruments 
net interest margin for was  a decrease of basis points  or  below net interest margin for if the federal reserve continues neither to increase nor decrease prevailing rates  we expect that our net interest margin will stabilize or start to increase 
a discussion of the models we use in projecting the impact on net interest income resulting from possible changes in interest rates vis vis the repricing patterns of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is included later in this report under item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in net interest income due to volume average balances dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount earning assets interest bearing liabilities demand deposits total assets earning assets to total assets to in general  an increase in average earning assets has a positive impact on net interest income 
for  average earning assets increased million over  while average paying liabilities only increased million 
this combination led to a thousand increase in net interest income 
however  this positive effect was more than offset by the million negative effect on net interest income resulting from the changes in rates during the year  especially the squeeze in the margin  discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  an increase of million  or  in investment securities and an increase of million in the average balance of federal funds 
we experienced increases in all major categories within the loan portfolio during  although the average balance of indirect loans which represented the second largest segment of the loan portfolio was essentially flat 
indirect loans are primarily auto loans financed through local dealerships where we acquire the dealer paper 
increases in the average balances of other loan categories included i commercial and commercial real estate loans million  or  ii residential real estate loans million  or and iii other consumer loans million  or 
although average loans increased by in  this was a lower rate of in crease than the rate experienced in the only category of loans that grew faster in than in was commercial loans  which grew at an rate in versus in the million increase in average paying liabilities resulted from an million increase in time deposits  offset  in part  by a million decrease in non maturity deposit balances 
the average balance of other borrowed funds was virtually unchanged 
the change in the mix of deposit categories from non maturity to time deposits is typical during a period of rising rates 
the million of deposits acquired in the april branch acquisition accounted for a portion of the increase in average deposit balances between and  since these deposits were not included in the average balances for the first three months of the fact that average earning assets grew at a faster pace than average paying liabilities was primarily due to a million  or  increase in the average balance of non interest bearing demand deposits 
to for  average earning assets increased million over  while average paying liabilities only increased million 
this combination led to a million increase in net interest income which was more than offset by the million decrease in net interest income attributable to the changes in rates during the year  and resulting margin pressures  discussed above 
the million increase in average earning assets from to reflected an increase in average loans of million  or  offset  in part  by an million decrease in the average balance of federal funds sold and virtually no change in the average balance of investment securities 
we experienced increases in all major categories within the loan portfolio during the average balance of indirect loans increased by million  or 
increases in the average balances of other loan categories included i commercial and commercial real estate loans million  or  ii residential real estate loans million  or and iii other consumer loans million  or 
the million increase in average paying liabilities resulted from an million increase in time deposits  offset  in part  by a million decrease in non maturity deposit balances 
the average balance of other borrowed funds was virtually unchanged 
the change in the mix of deposit categories from non maturity to time deposits is typical during a period of rising rates 
the million of deposits acquired in the april branch acquisition accounted for most of the increase in average deposit balances  although we intentionally allowed some of our higher rate deposits to run off at the time of the of the acquisition to be replaced by lower rate acquired deposits 
the fact that average earning assets grew at a faster pace than average paying liabilities was primarily due to an million  or  increase in the average balance on non interest bearing demand deposits 
increases in the volume of loans and deposits  as well as yields and costs by type  are discussed later in this report under item c financial condition 
ii 
provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses we consider our accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy  given the uncertainty involved in evaluating the level of the allowance required to cover credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio  and the material effect that such judgments may have on our results of operations 
in addition to the following discussion  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
through the provision for loan losses  an allowance is maintained that reflects our best estimate of probable incurred loan losses related to specifically identified loans as well as the remaining portfolio 
actual loan losses are charged against this allowance when loans are deemed uncollectible 
we use a two step process to determine the provision for loans losses and the amount of the allowance for loan losses 
we evaluate impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over  under sfas no 
 accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan 
we evaluate the remainder of the portfolio under sfas no 
accounting for contingencies 
at december  we had one loan considered impaired and evaluated under sfas no 
that loan had sufficient collateral and required no specific reserve 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  included in item of this report 
homogenous loan pools under our sfas no 
analysis  we group loans as follows  each with its own loss rate i other commercial and commercial real estate loans  ii one to four family residential real estate loans  iii home equity loans  iv indirect loans low risk tiers  v indirect loans high risk tiers  and vi other consumer loans 
within the group of other commercial and commercial real estate loans  we sub group loans based on our internal system of risk rating  which is applied to all commercial and commercial real estate loans 
we establish loss rates for each of these pools 
furthermore  larger balance loans within the higher risk ratings are pulled out of their homogenous pools and are evaluated individually 
estimated losses  under our sfas no 
evaluation  reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of december  quantitative analysis quantitatively  we determined the historical loss rate for each homogeneous loan pool 
during the past five years we have had little charge off activity on loans secured by residential real estate 
automobile lending represents a significant component of our total loan portfolio and is the only category of loans that has a history of losses that lends itself to a trend analysis 
we have had one loss on commercial real estate loans in the past five years 
losses on commercial loans other than those secured by real estate are also historically low  but can vary widely from year to year and  this is the most complex category of loans in our loss analysis 
our net charge offs for the past five years have been at historical lows for our company 
annualized net charge offs have ranged from 
to 
of average loans during this period 
in prior years this ratio was significantly higher 
for example  in the mid to late s  the charge off ratio ranged from 
to 
for our company 
the ratio for bank holding companies in our peer group was 
at december   the most recent reporting period 
the peer group ratio was also at an historical low  ranging from 
to 
in the past five years 
qualitative analysis while historical loss experience provides a reasonable starting point for our analysis  historical losses  or even recent trends in losses  do not by themselves form a sufficient basis to determine the appropriate level for the allowance 
therefore  we also considered and adjusted historical loss factors for qualitative and environmental factors that are likely to cause credit losses associated with our existing portfolio 
these included changes in the volume and severity of past due  nonaccrual and adversely classified loans changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans changes in the value of the underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans changes in lending policies and procedures  including changes in underwriting standards and collection  charge off  and recovery practices not considered elsewhere in estimating credit losses changes in the quality of the institution s loan review system changes in the experience  ability  and depth of lending management and other relevant staff changes in international  national  regional  and local economic and business conditions and developments that affect the collectibility of the portfolio the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit  and changes in the level of such concentrations the effect of other external factors such as competition and legal and regulatory requirements on the level of estimated credit losses in the institution s existing portfolio for each homogeneous loan pool  we assigned a basis point loss factor for each of the qualitative categories  above  and for historical credit losses 
during  we did not change either the way we assign loans to pools or our risk rating methodology 
we update and change  if necessary  the loss rates assigned to various pools based on the analysis of loss trends and the change in qualitative and environmental factors 
from june to june  the federal reserve board increased prevailing short term rates in an effort to slow down national economic growth and check potential increases in the inflation rate 
in our market area  however  there was very little impact from these rate changes on unemployment rates  job growth and business failures 
although short term rates rose dramatically  long term rates held steady or even fell 
except for indirect automobile loans  interest rates for most of our borrowers are based on intermediate and long term rates  especially for residential real estate loans and for commercial loans

other income the majority of our other ie  noninterest income constitutes fee income from services  principally fees and commissions from fiduciary services  deposit account service charges  insurance commissions  computer processing fees and other recurring fee income 
net gains or losses on the sale of securities available for sale is another category of other income

at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from year end income from fiduciary activities includes income from funds under investment management in the north country funds  which include the north country equity growth fund ncegx and the north country intermediate bond fund ncbdx 
on a combined basis  these funds had a market value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
the funds were introduced in march  and are advised by our subsidiary investment adviser  north country investment advisers  inc these funds are offered on a retail basis through an arrangement with uvest financial services group  inc  a third party registered broker dealer that maintains representatives in many of our bank branches

these fees amounted to million in  an increase of thousand  or  from the increase was primarily attributable to an increase in deposit account service charges as a result of an increase in our fee structure 
we also experienced increases in referral fees from the sales of mutual funds and on our merchant bankcard activities 
in total other income included net securities losses of thousand on the sale of million of securities available for sale 
the primary purpose of the sales was to extend and restructure the maturities of certain investments with shorter remaining lives

insurance commission income for  at million  represented the first full year of income from this business 
for  insurance commission income increased thousand  or  to million 
other operating income includes net gains on the sale of loans and other real estate owned  if any  as well as other miscellaneous revenues 
for  other operating income increased thousand  or  from in  we sold  at market price  a parcel of land that we had earlier purchased to serve as premises for a new branch 
the sale resulted in a gain of thousand 
we then entered into an agreement with stewarts shops corp  the buyer  to lease from them a portion of the building they are constructing on the parcel of land to serve as our branch 
compared to total other income increased million  or  from to for  income from fiduciary activities increased thousand  or  from most of the increase reflected increases in fee levels during  although some is attributable to an increase in assets under administration and management 
at year end  the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from year end the factors that led to a higher increase in income from fiduciary activities over the increase in the market value of assets under trust administration and investment management vs 
include i an increase in the fee structure  ii a decrease in assets under trust administration and investment management at the end of due to the transfer of one commercial account as a result of a business combination  and iii the loss of a large account at the end of from which we derived a relativ ely small fee as a percentage of assets placed with us 
those assets were essentially replaced with others earning fees at our average rate 
income from fiduciary activities includes income from funds under investment management in the north country funds  which include the north country equity growth fund ncegx and the north country intermediate bond fund ncbdx 
on a combined basis  these funds had a market value of million and million at december  and  respectively

the net gains of thousand were primarily due to the fact that we were able to sell loans with yields slightly higher than those required by the secondary market 
by comparison  for  we sold only million of loans for net gains of thousand 
iv 
other expense other ie  noninterest expense is a means of measuring the delivery cost of services  products and business activities of a company 
the key components of other expense are presented in the following table 
analysis of other expense dollars in thousands years ended december  change from prior year to to amount amount salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense of premises  net furniture and equipment expense other operating expense total other expense compared to other expense for amounted to million  an increase of million  or  from one comparative measure of operating expenses for financial institutions is the efficiency ratio 
the efficiency ratio a ratio where lower is better is calculated as the ratio of other expense to the sum of tax equivalent net interest income and other income 
excluded from the calculation are intangible asset amortization and any net securities gains or losses 
the efficiency ratio might be considered a non gaap financial measure but is generally utilized by banks and bank analysts to assess an institution s performance 
see the discussion on use of non gaap financial measures on page of this report 
for  the efficiency ratio for arrow was  an increase from the ratio of 
our ratio  however  still compared favorably to the year to date ratio for our peer group of as of december  for information on the calculation of our efficiency ratios on a quarterly and annual basis  see pages and of this report 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased million  or  from to the increase in salary expense for was over  due primarily to normal merit increases and to staff increases resulting from the acquisition of new branches in april which staff increases were only included in expenses for nine months 
employee benefits increased from to this was primarily attributable to increases in health insurance and post retirement benefits 
the ratio of total personnel expense salaries and employee benefits to average assets was for  basis points less than the annualized ratio for our peer group of at december  occupancy expense increased thousand  or  from to most of the increase was attributable to increased costs for utilities and the fact that the three branches acquired in were only included in expense for nine months of furniture and equipment expense increased by thousand  or  from to other operating expense actually decreased from to  by thousand  or 
decreases in legal  advertising and supplies  related to one time expenses in for the branch acquisition  offset normal increases and fluctuations in other areas

also see the discussion on page regarding use of non gaap financial measures 
salaries and employee benefits expense increased thousand  or  from to the increase in salary expense for was over  due primarily to staff increases as result of our acquisition of three new branches in april  and our acquisition of the insurance agency in late  as well as to normal merit increases 
employee benefits actually decreased from to this was primarily attributable to decreases in incentive compensation costs 
on an annualized basis  the ratio of total personnel expense salaries and employee benefits to average assets was for  basis points less than the ratio for our peer group of at december  occupancy expense increased thousand  or  from to most of the increase was attributable to increased costs of building maintenance 
furniture and equipment expense increased by thousand  or  from to both occupancy expense and furniture and equipment expense increased as a result of the branch and insurance agency acquisitions referred to in the preceding paragraph 
other operating expense increased from to  by thousand  or 
intangible asset amortization increased thousand as a result of the branch and insurance agency acquisitions 
although all other categories of other operating expense experienced some increases from the acquisitions  the areas with the largest increases were legal  postage and supplies

investment portfolio investment securities are classified as held to maturity  trading  or available for sale  depending on the purposes for which such securities were acquired and are being held 
securities held to maturity are debt securities that the company has both the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity  such securities are stated at amortized cost 
debt and equity securities that are bought and held principally for the purpose of sale in the near term are classified as trading securities and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale and are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported net of taxes in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
at december   we held no trading securities

collateralized mortgage obligations cmos separate the repayments into two or more components tranches  where each tranche has a separate estimated life and yield 
our practice has been to purchase pass through securities and cmos guaranteed by federal agencies and tranches of cmos with shorter maturities 
included in corporate and other debt securities are highly rated corporate bonds and commercial paper

the net unrealized gain or loss on such securities  net of tax  is reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the million net unrealized loss at december  was virtually unchanged from the net unrealized loss at december  the net unrealized loss for both periods was primarily attributable to the decreased fair value of the debt securities primarily fixed rate portfolios resulting from an increase in prevailing interest rates  chiefly short term rates

loan portfolio the amounts and respective percentages of loans outstanding represented by each principal category on the dates indicated were as follows a 
types of loans dollars in thousands december  amount amount amount amount amount commercial  financial and agricultural real estate commercial real estate construction real estate residential indirect and other installment loans to individuals total loans allowance for loan losses total loans  net residential real estate loans recently  residential real estate and home equity loans have represented the largest segment of our loan portfolio 
residential mortgage demand has been moderate since  after a period in the preceding years when demand was high 
however  during and and the first quarter of  we sold many of our year  fixed rate mortgage originations  while retaining the servicing 
by the end of the first quarter of  as yields on longer term residential real estate loans began to rise  we stopped selling our year mortgage originations and decided to retain them in our portfolio 
during  the million of new residential real estate loan originations more than offset normal principal amortization on the pre existing loans in the segment and loan sales of million 
we expect that  if we continue to retain all or most originations  we will b e able to maintain the current level of residential real estate loans and may experience some continued growth 
however  if the demand for residential real estate loans decreases  due to mortgage rate increases or a softening of the real estate market or the economy generally  our portfolio also may decrease  which may negatively impact our financial performance 
indirect loans for several years prior to  indirect consumer loans consisting principally of auto loans financed through local dealerships where we acquire the dealer paper was the largest segment of our loan portfolio 
prior to mid  indirect consumer loans were the fastest growing segment of our loan portfolio  both in terms of absolute dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
in the succeeding years  this segment of the portfolio ceased to grow in absolute terms and decreased as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
this flattening of indirect loan totals was largely the result of aggressive campaigns of zero rate and other subsidized financing by auto manufacturers  commencing in the fall of during the fourth quarter of and for the first two quarters of  the indirect portfolio experienced a small amount of growth as we became more rate competitive  but the level of indirect loans was flat for the third quarter of and decreased by million during the fourth quarter of during the first half of indirect loan balances continued to decline  and then rose slightly during the second half of the year 
at the end of the first quarter of  we experienced an increase in indirect loans  which did not have a large impact on the average balance for the quarter an thousand increase from the prior quarter  but did cause the balance at period end to rise sharply to million 
we continued to experience strong demand for indirect loans throughout the second and third quarters of  for a variety of factors  including the decision by the automobile manufacturers to be less aggressive with their subsidized financing programs 
our average balances increased by million  or  from the first quarter to the second quarter of and by another million  or  in the third quarter 
in the fourth quarter of  however  indirect loan balances declined by million  or  measured at quarter end although the average balance for the fourth quarter was slightly higher than the average balance for the third qu arter 
during the first three quarters of  we elected not to compete aggressively in the indirect loan sector  in the face of a resurgence of extremely low rates being offered by automobile manufacturers  their finance affiliates and other lenders in the marketplace 
as a result  principal amortization and prepayments exceeded our originations and indirect balances decreased by million from december  to the end of the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  we saw our outstanding indirect loan balances increase modestly from the third quarter period end balance 
at december   indirect loans represent the second largest category of loans in our portfolio 
if auto manufacturers and their finance affiliates continue to market heavily subsidized financing programs  our indirect loan portfolio is likely to continue to experience rate pressure and limited  if any  overall growth 
commercial  commercial real estate and construction and land development loans we have experienced strong to moderate demand for commercial loans for the past several years  and thus commercial and commercial real estate loan balances have grown significantly  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of the overall loan portfolio 
this pattern continued during as these loan balances grew million  or  from december  substantially all commercial and commercial real estate loans in our portfolio are extended to businesses or borrowers located in our regional market 
many of the loans in the commercial portfolio have variable rates tied to prime  fhlb or us treasury indices 
the following table indicates the changing mix in our loan portfolio by including the quarterly average balances for our significant loan products for the past five quarters 
the remaining quarter by quarter tables present the percentage of total loans represented by each category and the annualized tax equivalent yield of each category 
loan portfolio quarterly average loan balances dollars in thousands quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity indirect consumer loans other consumer loans total loans percentage of total quarterly average loans quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity indirect consumer loans other consumer loans total loans quarterly tax equivalent yield on loans quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec commercial and commercial real estate residential real estate home equity indirect consumer loans other consumer loans total loans other consumer loans includes certain home improvement loans secured by mortgages 
however  these same loan balances are reported as real estate residential in the table of period end balances on the previous page  captioned types of loans 
in general  the yield tax equivalent interest income divided by average loans on our loan portfolio and other earning assets has been impacted by changes in prevailing interest rates  as previously discussed on page under the heading key interest rate changes we expect that such will continue to be the case  that is  that loan yields will continue to rise and fall with changes in prevailing market rates  although the timing and degree of responsiveness will continue to be influenced by a variety of other factors  including the makeup of the loan portfolio  consumer expectations and preferences  the rate at which the portfolio expands  and the shape of the yield curve 
additionally  there is a significant amount of cash flow from normal amortization and prepayments in all loan categories  and this cash flow reprices at current rates as new loans are generated at the current yields 
as noted in the earlier discussion  during the period of declining rates from mid to mid  we experienced a time lag between the impact of declining rates on the deposit portfolio which was felt relatively quickly and the impact on the loan portfolio which occurred more slowly 
the consequence of this particular time lag was a positive impact on the net interest margin during the beginning of the rate decline period  followed by a negative impact on the margin at the end of the rate decline period 
the net interest margin expanded during and into the first quarter of as deposit rates decreased rapidly 
our deposit rates began to flatten out in mid  while loan yields continued to decline 
as a result  the net interest margin began to contract in the second quarter of generally  this pattern persisted through the remainder of  all of and the first two quarters of  with the cost of deposits decreasing only slightly  if at all  and loan yields decreasing somewhat faster 
thus the yield on our loan portfolio decreased by basis points in the second quarter of  while the cost of our interest bearing deposits only decreased by basis points for the same period 
in mid  the federal reserve board began to raise short term rates with the first in a long series of basis point increases that did not end until june during that period  the targeted federal funds rate increased from to 
during this period of rate change  the time lag between repricing of deposits and the repricing of loan balances was especially lengthy  and although the fed s rate hikes ended in mid  the repricing upward of loan rates has not yet been completed  resulting in protracted pressures on net interest margins in the banking industry 
these pressures are further discussed above under changes in interest income due to rate beginning on page of this report 
the following table indicates the respective maturities and interest rate structure of our commercial  financial and agricultural loans and real estate construction loans at december  for purposes of determining relevant maturities  loans are assumed to mature at but not before their scheduled repayment dates as required by contractual terms 
demand loans and overdrafts are included in the within year maturity category 
all of the real estate construction loans are for single family houses where we have also made a commitment for permanent financing 
b 
maturities and sensitivities of loans to changes in interest rates in thousands within year after but within years after years total commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction total fixed interest rates variable interest rates total commitments and lines of credit stand by letters of credit represent extensions of credit granted in the normal course of business  which are not reflected in the financial statements at a given date because the commitments are not then funded 
as of december   our total contingent liability for standby letters of credit amounted to million 
in addition to these instruments  we also have issued lines of credit to customers  including home equity lines of credit  commitments for residential and commercial construction loans and other personal and commercial lines of credit  which also may be unfunded or only partially funded from time to time 
commercial lines  generally issued for a period of one year  are usually extended to provide for the working capital requirements of the borrower 
at december   we had outstanding unfunded loan commitments in the aggregate amount of approximately million 
c 
risk elements nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans the amounts of nonaccrual  past due and restructured loans for the past five years are presented in the table on page under the heading summary of the allowance and provision for loan losses 
we designate loans as nonaccrual when the payment of interest and or principal is due and unpaid for a designated period generally days or when the likelihood of the full repayment of principal and interest is  in the opinion of management  uncertain 
under the uniform retail credit classification and account management policy  established by banking regulators  fixed maturity consumer loans must generally be charged off no later than when days past due 
loans secured with non real estate collateral in the process of collection are charged down to the value of the collateral  less cost to sell 
open end credits  residential real estate loans and commercial loans are evaluated for charge off on a loan by loan basis when placed on nonaccrual status 
we had no material commitments to lend additional funds on outstanding nonaccrual loans at december  loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are those loans which were contractually past due days or more but because of expected repayments  were still accruing interest 
the balance of loans days past due totaled million at december  and represented of loans outstanding at that date  as compared to approximately million  or of loans at december  these non current loans at december  were composed of approximately million of consumer loans  principally indirect motor vehicle loans  thousand of residential real estate loans and thousand of commercial loans 
sfas no 
requires that all impaired loans  except for large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  be measured based on i the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  ii the loan s observable market price or iii the fair value of the collateral  less cost to sell  if the loan is collateral dependent 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
to all impaired commercial and commercial real estate loans over thousand  and to all restructured loans 
allowances for losses for the remaining smaller balance loans are evaluated under sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 we determine impairment for collateralized loans based on fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell 
for other loans  impairment is determined by comparing the recorded value of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows  discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
we determine the interest income recognition method for impaired loans on a loan by loan basis 
based upon the borrowers payment histories and cash flow projections  interest recognition methods include full accrual or cash basis 
during  two commercial loans were considered impaired under sfas no 
with an average recorded investment of thousand 
at year end  the balance of impaired loans consisted of one loan with a balance of thousand which had no related reserve 
at december   nonperforming loans amounted to million  an increase of thousand  or  from the balance at year end total nonperforming loans at year end represented 
of period end loans  an increase from 
at year end we do not believe that this increase represents a trend in our loan portfolio  based on current information 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to average loans for our peer group at december  was

income that would have been recognized during that period on nonaccrual loans  if such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the period or since origination if held for part of the period was thousand 
during  one commercial loan was considered impaired under sfas no 
with an average recorded investment of thousand 
at year end  the balance of the loan was thousand and had a related reserve of thousand

during  two commercial loans were considered impaired under sfas no 
with an average recorded investment of thousand 
by year end  one of these loans was fully paid off with no portion of the loan charged off leaving  at year end  one impaired loan with a balance of thousand and a related reserve of thousand

potential problem loans on at least a quarterly basis  we apply an internal credit quality rating system to commercial loans that are either past due or fully performing but exhibit certain characteristics that could reflect a potential weakness 
loans are placed on nonaccrual status when the likely amount of future principal and interest payments are expected to be less than the contractual amounts  even if such loans are not days past due 
periodically we review the loan portfolio for evidence of potential problem loans 
potential problem loans are loans that are currently performing in accordance with contractual terms  but where known information about possible credit problems of the borrower causes doubt about the ability of the borrower to comply with the loan payment terms and may result in disclosure of such loans as nonperforming at sometime in the future 
through our on going credit monitoring  we consider loans which  in our internal classification system  are classified as substandard but continue to accrue interest to be potential problem loans 
at december  we identified commercial relationships totaling million as potential problem loans 
factors such as payment history  value of supporting collateral  and personal or government guarantees led us to conclude that the current risk exposure on these loans did not warrant accounting for th e loans as nonperforming 
although in a performing status as of year end  these loans exhibited certain risk factors  which have the potential to cause them to become nonperforming at some point in the future 
the overall level of our performing loans that demonstrate characteristics of potential weakness from time to time is for the most part dependent on economic conditions in northeastern new york state 
foreign outstandings none loan concentrations the loan portfolio is well diversified 
there are no concentrations of credit that exceed of the portfolio  other than the general categories reported in the preceding section ciia of this item for further discussion  see note to the consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this report

deposits the following table sets forth the average balances of and average rates paid on deposits for the periods indicated 
average deposit balances years ended december  dollars in thousands average balance rate average balance rate average balance rate demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits during  average deposit balances increased by million  or  over the average for early in april we acquired approximately million of deposit balances in our acquisition of three branches from hsbc 
the inclusion of these acquired deposits in our average deposit balances for only part of the year  versus the entire year  would account for approximately million of the increase in average balances 
the remaining increase was generated from our pre existing branch network  and we opened a new branch in the saratoga springs area in january of during  average deposit balances increased by million  or  over the average for the acquisition of balances in the hsbc branch purchase transaction accounted for approximately million of the increase in average balances between the years 
the remaining increase was generated from our pre existing branch network 
during  average deposit balances increased by million  or  from although we opened a branch in queensbury  ny in june  nearly all of this increase in deposit balances was generated from our pre existing branch network 
no branches were purchased in we did not sell or close any branches during the covered period  the following table presents the quarterly average balance by deposit type for each of the most recent five quarters 
deposit portfolio quarterly average deposit balances dollars in thousands quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits our municipal deposit balances typically have seasonal average highs in the second and fourth quarters of the year 
for this and a variety of other reasons our banks generally experience a similar seasonality of deposits 
we typically experience little net growth measured by average deposit balances in the first quarter of the year  significant growth in the second quarter  followed by a decrease in the third quarter average balances and increasing average balances in the fourth quarter 
as part of this seasonal fluctuation  quarter end deposit balances may vary significantly from quarterly average balances 
total deposit balances for the quarters followed this seasonal pattern  that is  little if any growth in average balances during the first and third quarters and growth in the second and fourth quarters 
in the first quarter  the average balance increased by only million  or  from the fourth quarter of the modest increase was attributable to an increase in non municipal balances  offset by a decrease in municipal deposits 
in the second quarter of  following the historical trend  average deposit balances increased more rapidly  by million  or  over the first quarter level 
however  by the end of the second quarter  deposit balances had actually decreased to billion  down million from year end levels  reflecting a significant reduction in municipal deposit balances at quarter end 
for the third quarter of  the expected drop in municipal deposit balances continued through the first two months and average balances for the quarter were million  or  below the average for the second quarter 
however  by the end of the third quarter of  total deposits had risen to billion  or million above the june  period end balance 
although average balances decreased during the third quarter  they were up on a year to year basis 
the average balance of total deposits for the third quarter of exceeded the average balance for the third quarter of  by million  or 
there was  however  a significant shift from non maturity deposit products to time deposits from the quarter to the quarter  as the average rates paid by us on our deposits continued to increase over the entire period 
during the fourth quarter of  the average balance increased as expected 
particularly  the significant increases in interest bearing demand deposits and time deposits of  or more were attributable to the seasonal increase in municipal deposits 
municipal deposit balances at december  were million higher than the balance at september  the total quarterly average balances as a percentage of total deposits are illustrated in the table below 
percentage of total quarterly average deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits time deposits of  or more are to a large extent comprised of municipal deposits and are obtained on a competitive bid basis 
quarterly cost of deposits quarter ending dec sep jun mar dec demand deposits interest bearing demand deposits regular and money market savings time deposits of  or more other time deposits total deposits including non interest bearing in general  rates paid by us on various types of deposit accounts are influenced by the rates being offered or paid by our competitors  which in turn are influenced by prevailing interest rates in the economy as impacted from time to time by the actions of the federal reserve board 
there typically is a time lag between the federal reserve s actions undertaken to influence rates and the actual repricing of our deposit liabilities  although this lag is normally shorter than the lag between federal reserve actions and the repricing of our loans and other earning assets 
as a result of the federal reserve rate decreases in the through mid period  we experienced a decrease in the cost of deposits throughout the period 
the cost of deposits during the second quarter of was at its lowest point in many years 
after the federal reserve board began a protracted series of rate increases in june  our cost of deposits continued to fall in the third quarter of as maturing time deposits were still repricing at lower rates 
from the fourth quarter of through  however  our average cost of deposits increased each quarter 
we expect that this trend will moderate if the federal reserve board continues its current policy of no further rate increases  as many of our time deposits have already repriced to match current market rates

time deposits of  or more the maturities of time deposits of  or more at december  are presented below 
in thousands maturing in under three months three to six months six to twelve months total d 
liquidity our liquidity is measured by our ability to raise cash when we need it at a reasonable cost 
we must be capable of meeting expected and unexpected obligations to our customers at any time 
given the uncertain nature of customer demands as well as the need to maximize earnings  we must have available reasonably priced sources of funds  on and off balance sheet  that can be accessed quickly in time of need 
securities available for sale represent a primary source of our balance sheet cash flow 
certain investment securities are selected at purchase as available for sale based on their marketability and collateral value  as well as their yield and maturity 
our securities available for sale portfolio was million at year end maturing loans in our portfolio also represent a steady source of balance sheet cash flow 
in addition to liquidity arising from balance sheet cash flows  we have supplemented liquidity with additional off balance sheet sources such as federal funds lines of credit and credit lines with the federal home loan bank fhlb 
we have established federal funds lines of credit with three correspondent banks totaling million 
the average balance of federal funds purchased in was thousand and there was no period end balance 
we have established overnight and day term lines of credit with the fhlb  each of these lines provided for a maximum borrowing line of million at december  we borrowed only on the overnight line of credit with the fhlb during the average balance throughout was million and there was no period end balance 
if advanced  such lines of credit are collateralized by mortgage backed securities  loans and fhlb stock 
the balance in other short term borrowings at december  consisted entirely of treasury  tax and loan balances at the federal reserve bank of new york 
in addition  we have in place modest borrowing facilities from correspondent banks and also have identified wholesale and retail repurchase agreements and brokered certificates of deposit as appropriate off balance sheet sources of funding accessible in relatively short time periods 
also  glens falls national has established a borrowing facility with the federal reserve bank of new york  pledging certain consumer loans as collateral for potential discount window advances 
at december   the amount available under this facility was million  but there were no advances then outstanding 
we measure and monitor our basic liquidity as a ratio of liquid assets to short term liabilities  both with and without the availability of borrowing arrangements 
based on the level of cash flows from our investment securities portfolio  particularly mortgage backed securities  and from maturing loans in our portfolio  our stable core deposit base and our significant borrowing capacity  we believe that our liquidity is sufficient to meet any reasonably likely events or occurrences 
e 
capital resources and dividends shareholders equity was million at december   an increase of thousand  or  from the prior year end 
despite net income of million  shareholders equity increased minimally in due primarily to i cash dividends million  ii repurchases of our own common stock million and  iii the impact of adopting sfas no 
 which decreased shareholders equity million  net of tax 
in each of and  we enhanced our regulatory capital by issuing million of capital securities in private placements with institutional investors  utilizing a subsidiary delaware business trust for that purpose 
these trust preferred securities were reflected as junior subordinated obligations issued to unconsolidated subsidiary trusts on our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and these securities have certain features that make them an attractive funding vehicle 
under the federal reserve s regulatory capital guidelines discussed below  trust preferred securities may qualify as tier capital  in an amount not to exceed of tier capital  net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
both of our issues qualify as regulatory capital 
the maintenance of appropriate capital levels is a management priority 
overall capital adequacy is monitored on an ongoing basis by management and reviewed regularly by the board of directors 
our principal capital planning goal is to provide an adequate return to shareholders while retaining a sufficient base to provide for future expansion and comply with all regulatory standards 
one set of regulatory capital guidelines applicable to our holding company and subsidiary banks are the so called risk based capital measures 
under these measures  as established by federal bank regulators  the minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets is and the minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
for arrow  tier capital is comprised of common shareholders equity and the trust preferred securities issued by our two unconsolidated subsidiaries see the second previous paragraph  less intangible assets 
total capital  for this risk based capital standard  includes tier capital plus other qualifying regulatory capital  including a portion of our allowance for loan losses 
in addition to the risk based capital measures  the federal bank regulatory agencies require banks and bank holding companies to satisfy another capital guideline  the tier leverage ratio tier capital to quarterly average assets less intangible assets 
the minimum tier leverage ratio is for the most highly rated institutions 
the guidelines provide that other institutions should maintain a tier leverage ratio that is at least to higher than the minimum level for top rated institutions 
the table below sets forth the capital ratios of our holding company and subsidiary banks  glens falls national and saratoga national  as of december  capital ratios arrow gfnb snb risk based tier ratio total risk based capital ratio tier leverage ratio at december  our holding company and both banks exceeded the minimum capital ratios established by the regulatory guidelines  and qualified as well capitalized  the highest category  in the capital classification scheme set by federal bank regulatory agencies see the further discussion under supervision and regulation in part i item c of this report 
the source of funds for the payment of shareholder dividends by our holding company consists primarily of dividends declared and paid to the holding company by our bank subsidiaries 
there are various legal and regulatory limitations applicable to the payment of dividends by our bank subsidiaries 
as of december   under this statutory limitation  the maximum amount that could have been paid by the bank subsidiaries to the holding company  without special regulatory approval  was approximately million 
the ability of our holding company and our banks to pay dividends in the future is and will continue to be influenced by regulatory policies  capital guidelines and applicable laws

off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  we engage in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by us for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding

fourth quarter results we reported net income of million for the fourth quarter of  a decrease of thousand  or  from the fourth quarter of diluted earnings per common share for the fourth quarter of was  a decrease of  or  from the 
amount for the fourth quarter of the decrease in earnings was primarily attributable to the following i a thousand decrease in net interest income  ii a thousand decrease in the provision for loan losses  iii a thousand increase in other income  iv a thousand increase in other expense  and v a thousand decrease in the provision for income taxes 
the factors contributing to these quarter to quarter changes are included in the discussion of the year to year changes elsewhere in this report

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to credit risk in our loan portfolio and liquidity risk  discussed earlier  our business activities also generate market risk 
market risk is the possibility that changes in future market rates or prices will make our position less valuable 
the ongoing monitoring and management of risk is an important component of our asset liability management process  which is governed by policies that are reviewed and approved annually by the board of directors 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability oversight and control to management s asset liability committee alco 
in this capacity alco develops guidelines and strategies impacting our asset liability profile based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
we have not made use of derivatives  such as interest rate swaps  in our risk management proces s 
interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
interest rate risk is the exposure of our net interest income to changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is directly related to the different maturities and repricing characteristics of interest bearing assets and liabilities  as well as to the risk of prepayment of loans and early withdrawal of time deposits  and the fact that the speed and magnitude of responses to interest rate changes varies by product 
the alco utilizes the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also utilizes additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model attempts to capture the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all interest sensitive assets and liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheet 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth and a basis point upward and downward shift in interest rates  and a repricing of interest bearing assets and liabilities at their earliest possible repricing date 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
applying the simulation model analysis as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income  and a basis point decrease in interest rates demonstrated a decrease in net interest income 
these amounts w ere within our alco policy limits 
historically there has existed an inverse relationship between changes in prevailing rates and our net interest income  reflecting the fact that our liabilities and sources of funds generally reprice more quickly than our earning assets 
the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent a forecast on our part and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
as noted elsewhere in this report  the federal reserve board took certain actions from june through june that resulted in a basis point increase in prevailing rates 
we believe that increases in prevailing interest rates will generally have a short to medium term negative impact on our net interest margin and net interest income  which would subsequently reverse and have a positive impact on net interest margin and net interest income in ensuing years 
we believe that decreases in prevailing rates will generally have a positive impact on our margin and net interest income in the short term  but would be mitigated over the mid to longer term 
in each case  that is  in the case of increasing or decreasing rates  the slope of the yield curve and changes in the slo pe of the yield curve will also affect net interest income and the net interest margin 
we are not able to predict with certainty what the magnitude of these effects would be 
the hypothetical estimates underlying the sensitivity analysis are based upon numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of changes in interest rates including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows  and others 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurance as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will differ due to prepayment refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate changes on caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  unanticipated shifts in the yield curve and other internal external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in responding to or anticipating changes in interest rates
