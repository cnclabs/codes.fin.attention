executive overview diluted earnings per common share for were on earnings of million 
diluted earnings per common share were up and net earnings increased by as compared to net income for both and was affected by several items related to the impact of hurricane katrina  which made landfall in our region on august  in  net income was negatively affected by storm related items totaling million on an after tax basis 
the largest of s items was the establishment of a million pretax allowance for loan losses related to the storm 
in the third quarter of  we reversed million from the storm related allowance for loan losses due to better than expected loss experience with storm impacted credits 
in addition  we negotiated a final settlement with our property and casualty insurance provider and booked a million gain in s fourth quarter 
our management team continues to evaluate opportunities for growth and expansion as evidenced by our approval for a charter in the state of alabama 
strategic management of earning assets and deposit mix  continued focus on efficiency and credit quality  and improved non interest income drove the increase in operating earnings in results of operations net interest income net interest income te is the primary component of hancock s earnings and represents the difference  or spread  between revenue generated from interest earning assets and the interest expense related to funding those assets 
for internal analytical purposes  management adjusts net interest income to a taxable equivalent basis using a federal tax rate on tax exempt items primarily interest on municipal securities and loans 
fluctuations in interest rates  as well as volume and mix changes in earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can materially impact net interest income te 
another significant statistic in the analysis of net interest income is the effective interest differential also referred to as the net interest margin  which is the average of net interest earned  net interest income te less net interest expense  on hancock s average earning assets 
the difference between the average yield on earning assets and the effective rate paid for all deposits and borrowed funds  non interest bearing as well as interest bearing is the net interest spread 
since a portion of the bank s deposits does not bear interest  such as demand accounts  the rate paid for all funds is lower than the rate on interest bearing liabilities alone 
the net interest margin te for the years and was and  respectively 
net interest income te of million was recorded for the year  an increase of million  or  from we also experienced a significant increase of million  or  from to the factors contributing to the changes in net interest income te for  and are presented in tables and table is an analysis of the components of hancock s average balance sheets  levels of interest income and expense and the resulting earning asset yields and liability rates 
table breaks down the overall changes in the level of net interest income into rate and volume 
when comparing to  the primary driver of the million  or increase  in net interest income te was a  million  or  increase in average earning assets mainly from average loan growth of million  or 
hancock s loan growth and overall increase in earning assets was primarily funded by average deposit growth of  million  or 
this overall improvement in the earning asset mix enabled us to maintain our average loan to deposit ratio at for the year ended december  compared to in for the years ended december  and  loans comprise of hancock s earning asset base 
it is not uncommon for loan growth to lag deposit growth in the aftermath of a storm such as hurricane katrina in loan growth in hancock s operating region is expected to continue as inflows of insurance and federal aid funds have begun to subside 
the net interest margin te narrowed basis points as the overall increase in average earning asset yield basis points did not offset the increase in total funding costs basis points 
hancock s ability to effect continuing improvements in the earning asset mix remains a significant positive contributor to future earnings growth 
average earning assets increased  million  or  during mainly from average loan growth of million  or 
average securities increased million  or  over the increase in average earning assets was funded primarily with total average deposit growth of  million  or 
average interest bearing deposits increased million  or  while average non interest bearing deposits increased million  or resulting primarily from the aforementioned inflows of deposits related to hurricane katrina 
recognizing the importance of interest differential to total earnings  management places great emphasis on managing interest rate spreads 
although interest differential is affected by national  regional  and area economic differential through appropriate loan and investment policies 
these policies are designed to maximize interest differential while maintain sufficient liquidity and availability of funds for purposes of meeting existing commitments and for investment in loans and other investment opportunities that may arise

hancock s securities portfolio is an important source of liquidity and earnings for us 
a stated objective in managing the securities portfolio is to provide consistent liquidity to support balance sheet growth but also to provide a safe and consistent stream of earnings 
to that end  management is open to opportunities that present themselves which enables us to improve the structure and earnings potential of the securities portfolio 
during the fourth quarter  the current economic environment  the slope of the yield curve and the expectations of future interest rate movements presented hancock with an opportunity to sell million in certain us agency securities

table presents information related to nonperforming assets for the five years ended december  total nonperforming assets at december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from december  loans that are over days past due but still accruing were million at december  this compares to million at december  this increase was due primarily to accommodations granted to certain loan customers related to hurricane katrina 
in the aftermath of hurricane katrina  we recognized that many of our credit customers mostly residential mortgage holders were in a position where time would be needed to recover sufficiently from the storm before they could resume payments on their loans 
accommodations in the form of loan payment extensions most for days were granted on a customer by customer basis

net charge offs amounted to million in  as compared to million in the million decrease in net charge offs from was related primarily to decreases in the commercial and commercial real estate category 
overall  the allowance for loan losses was of non performing loans and accruing loans days past due at year end  compared to at year end management utilizes quantitative methodologies and modeling to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses and is of the opinion that the allowance at december  is adequate

deposits hancock s deposit base experienced significant growth since hurricane katrina impacted its market area 
deposits increased to billion at december  from billion at december   an increase of million  or approximately 
the year end deposit increase from to was primarily driven by non interest bearing deposit growth of million and time deposit growth of million 
total average deposits increased by million  or  from billion during to billion during over the course of  we increased our focus on multiple accounts  core deposit relationships and strategic placement of time deposit campaigns to stimulate overall deposit growth 
we continue to keep as our highest priority continued customer demand for safety and liquidity of deposit products 
interest bearing accounts  which include now accounts  money market investment accounts  savings accounts and time deposits increased more than million on an average basis during additionally  non interest bearing deposits were up almost million for the period january through december the vast majority of the aforementioned net growth occurred as a result of deposit inflows from the impact of hurricane katrina  but the inflows were not limited to the immediate aftermath of the storm 
the composition of deposit inflows since august  has been favorable to hancock s funding mix and consisted of non interest bearing demand accounts  low cost interest bearing transaction accounts and time deposits 
borrowings consist primarily of purchases of federal funds  sales of securities under repurchase agreements and borrowings from the fhlb

such instruments are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements until they are funded and involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk not reflected in the consolidated balance sheets 
the contract amounts of these instruments reflect our exposure to credit loss in the event of non performance by the other party on whose behalf the instrument has been issued 
we undertake the same credit evaluation in making commitments and conditional obligations as we do for on balance sheet instruments and may require collateral or other credit support for off balance sheet financial instruments 
at december   hancock had million in unused loan commitments outstanding  of which approximately million were at variable rates and the remainder was at fixed rates 
a commitment to extend credit is an agreement to lend to a customer as long as the conditions established in the agreement have been satisfied 
a commitment to extend credit generally has a fixed expiration date or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee by the borrower 
since commitments often expire without being fully drawn  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent our future cash requirements 
we continually evaluate each customer s credit worthiness on a case by case basis 
occasionally  a credit evaluation of a customer requesting a commitment to extend credit results in our obtaining collateral to support the obligation 
letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by hancock to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
the credit risk involved in issuing a letter of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending a loan 
at december   we had million in letters of credit issued and outstanding 
the following table shows the commitments to extend credit and letters of credit at december  according to expiration date

this credit is not reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
it will be recognized as an offset in future years against the fdic assessments 
risk management credit risk the banks primary lending focus is to provide commercial  consumer and real estate loans to consumers and to small and middle market businesses in their respective market areas 
diversification in the loan portfolio is a means of reducing the risks associated with economic fluctuations 
the banks have no significant concentrations of loans to particular borrowers or loans to any foreign entities 
loan underwriting standards reduces the impact of credit risk to us 
loans are underwritten on the basis of cash flow capacity and collateral fair value 
generally  real estate mortgage loans are made when the borrower produces sufficient cash flow capacity and equity in the property to offset historical market devaluations 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses alll is a valuation account available to absorb losses on loans 
the alll is established and maintained at an amount sufficient to cover the estimated credit loss associated with the loan and lease portfolios of the banks as of the date of the determination 
credit losses arise not only from credit risk  but also from other risks inherent in the lending process including  but not limited to  collateral risk  operational risk  concentration risk  and economic risk 
as such  all related risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
quarterly  management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably foreseeable  anticipated losses in the existing portfolio based on hancock s past loan loss and delinquency experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  and the estimated value of any underlying collateral and current economic conditions 
the analysis and methodology include three primary segments 
these segments include a pool analysis of various retail loans based upon loss history  a pool analysis of commercial and commercial real estate loans based upon loss history by loan type  and a specific reserve analysis for those loans considered impaired under sfas no 
all commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of  or greater are individually reviewed for impairment  substandard mortgage loans with balances of  or greater are also included in the analysis 
all losses are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a loss is likely to occur  recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses at the time of receipt 
commercial loans are considered impaired when it is probable the future event or events are likely to occur that the bank will be unable to collect all amounts due including principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
in order to ensure consideration of all possible impairments  for purposes of the model the banks consider all loans that are risk rated substandard as impaired 
when a loan is determined to be impaired  the amount of that impairment must be measured by either the loan s observable market price  the fair value of the collateral of the loan less liquidation costs if it is collateral dependent  or by calculating the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if the value of the impaired loan is less than the current balance of the loan  the impairment is recognized by creating a specific reserve allowance for the shortfall 
if the value is greater or equal to the loan balance  then no reserve allocation may be made for the loan 
in addition  any loans included in the impairment review should not be incorporated into the pool analysis to avoid double counting 
pool analysis is applied for all retail loans 
the retail loans are subdivided into three groups  which currently include mortgage real estate  indirect loans and direct consumer loans 
a historical loss rate is calculated for each group over the twelve prior quarters to determine the three year average loss rate 
as circumstances dictate  management will make adjustments to the loss history to reflect significant changes in the bank s loss history 
adjustments will also be made to historical loss rates to cover risks associated with trends in delinquencies  non accruals  current economic conditions and credit administration underwriting practices and policies 
a historical loss ratio is applied to all commercial loans  commercial real estate loans and leases grouped by product type for which sfas no 
exposure can best be evaluated collectively due to similar attributes 
a historical loss rate is calculated for each group over the twelve prior quarters to determine the three year average loss rate

adjustments will also be made to historical loss rates to cover risks associated with trends in delinquencies  non accruals  current economic conditions and credit administration underwriting practices and policies and borrower concentrations 
asset liability management our asset liability management alm process consists of quantifying  analyzing and controlling interest rate risk irr to maintain stability in net interest income nii under varying interest rate environments 
the principal objective of alm is to maximize net interest income while operating within acceptable limits established for interest rate risk and maintaining adequate levels of liquidity 
hancock s net earnings are dependent on our net interest income 
net interest income is susceptible to irr to the degree that interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice on a different basis and timing than interest earning assets 
this timing difference represents a potential risk to hancock s future earnings 
when interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a given period  a significant increase in market rates of interest and the subsequent impact on customer behavior could adversely affect nii 
similarly  when interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities  falling interest rates and changes in customer behavior could result in a decrease in nii 
management and the asset liability committee alco direct hancock s irr management through a risk management policy that is designed to produce a stable net interest margin nim in periods of interest rate fluctuation 
in adjusting hancock s asset liability position  the board of directors and management attempt to direct hancock s irr while enhancing the nim 
at times  depending on the general level of interest rates  the relationship between long term and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  management may determine strategies that could add to the level of irr in order to increase its nim 
not withstanding hancock s irr management activities  the potential for changing interest rates is an uncertainty that can have an adverse effect on net earnings 
to control interest rate risk  management regularly monitors the volume of interest sensitive assets compared with interest sensitive liabilities over specific time intervals 
interest sensitive assets and liabilities are those that are subject to maturity or repricing within a given time period 
management also administers this sensitivity through the development and implementation of investment  lending  funding and pricing strategies designed to achieve nii performance goals while minimizing the potential negative variations in nii under different interest rate scenarios 
investment strategies  including portfolio durations and cash flows  are formulated and continually adjusted during the implementation to assure attainment of objectives in the most effective manner 
loan and deposit pricing are adjusted weekly to reflect current interest rate and competitive market environments  with duration targets on both reviewed monthly 
the static gap report shown in table measures the net amounts of assets and liabilities that reprice within a given time period over the remaining lives of those instruments 
at december   hancock s cumulative repricing gap in the one year interval was 
the asset sensitive position represents a balance in our loan growth fixed versus floating and duration targets and the strategic management of securities portfolio cash flows and deposit mix 
management believes it is well positioned for the current rate environment 
to further control irr  we structure our loan portfolio to provide appropriate investment opportunities while minimizing potential volatility in earnings from extension risk 
deposit strategies continue to emphasize a mix of non certificate of deposit core accounts and consumer time deposits 
management believes that core deposit accounts carry a lower interest cost  and that a material portion of such accounts may be more resistant to changes in interest rates 
management further believes that mixing these accounts with targeted maturities for certificates of deposit provides the customer with a wider array of deposit opportunities while being beneficial to our duration and rate sensitivity profile 
the following table sets forth the scheduled re pricing or maturity of our assets and liabilities at december  and december  the assumed prepayment of investments and loans were based on hancock s assessment of current market conditions on such dates 
estimates have been made for the re pricing of savings  now and money market accounts 
actual prepayments and deposit withdrawals will differ from the following analysis due to variable economic circumstances and consumer behavior 
although assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or re pricing periods  reactions will vary as to timing and degree of interest rate change

table presents an analysis of hancock s irr as measured by the estimated changes in nii resulting from an instantaneous and sustained parallel shift in the yield curve at december  shifts are measured in basis point increments through basis points from base case 
base case encompasses key assumptions for asset liability mix  loan and deposit growth  pricing  prepayment speeds  deposit decay rates  securities portfolio cash flows and reinvestment strategy  and the market value of certain assets under the various interest rate scenarios 
the base case scenario assumes that the current interest rate environment is held constant throughout the forecast period  the instantaneous shocks are performed against that yield curve 
table net interest income te at risk change in estimat ed increase interest decrea se in nii rates decembe r  basis points stable most likely additionally  we have forecast a most likely nii scenario based on its conservative projection of yield curve changes for the coming month period 
this scenario utilizes all base case assumptions  applying those assumptions against a yield curve forecast that incorporates the current interest rate environment and projects certain strategic pricing changes over the forecast period 
table indicates that hancock s level of nii increases under rising rates and declines under falling rates 
the most likely scenario for interest rates projects net interest income to be relatively flat with base case falling by indicating that the balance sheet is appropriately structured for the current rate environment 
the increasing rate scenarios show increased levels of net interest income while the decreasing scenarios show higher levels of volatility and subsequently lower levels of nii 
these scenarios are instantaneous shocks that assume balance sheet management will mirror base case 
should the yield curve begin to rise or fall  management has several strategies available to maximize earnings opportunities or offset the negative impact to earnings 
for example  in a falling rate environment  deposit pricing strategies could be adjusted to further incent customer behavior to non contractual or short term less than months contractual deposit products which would reset downward with the changes in the yield curve and prevailing market rates 
another opportunity at the start of such a cycle would be reinvesting the securities portfolio cash flows into longer term  non callable bonds that would lock in higher yields 
finally  there are a number of hedge strategies by which management could use derivatives  including swaps and purchased floors  to lock in net interest margin protection  to date  management has not entered into any hedge transactions for the purpose of earnings protection 
even if interest rates change in the designated amounts  there can be no assurance that hancock s assets and liabilities would perform as anticipated 
additionally  a change in the us treasury rates in the designated amounts accompanied by a change in the shape of the us treasury yield curve would cause significantly different changes to nii than indicated above 
strategic management of hancock s balance sheet and earnings is fluid and would be adjusted to accommodate these movements 
as with any method of measuring irr  certain shortcomings are inherent in the methods of analysis presented above 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets such as adjustable rate loans have features which restrict changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
also  the ability of many borrowers to service their debt may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
we consider all of these factors in monitoring its exposure to interest rate risk 
liquidity liquidity management liquidity management encompasses the company s ability to ensure that funds are available to meet the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while also ensuring that the company has adequate cash flow to meet its various needs  including operating  strategic and capital 
without proper liquidity management  the company would not be able to perform the primary function of a financial intermediary and would not be able to meet the needs of the communities in which it has a presence and serves 
in addition  the parent holding company s principal source of liquidity is dividends from its subsidiary banks 
liquidity is required at the parent holding company level for the purpose of paying dividends to stockholders  servicing of any debt the company may have  business combinations as well as general corporate expenses 
the asset portion of the balance sheet provides liquidity primarily through loan principal repayments  maturities of investment securities and occasional sales of various assets 
short term investments such as federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell and maturing interest bearing deposits with other banks are additional sources of liquidity funding

purchases of federal funds  securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other short term borrowings are additional sources of liquidity and represent the company s incremental borrowing capacity 
these sources of liquidity are short term in nature and are used as necessary to fund asset growth and meet short term liquidity needs 
the company s short term borrowing capacity includes an approved line of credit with the federal home loan bank of million and borrowing capacity at the federal reserve s discount window in excess of million 
as of december  and  the company s core deposits were billion and billion  respectively  and net wholesale funding stood at million and million  respectively

certain critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses our most critical accounting policy relates to our allowance for loan losses  which reflects the estimated losses resulting from the inability of our borrowers to make loan payments 
if the financial condition of its borrowers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  the estimates of the allowance would be updated  and additional provisions for loan losses may be required 
the allowance for loan and lease losses alll is a valuation account available to absorb losses on loans 
the alll is established and maintained at an amount sufficient to cover the estimated credit loss associated with the loan and lease portfolios of the banks as of the date of the determination 
credit losses arise not only from credit risk  but also from other risks inherent in the lending process including  but not limited to  collateral risk  operational risk  concentration risk  and economic risk 
as such  all related risks of lending are considered when assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
quarterly  management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance is adequate to absorb reasonably foreseeable  anticipated losses in the existing portfolio based on hancock s past loan loss and delinquency experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay  and the estimated value of any underlying collateral and current economic conditions 
the analysis and methodology include three primary segments 
these segments include a pool analysis of various retail loans based upon loss history  a pool analysis of commercial and commercial real estate loans based upon loss history by loan type  and a specific reserve analysis for those loans considered impaired under sfas no 
all commercial and commercial real estate loans with an outstanding balance of  or greater are individually reviewed for impairment  substandard mortgage loans with balances of  or greater are also included in the analysis 
all losses are charged to the allowance for loan and lease losses when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a loss is likely to occur  recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses at the time of receipt 
retirement employee benefit plans retirement and employee benefit plan assets  liabilities and pension costs are determined utilizing actuarially determined present value calculations 
the valuation of the benefit obligation and net periodic expense is considered critical  as it requires management and its actuaries to make estimates regarding the amount and timing of expected cash outflows including assumptions about mortality  expected service periods  rate of compensation increases and the long term return on plan assets 
note retirement and employee benefit plans  included in the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements  provides further discussion on the accounting for hancock s retirement and employee benefit plans and the estimates used in determining the actuarial present value of the benefit obligations and the net periodic benefit expense 
fair value accounting estimates generally accepted accounting principles require the use of fair values in determining the carrying values of certain assets and liabilities  as well as for specific disclosures 
the most significant include securities  loans held for sale  mortgage servicing rights and net assets acquired in business combinations 
certain of these assets do not have a readily available market to determine fair value and require an estimate based on specific parameters 
when market prices are unavailable  hancock determines fair values utilizing parameters  which are constantly changing  including interest rates  duration  prepayment speeds and other specific conditions 
in most cases  these specific parameters require a significant amount of judgment by management

 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
this statement requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to determine period specific effects of an accounting change on one or more individual prior periods presented 
then the new accounting principle is applied to the balances of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of the earliest period for which retrospective application is practicable and that a corresponding adjustment be made to the opening balance of retained earnings for that period rather that being reported in an income statement 
further  the accounting principle is to be applied prospectively from the earliest date when it is impracticable to determine the effect to all prior periods
