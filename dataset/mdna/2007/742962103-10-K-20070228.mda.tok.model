louis  the privatebank georgia  wealth management services  and holding company activities  see operating segments results beginning on page and note operating segments to our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included on page f the profitability of our operations depends on our net interest income  provision for loan losses  non interest income  and non interest expense 
net interest income is dependent on the amount of and yields earned on  interest earning assets as compared to the amount of and rates paid on  interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is sensitive to changes in market rates of interest as well as to the execution of our asset liability management strategy 
the provision for loan losses is affected by changes in the loan portfolio  management s assessment of the collectability of the loan portfolio  loss experience  as well as economic and market factors 
non interest income consists primarily of wealth management fee revenue  mortgage banking income  bank owned life insurance and to a lesser extent  fees for ancillary banking services 
net securities gains losses and net gains losses on an interest rate swap are also included in non interest income 
critical accounting policies generally accepted accounting principles are complex and require management to apply significant judgment to various accounting  reporting and disclosure matters 
management must use assumptions 
table of contents and estimates to apply these principles where actual measurements are not possible or practical 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
reference should also be made to our significant accounting policies set out in the notes to consolidated financial statements  beginning on page f below is a discussion of our critical accounting policies 
these policies are critical because they are highly dependent upon subjective or complex judgments  assumptions and estimates 
changes in such estimates may have a significant impact on the financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management has reviewed the application of these policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors 
the accounting policies that we view as critical to us are those relating to estimates and judgments regarding the determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the estimation of the valuation of goodwill and the useful lives applied to intangible assets  and income taxes 
allowance for loan losses we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level management believes is sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is based on a review of available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships as well as probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
our allowance for loan losses is reassessed quarterly to determine the appropriate level of the allowance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses is determined based on a variety of factors  including assessment of the credit risk of the loans in the portfolio  evaluation of watch list loans  volume of loans in the portfolio  delinquent loans  impaired loans  evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area  actual charge offs and recoveries during the period and historical loss experience 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 
management adjusts the allowance for loan losses by recording a provision for loan losses in an amount sufficient to maintain the allowance at the level determined appropriate 
loans are charged off when deemed to be uncollectible by management 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was as of december   compared to at december  goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
other intangible assets represent purchased assets that also lack physical substance but can be separately distinguished from goodwill because of contractual or other legal rights or because the asset is capable of being sold or exchanged either on its own or in combination with a related contract  asset  or liability 
we perform an annual goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas no 
 which requires that goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite lives no longer be amortized but be reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if certain indicators arise 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill was being amortized using the straight line method over a period of years 
impairment losses on recorded goodwill  if any  will be recorded as operating expenses 
goodwill is pushed down to business segments at acquisition 
fair values of reporting units are determined using either discounted cash flow analyses based on internal financial forecasts or  if available  market based valuation multiples for comparable businesses 
no impairment was identified as 
table of contents a result of the testing performed during or note operating segments contains additional information regarding goodwill and the carrying values by segment 
customer intangibles acquired in connection with the acquisition of lodestar are amortized over an estimated useful life of years 
customer intangibles acquired in connection with the acquisition of the privatebank michigan are amortized over years using an accelerated method of amortization 
customer intangibles acquired in connection with the acquisition of the privatebank georgia will be amortized over years using an accelerated method of amortization 
income taxes the company is subject to the federal income tax laws of the united states  and the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions where it conducts business 
due to the complexity of these laws  taxpayers and the taxing authorities may subject these laws to different interpretations 
management must make conclusions and estimates about the application of these innately intricate laws  related regulations  and case law 
when preparing the company s tax returns  management attempts to make reasonable interpretations of the tax laws 
taxing authorities have the ability to challenge management s analysis of the tax law or any reinterpretation management makes in its ongoing assessment of facts and the developing case law 
management assesses the reasonableness of its effective tax rate quarterly based on its current estimate of net income and the applicable taxes expected for the full year 
on a quarterly basis  management also reviews circumstances and developments in tax law affecting the reasonableness of deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for contingent tax liabilities

net interest margin represents the net interest income on a tax equivalent basis as a percentage of average earning assets during the period 
net interest margin reflects the spread between average yields earned on interest earning assets and the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits and borrowings

during  total cost of funds increased by basis points from  as a result of volume increases and increases in wholesale funding costs  time deposit rates  and increased interest expense related to the million of trust preferred securities issued on june  in connection with the privatebank michigan acquisition 
the basis point increase in our cost of funds was partially offset by improvements in our yield on earnings assets  which increased by basis points during the year due primarily to increased loan volumes and increases in the prime rate  which increased basis points over the course of the year

the amount of additions to the allowance for loan losses  which is charged to earnings through the provision for loan losses  is determined based on a variety of factors  including assessment of the credit risk of the portfolio  evaluation of loans classified as special mention  sub standard and doubtful loans  delinquent loans  evaluation of other watch list credits  evaluation of current economic conditions in the market area  actual charge offs during the year  historical loss experience and industry loss averages 
the unallocated portion of the reserve involves the exercise of judgment by management and reflects various considerations  including management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses 

table of contents we maintain an allowance for loan losses sufficient to absorb credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of probable losses in the portfolio at each balance sheet date and is supported by available and relevant information 
the allowance contains provisions for probable losses that have been identified relating to specific borrowing relationships  as well as probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio and credit undertakings that are not specifically identified 
management s application of the methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses resulted in an allowance for loan losses of million at december  compared with million at december  the increase in the allowance for loan losses from december  reflects the addition of million of loan loss reserves as a result of the acquisition of the privatebank georgia  management s judgment about the comprehensive risk of real estate related lending in our various markets  the addition of new lending personnel as well as strong loan growth from all existing offices in we believe that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for estimated probable credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was at december   down from at december  net charge offs totaled  for the year ended december  versus net recoveries of  in the provision for loan losses was million for the twelve months ended december   versus million in the prior year period 
the key factors in determining the level of provision is our historical and anticipated charge off rates and an analysis of credit ratings on the loans in our portfolio

under our methodology  the allowance for loan losses is comprised of the following components allocated inherent component of the reserve the allocated portion of the allowance for loan losses is based on loan type and allocated by loan risk within each loan type 
the company assigns each of its loans a risk rating at the time of loan origination and either confirms or changes the risk rating at the time of subsequent reviews  loan renewals or upon default 
the loss allocations are based on a combination of a historical analysis of the company s losses and adjustment factors deemed relevant by management 
the adjustment factors take into account banking industry wide loss statistics  current facts and circumstances  and long term economic trends 
during the second quarter  the historical analysis was enhanced to include a five year migration analysis of the company s losses and the documentation of the loss adjustment factors was augmented 
the allocated inherent component of the reserve increased by million during  from million at december  to million at december  the increase in the allocated portion of the reserve reflects higher loan volumes in every category  particularly commercial real estate and construction loans 
specific component of the reserve for loans where management deems either the amount or the timing of the repayment to be significantly impaired  there are specific reserve allocations established 
the specific reserve is based on a loan s current value compared to the present value of its projected future cash flows  collateral value or market value  as is relevant for the particular loan pursuant to sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
as of december   the specific component of the reserve increased to  from zero at december  
table of contents unallocated inherent components of the reserve the unallocated inherent component of the reserve is based on management s review of other factors affecting the determination of probable losses inherent in the portfolio  which are not necessarily captured by the application of loss and loss adjustment factors 
this portion of the reserve analysis involves the exercise of judgment and reflects consideration such as management s view that the reserve should have a margin that recognizes the imprecision inherent in the process of estimating credit losses

nonaccrual loans are returned to an accrual status when the financial position of the borrower indicates there is no longer any reasonable doubt as to the payment of principal or interest 
other than those loans reflected in the table above  we had no significant loans for which the terms had been renegotiated or restructured  or for which there were serious doubts as to the ability of the borrower to comply with repayment terms 
potential problem loans 
in addition to those loans reflected in the table above  we have identified some loans through our problem loan identification process which exhibit a higher than normal credit risk 
loans in this category include loans with characteristics such as past maturity more than days  those that have recent adverse operating cash flow or balance sheet trends  or loans that have general risk characteristics that management believes might jeopardize the future timely collection of principal and interest payments 
the balance in this category at any reporting period can fluctuate widely based on the timing of cash collections  renegotiations and renewals

loan concentrations 
loan concentrations are considered to exist when amounts are loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar activities  which would cause them to be similarly impacted by economic or other conditions 
at december   commercial real estate loans and multi family commercial real estate loans comprised of our total loan portfolio of billion 
within this segment  loans secured by vacant land totaled million or of the total loan portfolio 
the majority of these loans have a take out commitment  a financially strong guarantor  or both 
with respect to the remaining portion of the commercial loan portfolio  there were no concentrations of loans by collateral type that exceeded of the total loan portfolio 
commercial real estate typically involves higher loan principal amounts  and the repayment of these loans generally is dependant  in large part  on the successful operation of the property securing the loan or the business conducted on the property securing the loan 
these loans may be more adversely affected by general conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy 
construction loans totaled million for of our total loan portfolio 
over of these loans were for the construction of unit residential dwellings 
we have developed long standing relationships with known builders and limit the amount of lending for speculative home building projects by developer as well as a percentage of the overall portfolio 
with few exceptions our construction lending is with recourse to the owner developer 
these loans are secured by the underlying project and the progress of the project and collateral values are closely monitored 
commercial loans of million comprise of our total loan portfolio 
these loans are to a diverse group of businesses and are mostly secured and or guaranteed 
while we consider ourselves cash flow lenders  we structure the majority of our loans with multiple sources of repayment 
due to our size and regional locations  our loans are geographically concentrated to borrowers residing in and secured by collateral located within the greater metropolitan areas of chicago  detroit  st 
louis  atlanta and milwaukee 
our geographic concentration in the chicago metropolitan area lessened from the previous year with the continued growth of the privatebank michigan and the privatebank st 
louis  which through december  included the the privatebank wisconsin  along with the acquisition of privatebank georgia 
as we seek to expand our footprint in new markets  we believe the geographic concentration will continue to lessen

at december   our total availability of overnight fed funds borrowings was million  of which we had million outstanding 
our total availability of overnight fed funds borrowings is not a committed line of credit  and is dependent upon lender availability 
in addition  we currently have available borrowing capacity of million under the million credit facilities with lasalle bank 
we utilize this credit facility from time to time for general business purposes 
impact of inflation our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto included in this report have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry 
under these principles and practices  we are required to measure our financial position in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike many industrial companies  virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general level of inflation 
over short periods of time  interest rates may not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a continuing part of our financial strategy  we attempt to manage the impact of fluctuations in market interest rates on our net interest income 
this effort entails providing a reasonable balance between interest rate risk  credit risk  liquidity risk and maintenance of yield 
asset liability management policy is established by our investment committee of our board of directors and is monitored by management 
our asset liability management policy sets standards within which we are expected to operate 
these standards include guidelines for exposure to interest rate fluctuations  liquidity  loan limits as a percentage of funding sources  exposure to correspondent banks and brokers  and reliance on non core deposits 
the policy also states our reporting requirements to our board of directors 
the investment policy complements the asset liability management policy by establishing criteria by which we may purchase securities 
these criteria include approved types of securities  brokerage sources  terms of investment  quality standards  and diversification 
one way to estimate the potential impact of interest rate changes on our income statement is a gap analysis 
the gap represents the net position of assets and liabilities subject to repricing in specified time periods 
during any given time period  if the amount of rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of rate sensitive assets  a company would generally be considered negatively gapped and would benefit from falling rates over that period of time 
conversely  a positively gapped company would generally benefit from rising rates 

table of contents we have structured our assets and liabilities to mitigate the risk of either a rising or falling interest rate environment 
we manage our gap position at the one year horizon 
depending upon our assessment of economic factors such as the magnitude and direction of projected interest rates over the short and long term  we generally operate within guidelines set by our asset liability management policy and attempt to maximize our returns within an acceptable degree of risk 
interest rate changes do not affect all categories of assets and liabilities equally or simultaneously 
there are other factors that are difficult to measure and predict that would influence the effect of interest rate fluctuations on our income statement

the simulation assumes that assets and liabilities accrue interest on their current pricing basis 
assets and liabilities then reprice based on their terms and remain at that interest rate through the end of the measurement period 
the model attempts to illustrate the potential change in net interest income if the foregoing occurred 
december  december  basis basis basis basis basis basis basis basis points points points points points points points points percentage change in net interest income due to an immediate and basis point change in interest rates over a one year time horizon this table shows that if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of basis points on december   net interest income would increase by over a one year period  as compared to a net interest income increase of if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift of basis points at december  the measurement of a basis point instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve at december  would result in an increase in net interest income of over a one year period as compared to measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
at december   if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of

at december   if there had been an instantaneous parallel shift in the yield curve of  we would have suffered a decline in net interest income of  as compared to a decline measured on the basis of the december  portfolio 
changes in the effect on net interest income from a and basis point movement at december   compared to december  are due to the timing and nature of the repricing of rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities within the one year time frame 
the table presented above reflects that the company is less interest rate sensitive at december  as compared to december  the primary factor contributing to the company becoming less asset sensitive in  is the shorter duration of the company s borrowed funds at december  as compared to december  there are several factors contributing to the duration of borrowed funds shortening  including our decision to increase the level of our federal funds purchased 
the company also continues to draw on it s line of credit facilities during these lines charge interest based upon floating rate indices  further shortening our funding duration 
the preceding sensitivity analysis is based on numerous assumptions including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including the shape of the yield curve  prepayments on loans and securities  changes in deposit levels  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment replacement of asset and liability cash flows and others 
while our assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  we cannot make any assurances as to the predictive nature of these assumptions including how client preferences or competitor influences might change 
we continue to monitor our gap and rate shock reports to detect changes to our exposure to fluctuating rates 
we have the ability to shorten or lengthen maturities on newly acquired assets  sell investment securities  or seek funding sources with different maturities in order to change our asset and liability structure for the purpose of mitigating the effect of interest rate risk
