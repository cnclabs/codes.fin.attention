for a description of the forward looking statements and risk factors that may affect our performance  see the risk factors section above 
additionally  for an understanding of the significant factors that influenced our performance during the past three years  the following should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes 
overview libbey is the leading producer of glass tableware products in the western hemisphere  in addition to supplying to key markets throughout the world 
with libbey s roots dating back to  we have the largest manufacturing  distribution and service network among north american glass tableware manufacturers 
we design and market an extensive line of high quality glass tableware  ceramic dinnerware  metal flatware  hollowware and serveware  and plastic items to a broad group of customers in the foodservice  retail  business to business and industrial markets 
we own and operate two glass tableware manufacturing plants in the united states as well as glass tableware manufacturing plants in the netherlands  portugal  china and mexico 
we also own and operate a ceramic dinnerware plant in new york and a plastics plant in wisconsin 
in addition  we import products from overseas in order to complement our line of manufactured items 
the combination of manufacturing and procurement allows us to compete in the global tableware market by offering an extensive product line at competitive prices 
during  we undertook several key strategic initiatives on june   we purchased the remaining percent of crisa that we did not previously own 
crisa is the largest glass tableware manufacturer in latin america and has percentage of the glass tableware market in mexico 
in june  we closed a private offering of million senior secured notes and million senior subordinated secured pay in kind notes 
concurrently  we entered into a new million asset based loan facility abl facility 
we used the proceeds from these financings to purchase the remaining percent equity interest in crisa  to repay substantially all existing indebtedness of libbey and crisa  and to pay related fees  expenses and redemption premiums 
in june  we announced plans to consolidate crisa s two principal manufacturing facilities into a single facility in order to reduce fixed costs 
in connection with this consolidation  we recognized special charges of approximately million 
we expect to realize annual cost savings of to million associated with the consolidation starting mid we completed the construction of our new production facility in china 
we began production at the facility in early  and in early april we expect to begin customer shipments of products produced at that facility

special charges over the past few years we have undertaken several initiatives to reduce our future cost profile and  as a result  we have incurred one time special charges that have been reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the following is a summary of these initiatives see note for further information in june  we announced plans to consolidate crisa s two principal manufacturing facilities into one facility 
these charges were reflected in in the amount of million 
in the second quarter of  we announced a ten percent reduction in our north american salaried workforce 
these charges were primarily reflected in in the amount of million 
in august  we announced that we were realigning our domestic glass tableware production capacity by closing our city of industry  california manufacturing facility 
these charges were primarily reflected in and in the amount of million and million  respectively 
in addition to these special charges  we also have incurred the following one time charges see note for further information in june  we incurred a pretax charge of million relating to the write off of unamortized finance fees on the debt of libbey and crisa that we refinanced

discussion of vs 
cash flow net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in  compared to million in the increase is primarily related to an increase in ebitda  excluding special charges  and a reduction in working capital 
other factors impacting the calculation of cash flow were an increase in non cash pension and nonpension postretirement expense and a decrease in non cash workers compensation expense 
free cash flow was million in  compared to million in  a decrease of million 
this decline is mainly attributable to the increase in net cash provided by operating activities offset by an increase in capital expenditures including million for the construction of our new facility in china and the crisa acquisition of million

derivatives we have interest rate protection agreements rate agreements with respect to million of debt as a means to manage our exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
the rate agreements effectively convert this portion of our long term borrowings from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future income 
the fixed interest rate for our borrowings related to the rate agreements at december   excluding applicable fees  is percent per year and the total interest rate  including applicable fees  is percent per year 
the average maturity of these rate agreements is years at december  total remaining debt not covered by the rate agreements has fluctuating interest rates with a weighted average rate of percent per year at december  the fair market value for the rate agreements at december   was million 
we also use commodity futures contracts related to forecasted future us natural gas requirements 
the objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid and potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse price movements in the underlying commodity 
we consider our forecasted natural gas requirements in determining the quantity of natural gas to hedge 
we combine the forecasts with historical observations to establish the percentage of forecast eligible to be hedged  typically ranging from to of our anticipated requirements  generally six or more months in the future 
the fair values of these instruments are determined from market quotes 
at december   we had commodity futures contracts for  million british thermal units btu s of natural gas with a fair market value of million 
we have hedged forecasted transactions through march at december   we had commodity futures contracts for  million btu s of natural gas with a fair market value of million 
share repurchase program since mid  we have repurchased  shares for million  as authorized by our board of directors 
as of december   authorization remains for the purchase of an additional  shares 
during and  we did not repurchase any common stock 
our abl facility and the indentures governing the senior secured notes and the pik notes significantly restrict our ability to repurchase additional shares 
we are using a portion of the repurchased common stock to fund our employee stock benefit plans

off balance sheet arrangements we were a joint venture partner in vitrocrisa holding  s 
de rl de cv and related companies crisa  the largest glass tableware manufacturer in latin america  through june  on june   we purchased the remaining percent equity interest in crisa see note to the consolidated financial statements 
through june   we recorded our percent interest in crisa using the equity method of accounting 
from this joint venture  we recorded equity earnings loss  dividends and certain technical assistance income 
we also had a reciprocal distribution agreement with our joint venture partner that gave us exclusive distribution rights with respect to crisa s glass tableware products in the us and canada  and gave crisa the exclusive distribution rights with respect to our glass tableware products in latin america 
in addition  we guaranteed a portion of crisa s bank debt see note to the consolidated financial statements 
while we owned percent of crisa  we evaluated this investment and related arrangements in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r and determined that crisa was a variable interest entity vie  as defined by fin r  however  we were not considered the primary beneficiary  as we did not absorb the majority of expected losses or received the majority of expected residual returns 
therefore  crisa was not consolidated in our consolidated financial statements through june  since we acquired the remaining percent of crisa on june   we have consolidated crisa s financial statements 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements for disclosure regarding financial information relating to crisa 
capital resources and liquidity based on our current level of operations  we believe our cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our abl facility will be adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months 
our ability to fund our working capital needs  debt payments and other obligations  capital expenditures program and other funding requirements  and to comply with debt agreements  depends on our future operating performance and cash flow see part ii  item a

note to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in their preparation 
the areas described below are affected by critical accounting estimates and are impacted significantly by judgments and assumptions in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when products are shipped and title and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
revenue is recorded net of returns  discounts and sales incentive programs offered to customers 
we offer our various incentive programs to a broad base of customers and we record accruals for these as sales occur 
these programs typically offer incentives for purchase activities by customers that include growth objectives 
criteria for payment include the achievement by customers of certain purchase targets and the purchase by customers of particular product types 
management regularly reviews the adequacy of the accruals based on current customer purchases  targeted purchases and payout levels 
allowance for doubtful accounts our accounts receivable balance  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  was million in  compared to million in the allowance for doubtful accounts was million in  compared to million in the allowance increase in compared to is mainly attributable to allowances at crisa 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is established through charges to the provision for bad debts 
we regularly evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical trends in collections and write offs  our judgment as to the probability of collecting accounts and our evaluation of business risk 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to revision as more information becomes available 
accounts are determined to be uncollectible when the debt is deemed to be worthless or only recoverable in part and are written off at that time through a charge against the allowance 
allowance for slow moving and obsolete inventory we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories and estimate appropriate allowance provisions accordingly 
we provide inventory allowances based upon excess and obsolete inventories driven primarily by future demand forecasts 
historically  these loss provisions have not been significant  as a significant percentage of our inventories is valued using the last in  first out lifo method 
at december   our inventories were million  with loss provisions of million  compared to inventories of million and loss provisions of million at december  the allowance increase in compared to is mainly attributable to allowances at crisa 
asset impairment fixed assets we review fixed assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
determining whether impairment has occurred typically requires various estimates and assumptions 
in  we wrote down certain assets to fair value at our syracuse china facility based upon appraisals performed by an independent third party 
in  due to the closure of our facility in city of industry  california  we wrote down the values of certain assets based upon appraisals performed by an independent third party 
these write downs are further disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets goodwill impairment tests are completed for each reporting unit on an annual basis  or more frequently in certain circumstances where impairment indicators arise 
when performing our test for impairment  we use the discounted cash flow method  which incorporates the weighted average cost of capital of a hypothetical third party buyer to compute the fair value of each reporting unit 
the fair value is then compared to the carrying value 
to the extent that fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
this was done as of october st for each year presented 
our review indicated an impairment of goodwill of million at our syracuse china facility during this impairment is further disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
individual indefinite life intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently in certain circumstances where impairment indicators arise 
when performing our test for impairment  we use the discounted cash flow method to compute the fair value  which is then compared to the carrying value of the indefinite life intangible asset 
to the extent that fair value exceeds the carrying value  no impairment exists 
this was done as of october for each year presented 
an impairment loss for intangible assets of million was recorded in for our syracuse china facility 
this impairment is further disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
if the company s projected future cash flows were lower  or if the assumed weighted average cost of capital were higher  the testing performed as of october   may have indicated an impairment of one or more of the company s other reporting units and  as a result  the related goodwill would also have been impaired 
as of october   the excess of fair value of the crisal reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by approximately million 
self insurance reserves we use self insurance mechanisms to provide for potential liabilities related to workers compensation and employee health care benefits that are not covered by third party insurance 
workers compensation accruals are recorded at the estimated ultimate payout amounts received from our third party administrator based on individual case estimates 
in addition  we record estimates of incurred but not reported losses as developed by an independent third party actuary 
group health accruals include estimates of incurred but not reported estimates received from our third party administrator of the plan 
although we believe that the estimated liabilities for self insurance are adequate  the estimates described above may not be indicative of current and future losses 
in addition  the actuarial calculations used to estimate self insurance liabilities are based on numerous assumptions  some of which are subjective 
we will continue to adjust our estimated liabilities for self insurance  as deemed necessary  in the event that future loss experience differs from historical loss patterns 
pension assumptions the following are the assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and pretax income effect for our pension plan benefits for  and us plans us plans year ended december  discount rate to to expected long term rate of return on plan assets rate of compensation increase to to to to to two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  are important elements of plan expense and asset liability measurement 
we evaluate these critical assumptions on our annual measurement date of december other assumptions involving demographic factors such as retirement age  mortality and turnover are evaluated periodically and are updated to reflect our experience 
actual results in any given year often will differ from actuarial assumptions because of demographic  economic and other factors 
the discount rate enables us to estimate the present value of expected future cash flows on the measurement date 
the rate used reflects a rate of return on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected benefit payments at our december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
to determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  we consider the current and expected asset allocations  as well as historical and expected returns on various categories of plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets at december is used to measure the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
sensitivity to changes in key assumptions is as follows a change of percent in the discount rate would change our total pension expense by approximately million 
a change of percent in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change total pension expense by approximately million based on year end data 
nonpension postretirement assumptions we use various actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected trend in health care costs  to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree welfare plan 
the discount rate is determined based on high quality fixed income investments that match the duration of expected retiree medical benefits at our december measurement date 
the discount rate at december is used to measure the year end benefit obligations and the earnings effects for the subsequent year 
the following are the actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and pretax income effect for our nonpension postretirement benefits us plans us plans year ended december  discount rate initial health care trend ultimate health care trend years to reach ultimate trend rate sensitivity to changes in key assumptions is as follows a percent change in the discount rate would change the nonpension postretirement expense by million 
a percent change in the health care trend rate would not have a material impact upon the nonpension postretirement expense 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the us and certain foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes 
during the ordinary course of business  there are many transactions and calculations as to which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we establish reserves for tax related uncertainties based on estimates of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes and interest will be due 
these reserves are established when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit and the expiration of a statute of limitation 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and tax attribute carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
fas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a valuation allowance be recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined separately for each tax jurisdiction in which the company conducts its operations or otherwise incurs taxable income or losses 
in the united states  the company has recorded deferred tax assets  the largest of which relate to pension and nonpension postretirement benefits 
the deferred tax assets are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities  the most significant of which relate to accelerated depreciation 
losses before income taxes have been incurred in recent years  and though the risk of not realizing the deferred tax asset exists  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will be realized through loss carry backs and the effects of tax planning 
derivatives and hedging we use derivatives to manage a variety of risks  including risks related to interest rates and commodity prices 
accounting for derivatives as hedges requires that  at inception and over the term of the arrangement  the hedged item and related derivative meet the requirements for hedge accounting 
the rules and interpretations related to derivatives accounting are complex 
failure to apply this complex guidance will result in all changes in the fair value of the derivative being reported in earnings  without regard to the offsetting in the fair value of the hedged item 
the accompanying financial statements reflect consequences of loss hedge accounting for certain positions 
in evaluating whether a particular relationship qualifies for hedge accounting  we first determine whether the relationship meets the strict criteria to qualify for exemption from ongoing effectiveness testing 
for a relationship that does not meet these criteria  we test effectiveness at inception and quarterly thereafter by determining whether changes in the fair value of the derivative offset  within a specified range  changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
if the fair value changes fail this test  we discontinue applying hedge accounting to that relationship prospectively 
stock based compensation expense on january   we adopted sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees and directors 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for fiscal was million 
upon adoption of sfas r  we began estimating the value of employee share based compensation on the date of grant using the black scholes model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the value of each employee share based compensation unit was estimated on the date of grant using this same model for the purpose of the pro forma financial information provided in accordance with sfas the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the award  and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
the use of the black scholes model requires extensive actual employee exercise behavior data and a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  risk free interest rate interest rate  and expected dividends

new accounting standards in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin no 

fin no 
is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period for the first fiscal year beginning on or after december  fin clarified the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin no 
applies to all tax positions for income taxes accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we plan to adopt fin no 
effective for the first quarter of the calendar year ended december  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and are not yet in a position to determine such effects 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this statement clarifies how to measure fair value as permitted under other accounting pronouncements but does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some companies  the application of this statement will change current practice 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
as of january  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition and are not yet in a position to determine such effects 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk currency we are exposed to market risks due to changes in currency values  although the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in the us dollar 
the currency market risks include devaluations and other major currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar  euro  rmb or mexican peso that could reduce the cost competitiveness of our products compared to foreign competition 
interest rates we are exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates on our floating debt and have entered into interest rate protection agreements rate agreements with respect to million of debt as a means to manage our exposure to fluctuating interest rates 
the rate agreements effectively convert a portion of our long term borrowings from variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future income 
we had million of debt subject to fluctuating interest rates at december  a change of one percentage point in such rates would result in a change in interest expense of approximately million on an annual basis 
if the counterparties to these rate agreements were to fail to perform  we would no longer be protected from interest rate fluctuations by these rate agreements 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties 
natural gas we are also exposed to market risks associated with changes in the price of natural gas 
we use commodity futures contracts related to forecasted future natural gas requirements of our manufacturing operations 
the objective of these futures contracts is to limit the fluctuations in prices paid and potential losses in earnings or cash flows from adverse price movements in the underlying natural gas commodity 
we consider the forecasted natural gas requirements of our manufacturing operations in determining the quantity of natural gas to hedge 
we combine the forecasts with historical observations to establish the percentage of forecast eligible to be hedged  typically ranging from percent to percent of our anticipated requirements  generally six or more months in the future 
for our natural gas requirements that are not hedged  we are subject to changes in the price of natural gas  which affect our earnings 
if the counter parties to these futures contracts were to fail to perform  we would no longer be protected from natural gas fluctuations by the futures contracts 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by these counter parties 
retirement plans we are exposed to market risks associated with changes in the various capital markets 
changes in long term interest rates affect the discount rate that is used to measure our benefit obligations and related expense 
changes in the equity and debt securities markets affect the performance of our pension plans asset performance and related pension expense 
sensitivity to these key market risk factors is as follows a change of percent in the discount rate would change our total expense by approximately million 
a change of percent in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change total pension expense by approximately million
