all operating groups are growth oriented  ethical businesses  focused on environmental responsibility and the health and well being of its communities 
within the sunopta food group  the grains and foods group represents the foundation of the group and specializes in bringing a number of identity preserved  non genetically modified and organic grains and related agronomic services to market with a core focus in soy  sunflower  corn and rice

the management s discussion and analysis md a  detailed below  is presented in five parts  critical accounting estimates  results of operations for versus and versus  recent accounting developments  liquidity and capital resources  business and financial outlook and risks and uncertainties  and should be read in conjunction with the december  consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
sunopta inc december  k critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  related revenues and expenses  and disclosure of gain and loss contingencies at the date of the financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions made require judgment on the part of management and are based on the company s historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable in the circumstances 
management continually evaluates the information that forms the basis of its estimates and assumptions as the business of the company and the business environment generally changes 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the company s financial statements 
the following are the accounting estimates which management believes to be most important to the business of the company 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue at the time of delivery of the product or service and when all of the following have occurred a sales agreement is in place  price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
details of specific recognition by group are as follows i sunopta food group grain revenues are recorded when title and possession of the product is transferred to the customer 
possession is transferred to the customer at the time of shipment from our facility or at the time of delivery to a specified destination depending on the terms of the sale 
revenues from custom processing services are recorded upon provision of services and completion of quality testing 
all other food group revenues are recognized when title is transferred upon the shipment of product or at the time the service is provided to the customer 
ii opta minerals group revenues from the sale of silica free loose abrasives  industrial minerals  specialty sands and related products are recognized upon the sale and shipment of the related minerals 
iii sunopta bioprocess group the percentage of completion method is used to account for significant contracts when related costs can be reasonably estimated 
the company uses costs or hours incurred to date as a percentage of total expected costs or hours to measure the extent of progress towards completion 
license fees related to the right to sell the company s technologies are recorded as revenues over the term of the license  when collectibility is reasonably assured 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable primarily includes amounts due from its customers 
the carrying value of each account is carefully monitored with a view to assessing the likelihood of collection 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is provided for as an estimate of losses that could result from customers defaulting on their obligation to the company 
in assessing the amount of reserve required  a number of factors are considered including the age of the account  the credit worthiness of the customer  payment terms  the customer s historical payment history and general economic conditions 
because the amount of the reserve is an estimate  the actual amount collected could differ from the carrying value of the amount receivable 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
sunopta inc december  k inventory inventory is the company s largest current asset 
the company s inventory consists primarily of raw materials and finished goods held for sale 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost  valued on a first in  first out basis  or estimate net realizable value except certain grain inventories that are carried at market value 
sunopta assesses the net realizable value of its inventory on a regular basis by reviewing  on an item by item basis  the realizable value of its inventory  net of anticipated selling costs 
if it is management s judgment that the selling price of an item must be lowered below its cost in order for it to be sold  then the carrying value of the related inventory is written down to the net realizable value 
a number of factors would be taken into consideration in assessing the net realizable value including the quantity on hand  age and expiration  historical sales  consumer demand and preferences 
depending on market conditions  the actual amount received on sale could differ from management s estimate 
during the year  the company adopted fas amends arb  chapter to clarify that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted materials spoilage should be recognized as current period charges 
in addition  fas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the cost of conversion be based on the normal capacity of production facilities 
as required by fas  the company adopted this new accounting standard on january  the adoption of fas has not had a material impact on the company s financial statements 
prepaid and other current assets prepaid and other current assets include amounts paid in cash and recorded as a current asset prior to consumption by the company 
the balance also includes advances to growers required to secure future delivery of product totalling  
impairment testing of goodwill with the implementation of statement of financial accounting standard sfas in  goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life are no longer amortized  but instead are tested at least annually for impairment 
any impairment loss is recognized in income 
we have goodwill of  as at december  in accordance with sfas  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on a reporting unit basis 
reporting units are operating segments or components of operating segments for which discrete financial information is available 
the evaluation of goodwill for each reporting unit is based upon the following approach 
we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
where the carrying value is greater than the fair value  the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit with any of the remainder being allocated to goodwill 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill is then compared to the carrying value of that goodwill to determine the impairment loss 
we measure the fair value of reporting units using discounted future cash flows 
because the business is assumed to continue in perpetuity  the discounted future cash flow includes a terminal value 
the long term growth assumptions incorporated into the discounted cash flow calculation reflect our long term view of the market and the discount rate is based on our weighted average cost of capital 
each year we re evaluate the assumptions used to reflect changes in the business environment 
based on the evaluation performed this year  we determined that the fair values of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value and that as a result the second step of the impairment test was not required 
in the company impaired goodwill and a trademark in the amount of  primarily due to the exit of certain businesses 
in the company impaired trademarks with a pre tax value of  relating to the acquisition of first light foods in sunopta inc december  k intangible assets intangible assets consist principally of customer relationships and trademarks that arise from acquisitions  which amounted to  at december  customer relationships  trademarks and other intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis for the period over which we expect to receive economic benefits 
purchase price allocation business acquisitions are accounted for by the purchase method of accounting 
under this method  the purchase price is allocated to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on the fair value at the time of the acquisition 
the excess purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is goodwill 
the assumptions and estimates with respect to determining the fair value of intangible assets acquired generally requires the most judgment  and include estimates of future profitability  income tax rates and discount rates 
changes in any of the assumptions or estimates used in determining the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities could impact the amounts assigned to assets  liabilities  and goodwill in the purchase price allocation 
future net earnings can be affected as a result of changes in these estimates resulting in an asset or goodwill impairment 
accrued expenses and other assets the company is constantly required to make estimates of future payments that will be made and received which relate to current and future accounting periods 
these estimates cover items such as accrued but unpaid wages and bonuses  estimates of capital taxes and estimates of amounts receivable under legal suits 
in establishing appropriate accruals and receivable balances  management must make judgements regarding the amount of the disbursement or receipts that will ultimately be incurred or received 
in making such assessments  management uses historical experience as well as any other special circumstances surrounding a particular item 
the actual amount paid or received could differ from management s estimate 
income taxes the company is liable for income taxes in the united states and canada 
in making an estimate of its income tax liability the company must first make an assessment of which items of income and expense are taxable in a particular jurisdiction 
this process involves a determination of the amount of taxes currently payable as well as the assessment of the effect of temporary timing differences resulting from different treatment of items for accounting and tax purposes 
these differences in the timing of the recognition of income or the deductibility of expenses result in deferred income tax balances that are recorded as assets or liabilities as the case may be on the company s balance sheet 
the company also makes an estimate on the amount of valuation allowance to maintain relating to loss carry forwards and other balances that can be used to reduce future taxes payable 
management assesses the likelihood of the ultimate realization of these tax assets by looking at the relative size of the tax assets in relation to the profitability of the businesses and the jurisdiction to which they can be applied to  the number of years based on management s estimate it will take to use the tax assets and any other special circumstances 
if different judgements had been used  the company s income tax liability could have been different from the amount recorded 
in addition  the taxing authorities of those jurisdictions upon audit may not agree with the company s assessment 
note of the consolidated financial statements provides an analysis of the movements in the valuation allowance 
stock compensation the company maintains several stock option plans under which incentive stock options may be granted to employees and non employee directors 
the company had previously adopted the fair value measurement provisions of sfas no 
which required the note disclosure of the company s earnings as if stock compensation was recorded 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  stock based compensation  using the modified prospective transition method which requires the company to record stock based compensation expenses within the statement of earnings 
as required by the standard the company has presented the prior year proforma note disclosure for stock based compensation 
sunopta inc december  k net earnings for the year ended december  includes  of compensation expense related to our stock based compensation arrangements including  in stock based compensation for the employees of opta minerals inc net earnings for the year ended december  included nil of stock based compensation  however  in accordance with the proforma note disclosure requirements of fas the company would have reported a pre tax expense of  including the impact of accelerated vesting of certain options 
the company also realized a cash tax benefit of  relating to options granted in prior years and exercised in the current year 
the benefit was recorded as an increase to contributed surplus 
the proforma net earnings have been restated from prior years to reflect the fact that stock compensation expense relating to the company s us employees is tax deductible 
the impact of this restatement was to reduce the proforma stock compensation expense to  in and  in from  and  as a result  proforma net earnings has been restated to  in and  in and proforma eps is now and compared to for and in

sunopta inc december  k item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal and limit risk 
to achieve this objective  the company maintains its portfolio in a variety of securities  including both government and corporate obligations and money market funds 
these securities are generally classified as cash and cash equivalents or short term investments and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported through profit and loss 
as at december  all of sunopta s excess funds were held in cash and cash equivalents with a maturity less than days 
debt in both fixed rate and floating rate interest carry different types of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt may have their fair market value adversely affected by a decline in interest rates 
in general  longer date debts are subject to greater interest rate risk than shorter dated securities 
floating rate term debt gives less predictability to cash flows as interest rates change 
as at december   the weighted average interest rate of the fixed rate term debt was and   of the company s outstanding term debt is at fixed interest rates 
variable rate term debt of   at an interest rate of is partially hedged by variable rate cash equivalent investments 
the company looks at various factors to determine the percentage of debt to hold at fixed rates including  the interest rate spread between variable and fixed swap rates  the company s view on interest rate trends  the percent of offset to variable rate debt through holding variable rate investments and the company s ability to manage with interest rate volatility and uncertainty 
for every increase decrease in interest rates the company s after tax earnings would decrease increase by approximately foreign currency risk all us subsidiaries use the us dollar as their functional currency and the united states dollar is also the company s reporting currency 
the company is exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the company and its canadian subsidiaries are translated into us dollars on consolidation 
during the canadian dollar depreciated slightly against the us dollar with closing rates moving from cdn at december  to cdn at december  for each us dollar 
the us dollar also depreciated against the euro 
the net effect of this depreciation has been an exchange loss including losses included in comprehensive income of  gain of 
during the year the company had a   increase in net canadian assets 
a movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates in favour of against the canadian dollar with all other variables held constant would result in an increase decrease in the fair value of the company s net canadian assets by  
the functional currency of all operations  located in canada  is the canadian dollar 
for these operations all transaction gains or losses in relation to the us dollar are recorded as foreign exchange gain loss in the consolidated statement of earnings while gains losses on translation of net assets to us dollars on consolidation are recorded in the currency translation adjustment account within shareholders equity 
the functional currency of the corporate head office is the canadian dollar 
transaction gains or losses as well as translation gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities are recorded within foreign exchange gains losses on the consolidated statement of earnings 
us based food group operations have limited exposure to other currencies since almost all sales and purchases are made in us dollars 
it is the company s intention to hold excess funds in the currency in which the funds are likely to be used  which will from time to time potentially expose the company to exchange rate fluctuations when converted into us dollars 
commodity risk the food group enters into exchange traded commodity futures and options contracts to hedge its exposure to price fluctuations on grain transactions to the extent considered practicable for minimizing risk from market price fluctuations 
futures contracts used for hedging purposes are purchased and sold through regulated commodity exchanges 
inventories  however  may not be completely hedged  due in part to the company s assessment of its exposure from expected price fluctuations 
exchange purchase and sales contracts may expose the company to risk in the event that a counter party to a transaction is unable to fulfill its contractual obligation 
the company manages its risk by entering into purchase contracts with pre approved producers 
sunopta inc december  k the company has a risk of loss from hedge activity if a grower does not deliver the grain as scheduled 
sales contracts are entered into with organizations of acceptable creditworthiness  as internally evaluated 
all futures transactions are marked to market 
gains and losses on futures transactions related to grain inventories are included in cost of goods sold 
at december  the company owned   bushels of corn with a weighted average price of and   bushels of soy beans with a weighted average price of 
the company has at december  net long short positions on soy beans of   and a net long short position on corn of   bushels 
an increase decrease in commodity prices of either soy or corn of would not be material to the company 
there are no futures contracts in the other sunopta food group segments  opta minerals  the bio process group or related to corporate office activities
