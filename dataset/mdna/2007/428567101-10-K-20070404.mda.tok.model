item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview hibbett sports  inc is a rapidly growing operator of sporting goods stores in small to mid sized markets predominantly in the sunbelt  mid atlantic and midwest 
our stores offer a broad assortment of quality athletic equipment  footwear and apparel with a high level of customer service 
as of february  we operated a total of retail stores composed of hibbett sports stores  sports additions athletic shoe stores and sports co 
superstores in states 
our primary retail format and growth vehicle is hibbett sports  a  square foot store located in strip centers which are generally the centers of commerce within the area and which are usually anchored by a wal mart store and in enclosed malls 
over the last few years  we have concentrated and expect to continue our store base growth in strip centers versus enclosed malls as the centers are more prominent in the markets we target 
we believe hibbett sports stores are typically the primary sporting goods retailers in their markets due to the extensive selection of traditional team merchandise and a high level of customer service 
we do not expect that the average size of our stores opening in fiscal will vary significantly from the average size of stores opened in fiscal we historically have comparable store sales in the low to mid single digit range and we plan to increase total company wide square footage by approximately in fiscal year we believe total sales percentage growth will be in the mid teens in fiscal over the past several years  we have increased our product margin due to improved vendor discounts  fewer retail reductions  increased efficiencies in logistics and favorable leveraging of store occupancy costs 
we expect gross profit to increase to basis points in fiscal attributable to vendor leveraging and continued improvement of inventory turns 
due to our increased sales  we have historically leveraged our store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
with our expected sales increase  we expect operating  selling and administrative expenses to increase somewhat in fiscal primarily due to the movement of certain stock option expense into fiscal  the new store cost related to approximately additional new stores over fiscal and the start up costs related to the second distribution center we plan to open in the second half of fiscal we also expect to continue to generate sufficient cash to enable us to expand and remodel our store base  to provide capital expenditures for both distribution center and technology upgrade projects and to repurchase shares of our common stock through the stock repurchase plan 
hibbett maintains a merchandise management system that allows us to identify and monitor trends 
however  this system does not produce us generally accepted accounting principle gaap financial information by product category 
thus it is impracticable to provide gaap net sales by product category 
hibbett operates on a or week fiscal year ending on the saturday nearest to january of each year 
the consolidated statement of operations for fiscal year ended february  includes weeks of operations while the consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years ended january  and january  both include weeks of operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to net sales of certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations expressed for the periods indicated 
percentages may not add due to rounding fiscal year ended february  january  january  net sales cost of goods sold  including distribution and store occupancy costs gross profit store operating  selling and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization operating income interest income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended february   from million for the weeks ended january  we attribute this increase to the following factors we opened hibbett sports and closed hibbett sports stores and sports additions stores for net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended february  new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended january  primarily as the result of an increase in price 
higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
we believe sales pick up related to the rd week contributed approximately to the increase in sales over last year 
we believe the increase in comparable store sales is attributable to an overall positive merchandise performance during the year and increased focus on customer service 
additionally  our results were positively impacted in the third quarter by the introduction of tax free holidays in three of our states and an increased promotional effort in an attempt to leverage the strong post hurricane sales from the prior year 
we also experienced strong seasonal sales in the last quarter of fiscal related to the christmas holidays 
nike and under armour brands experienced solid performance in youth and cleats  performance apparel and team equipment 
pro and college licensed apparel performed well  particularly in youth products and nfl jerseys 
key professional teams in our market included the indianapolis colts  new orleans saints and chicago bears 
top selling nfl jerseys included peyton manning  reggie bush  tony romo and brian urlacher 
college licensed apparel was led by women s nike product 
we continue to experience weakness in caps and in classics footwear 
comparable store net sales data for the period reflects sales for our traditional format hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
if a store remodel or relocation results in the store being closed for a significant period of time  its sales are removed from the comparable store base until it has been open a full months 
during the weeks ended january   stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison 
our four sports co 
stores are not and have never been included in the comparable store net sales comparison because we have not opened a superstore since september nor do we plan to open additional superstores in the future 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended february   compared with million  or of net sales  in the week period of the prior fiscal year 
we attribute this increase in gross profit primarily to a reduction in markdown rate 
occupancy  as a percent of net sales  improved by basis points year over year due to decreases in common area maintenance and rental expenses as a percentage of sales 
offsetting these decreases were distribution center costs by basis points  primarily due to the increased repair and maintenance expenses and a decrease in vendor violations 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended february   compared with million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january  these expenses increased as a percentage of net sales between periods primarily due to the implementation of r which added basis points in stock based compensation 
other trends experienced included an increase in legal fees as a percent of net sales of basis points related to pending litigation  an increase in credit debit card fees as a percent of net sales of basis points related to the increased use of these tenders by our customers over cash  and decreases as a percent of net sales in insurance costs of basis points and freight and shipping costs of basis points 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended february   and in the weeks ended january  we experienced a slight trend upwards in the terms of our new store leases which contributed to the leveraging of depreciation expense as leasehold improvements were expensed over the longer lease term which  in most cases  is less than the estimated useful life of the asset 
our average lease term of leases added in fiscal was years compared to years for leases added in fiscal provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended february   compared to for the weeks ended january  the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal the increase in rate over last year is primarily the result of the permanent difference related to incentive stock options arising as a result of applying the provisions of sfas no 
r 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended january   from million for the weeks ended january  we attribute this increase to the following factors we opened hibbett sports stores and sports additions store and closed hibbett sports stores for net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended january  new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended january  approximately of this increase was the result of an increase in transactions with the remainder due to an increase in price 
higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
we believe sales pick up related to the quarter hurricanes contributed to of the increase in comparable sales 
the increase in comparable store sales was driven by an increase in sales in all three of our product categories  apparel  footwear and equipment 
apparel was positive in comp stores due to strong performance in urban and activewear which offset a weakness in the pro licensed category 
footwear was positive in all major categories  led by nike  fila  asics  mizuno and k swiss 
children s categories  performance and cleats were particularly strong performers 
equipment sales were positively impacted in all major hardgood categories  particularly baseball  football  soccer and basketball 
comparable store net sales data for the period reflects sales for our traditional format hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
if a store remodel or relocation results in the store being closed for a significant period of time  its sales are removed from the comparable store base until it has been open a full months 
during the weeks ended january   stores were included in the comparable store sales comparison 
our four sports co 
stores are not and have never been included in the comparable store net sales comparison because we have not opened a superstore since september nor do we plan to open additional superstores in the future 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  in the same period of the prior fiscal year 
this year s gross margin is primarily attributable to the increased product margin in apparel and footwear  the leveraging of occupancy and distribution center cost and improved inventory turn 
product margin rate increased due to additional vendor discounts and lower markdowns 
occupancy  as a percent of net sales  improved by basis points year over year due to decreases in common area maintenance and rental expenses as a percentage of sales 
distribution center costs improved by basis points  primarily due to the leveraging of salaries and benefits 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  for the comparable period a year ago 
these expenses remained consistent as a percentage of net sales between periods  but experienced the following trends labor and benefits expenses accounted for a decrease as a percent of net sales of basis points at the store level as compared to the same period last year 
this was somewhat offset by an increase of basis points in administrative salaries and benefits as compared to the same period last year as we grew our corporate infrastructure to position ourselves for continued store growth 
professional fees  primarily associated with sarbanes oxley compliance and testing  decreased basis points as compared to the same period last year 
legal fees related to pending litigation and debit card expenses related to increased usage over cash tender both increased basis points as compared to the same period last year 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   and in the weeks ended january  the leveraging in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of net sales is due to an increase in sales this year compared to the same weeks last year as well as an increase in asset lives related to lease terms 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   compared to for the weeks ended january   due to an increase in pre tax income 
the increase was somewhat offset by a decrease in the effective tax rate for fiscal as a result of the resolution of state income tax issues 
the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to new store openings  stock repurchases and working capital requirements 
our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through our cash flow from operations and occasionally from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year ended february  january  january  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business 
typically  we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons  such as pre christmas and back to school 
inventory levels are reduced in connection with higher sales during the peak selling seasons and this inventory reduction  combined with proportionately higher net income  typically produces a positive cash flow 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the weeks ended february  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million and million in the weeks ended january  and january   respectively 
inventory levels and inventory turns have continued to increase year over year as store levels have increased 
the increase in inventory used cash of million  million and million during fiscal years ended  and  respectively  while the accounts payable decrease used cash of million and million during fiscal years ended and  respectively 
accounts payable offset the use of cash by million in fiscal also offsetting these uses of cash were net income of million  million and million during fiscal years ended  and  respectively  and non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization expense of million  million and million during fiscal years ended  and  respectively  and stock based compensation expense during fiscal of million 
investing activities 
cash provided by investing activities in the fiscal periods ended february   january  and january  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
during fiscal period  net redemption of short term investments was million compared to net purchases of short term investments of million during fiscal period we did not have any short term investment activity in fiscal gross capital expenditures used million  million and million during fiscal periods ended  and  respectively 
we use cash in investing activities to build new stores and remodel or relocate existing stores 
furthermore  net cash used in investing activities includes purchases of information technology assets and expenditures for our distribution facility and corporate headquarters 
we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended february  we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended january  we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended january we estimate the cash outlay for capital expenditures in fiscal year ended february  will be approximately million  which relates to the opening of approximately new stores  remodeling of selected existing stores  information system upgrades and various improvements at our headquarters and distribution center 
of the total budgeted dollars for capital expenditures for fiscal  we anticipate that approximately will be related to the opening of new stores and remodeling and or relocating existing stores 
approximately will be related to the opening of the new distribution facility and miscellaneous distribution center upgrades 
approximately will be related to information systems with the remaining related primarily to automobiles and security equipment for our stores 
as of february   we had an approximate million outlay remaining on our jda merchandising system implementation 
we implemented this new merchandising system on february  and believe this system will help us develop better efficiencies in the allocation and planning of inventory and better enable us to analyze and generally improve sales across all markets and merchandise by allowing us to better analyze inventory at the store level 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in the weeks ended february  compared to million and million in the weeks ended january  and january   respectively 
the cash fluctuation as compared to prior fiscal years was primarily the result of the repurchase of our common stock 
in fiscal we expended million on repurchases of our common stock compared to million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
financing activities also consisted of proceeds from transactions in our common stock and the excess tax benefit from the exercise of incentive stock options 
as stock options are exercised  we will continue to receive proceeds and expect a tax deduction  however  the amounts and timing cannot be predicted 
at february   we had a revolving credit facility that allows borrowings up to million and which renews annually in november 
under the provisions of this facility  we can draw down funds when our main operating account falls below  the facility does not require a commitment or agency fee and there are no covenant restrictions associated with the facility 
we plan to renew this facility as it expires and do not anticipate any problems in doing so  however  no assurance can be given that we will be granted a renewal or terms which are acceptable to us 
at january   we had two unsecured credit facilities that allowed borrowings up to million and million and which renewed annually in november 
under the provisions of these facilities  we could draw down funds when our main operating account fell below  neither facility required a commitment or agency fee nor were there any covenant requirements 
at january   we had an unsecured revolving credit facility that allowed borrowings up to million and which expired november  the credit facility was subject to renewal every two years 
under the provisions of this facility  we paid a commitment fee of  annually and could draw down funds when the balance of our main operating account fell below  as of february   january  and january   we had no debt outstanding under any of these facilities 
based on our current operating and store opening plans and plans for the repurchase of our common stock  we believe we can fund our cash needs for the foreseeable future through cash generated from operations and  if necessary  through periodic future borrowings against our credit facility 
the following table lists the aggregate maturities of various classes of obligations and expiration amounts of various classes of commitments related to hibbett sports  inc at february  payments due under contractual obligations in thousands long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter see debt consolidated financial statements 
note in item as of fiscal year ended  we do not have any capital lease obligations 
see lease commitments consolidated financial statements 
note in item off balance sheet arrangements we have not provided any financial guarantees as of february  all purchase obligations are cancelable and therefore are not included in the table above 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating our business 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into the financial statements 
inflation and other economic factors our ability to provide quality merchandise on a profitable basis may be subject to economic factors and influences that we cannot control 
national or international events  including the war on terrorism  could lead to disruptions in economies in the united states or in foreign countries where a significant portion of our merchandise is manufactured 
these and other factors could increase our merchandise costs and other costs that are critical to our operations 
consumer spending could also decline because of economic pressures 
merchandise costs 
based on current economic conditions  we expect that any increase in merchandise costs per unit will be offset by improved vendor discounts and increased retail prices in fiscal freight costs 
we continued to experience rising fuel costs during fiscal that increased our freight costs 
however  these fuel cost increases began to stabilize somewhat towards the end of fiscal and we expect this stabilization to continue 
we do not expect increases in freight costs to have a material effect on our results of operations as we continue to leverage the costs associated with inbound freight against the cost of outbound freight 
minimum wage 
an increase in the mandated minimum wage could significantly increase our payroll costs 
there is currently legislation in congress that would raise the federal minimum wage by approximately by march with the first increase of an estimated to take place in fiscal also  eight of the states we operate in passed legislation to raise the minimum wage beginning in calendar year  some with automatic provision for future increase based on the consumer price index 
insurance costs 
in fiscal  we experienced an increase in general business insurance costs due to raised limits on directors and officers insurance and expanded coverage on our distribution center 
during the same period  health insurance declined due to a reduction in claims 
in fiscal  we experienced a decrease in general business insurance costs primarily because we changed to a partially self insured program for our workers compensation and general liability 
during the same period  we experienced an increase in our average monthly health insurance claims 
in fiscal  we expect that general business insurance costs will stabilize while health insurance costs will increase slightly

revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue  including gift card and layaway sales  in accordance with the sec sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
retail merchandise sales occur on site in our retail stores 
customers have the option of paying the full purchase price of the merchandise upon sale or paying a down payment and placing the merchandise on layaway 
the customer may make further payments in installments  but the entire purchase price for merchandise placed on layaway must be received by us within days 
the down payment and any installments are recorded by us as short term deferred revenue until the customer pays the entire purchase price for the merchandise 
we recognize revenue at the time the customer takes possession of the merchandise 
retail sales are recorded net of returns and discounts and exclude sales taxes 
the cost of coupon sales incentives is recognized at the time the related revenue is recognized by us 
proceeds received from the issuance of gift cards are initially recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue is subsequently recognized at the time the customer redeems the gift cards and takes possession of the merchandise 
unredeemed gift cards are recorded as a current liability 
it is not our policy to take unclaimed layaway deposits and unredeemed gift cards into income 
as of february   january  and january   there was no breakage revenue recorded in income 
the deferred revenue liability for layaway deposits and unredeemed gift cards was million  million and million at february   january  and january   respectively 
any unrecognized breakage revenue is immaterial 
inventory valuation 
cost is assigned to store inventories using the retail inventory method 
in using this method  the valuation of inventories at cost and the resulting gross margins are computed by applying a calculated cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
the retail method is an averaging method that has been widely used in the retail industry and results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market when markdowns are taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories on a timely basis 
inventory valuation methods require certain significant management estimates and judgments 
these include estimates of merchandise markdowns and shrinkage  which significantly affect the ending inventory valuation at cost  as well as the resulting gross margins 
the averaging required in applying the retail inventory valuation method and the estimates of shrink and markdowns may  under certain circumstances  result in inaccurate cost figures 
inaccurate inventory cost may be caused by applying the retail inventory method to a group of products that have differing characteristics related to gross margin and turnover 
we accrue for inventory shrinkage based on the actual historical shrink results of our most recent physical inventories 
these estimates are compared to actual results as physical inventory counts are performed and reconciled to the general ledger 
store counts are performed on a cyclical basis and the distribution center s counts are performed mid year and at the end of december or in early january every year 
our management believes that the application of the retail inventory method results in an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
beginning in fiscal  we will value our inventory at the lower of cost or market on a weighted average cost basis  using the cost method 
we believe the cost method is preferable as compared to the retail method because it will increase the organizational focus on the actual margin realized on each sale 
this change in accounting method is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accrued expenses 
on a monthly basis  we estimate certain material expenses in an effort to record those expenses in the period incurred 
our most material estimates relate to payroll and payroll tax expenses  property taxes  insurance related expenses and utility expenses 
estimates are primarily based on current activity and historical results and are adjusted as our estimates change 
differences in our estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the accrual calculated 
historically  the differences in these accruals have not had a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
income taxes 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate our required tax liability and assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets 
our taxes payable are estimated based on enacted tax rates  including estimated tax rates in states where our store base is growing applied to the income expected to be taxed currently 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax projections for future taxable income 
we cannot guarantee that we will generate income in future years 
litigation accruals 
estimated amounts for claims that are probable and can be reasonably estimated are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the likelihood of a material change in these estimated accruals would be dependent on new claims as they may arise and the favorable or unfavorable outcome of a particular litigation 
as additional information becomes available  we assess the potential liability related to pending litigation and revise estimates as appropriate 
such revisions in estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations and financial position 
impairment of assets 
the company continually evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining balance of long lived assets and intangibles may be impaired and not recoverable 
the company s policy is to recognize any impairment loss on long lived assets as a charge to current income when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is assessed considering the estimated undiscounted cash flows over the asset s remaining life 
if estimated cash flows are insufficient to recover the investment  an impairment loss is recognized based on a comparison of the cost of the asset to fair value less any costs of disposition 
stock based compensation 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value at the date of grant of stock options granted under our stock option plans and stock purchase rights associated with the employee stock purchase plan 
volatility is estimated as of the date of grant or purchase date based on management s estimate of the time period that captures the relative volatility of our stock 
we use the risk free interest rate on the date of grant or purchase date based on the us treasury rate with maturities approximating the expected lives of our options 
the effects on net income and eps of stock based compensation expense  net of tax  calculated using the fair value of stock options and stock purchase rights in accordance with the black scholes options pricing model are not necessarily representative of the effects of our results of operations in the future 
in addition  the compensation expense utilizes an option pricing model developed for traded options with relatively short lives 
our stock option grants have a life of up to ten years and are not transferable 
therefore  the actual fair value of a stock option grant may be different from the company s estimates 
the company believes that its estimates incorporate all relevant information and represent a reasonable approximation in light of the difficulties involved in valuing non traded stock options 
all estimates and assumptions are regularly evaluated and updated when applicable 
insurance accruals 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including employee related health benefits  a portion of which is paid by our employees  workers compensation and general liability 
the estimates and accruals for these liabilities associated with these risks are regularly evaluated for adequacy based on the most current available information  including historical claims experience and expected future claims costs 
operating leases 
we lease our retail stores and distribution center under operating leases 
many lease agreements contain rent holidays  rent escalation clauses and or contingent rent provisions 
we recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  including cancelable option periods where failure to exercise such options would result in an economic penalty 
we use a time period for our straight line rent expense calculation that equals or exceeds the time period used for depreciation 
in addition  the commencement date of the lease term is the earlier of the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments or the date when we take possession of the building for initial setup of fixtures and merchandise 
dividend policy we have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock 
we currently intend to retain our future earnings to finance the growth and development of our business and for our stock repurchase program  and therefore do not anticipate declaring or paying cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future 
any future decision to declare or pay dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
controls and procedures we maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our exchange act reports is recorded  processed  summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec  and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer see item a 
quarterly and seasonal fluctuations we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal fluctuations in our net sales and operating income 
our net sales and operating income are typically higher in the fourth quarter due to sales increases during the holiday selling season 
however  the seasonal fluctuations are mitigated by the strong product demand in the spring and back to school sales periods 
our quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new store openings  the amount and timing of net sales contributed by new stores  the level of pre opening expenses associated with new stores  the relative proportion of new stores to mature stores  merchandise mix  the relative proportion of stores represented by each of our three store concepts and demand for apparel and accessories driven by local interest in sporting events 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows are subject to market risk from interest rate fluctuations on our working capital facilities  which bear interest at rates that vary with libor  prime or quoted cost of funds rates 
during the majority of fiscal and all of fiscal  we had two operating facilities allowing borrowings up to million 
effective november  we elected to renew only one facility that allows borrowings up to million and renews annually 
at the end of fiscal and fiscal  we had no borrowings outstanding under any working capital facility 
there were twenty four days during the fifty three weeks ended february   where we incurred borrowings against our credit facilities for an average and maximum borrowing of approximately million and million and an average interest rate of 
at no time during the fifty two weeks ended january   did we incur borrowings against our credit facility 
there were three days during the fifty two weeks ended january   where we incurred borrowings against our credit facility for an average borrowing of  during fiscal  the maximum amount outstanding against these agreements was approximately  and the weighted average interest rate was 
a increase or decrease in market interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
