the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our selected consolidated financial data and consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
overview ciena corporation is a supplier of communications networking equipment  software and services that support the transport  switching  aggregation and management of voice  video and data traffic 
our products are used  individually or as part of an integrated solution  in communications network infrastructures operated by telecommunications service providers  cable operators  governments and enterprises around the globe 
our products facilitate the cost effective delivery of enterprise and consumer oriented communication services 
through our flexselect architecture  we specialize in transitioning legacy communications networks to converged  next generation architectures  better able to handle increased traffic and to deliver more efficiently a broader mix of high bandwidth communications services 
by improving network productivity  reducing costs and enabling integrated service offerings  our converged ethernet infrastructure and broadband access products create business and operational value for our customers 
over the past fiscal year  market conditions and the execution of our network specialist strategy enabled us to generate revenue of million  representing a increase from fiscal revenue of million 
growth in consumer and enterprise reliance upon communications services continues to drive increases in network capacity requirements and new high bandwidth applications and services 
the resulting broader mix of high volume traffic is driving a transition from legacy network infrastructures to more efficient  simplified  ethernet based network architectures 
we believe that our flexselect architecture and ethernet ip related enhancements to our product portfolio have enabled us to benefit from both increasing capacity requirements and the convergence of networks to more efficient and economical architectures 
we believe that these conditions that have allowed us to achieve significant revenue growth over the past two fiscal years will enable continued growth of our business during fiscal  although we currently expect a somewhat lower annual growth rate than we achieved in fiscal consolidation within the telecommunications industry and among several of our largest customers continues to affect our concentration of revenue 
for fiscal  two customers each accounted for greater than of our fiscal revenue  and in the aggregate 
at t represented and sprint represented 
we believe that our fiscal results illustrate our success in leveraging our incumbent position within large carriers 
however  this concentration of our revenue exposes us to additional risks  including greater pricing pressure and increased susceptibility to changes in customers network strategy or reductions in their capital expenditures 
our percentage of international revenue increased from million  or of total revenue  in fiscal to million  or of total revenue in fiscal we expect our international sales to continue to increase as a percentage of revenue in fiscal revenue was million for the fourth quarter of fiscal  representing a sequential quarterly increase 
while we believe that we will be able to grow annual revenue from the level achieved for fiscal  the nature of our business continues to expose us to the likelihood of quarterly fluctuation in revenue during fiscal a sizable portion of our revenue comes from sales to a small number of telecommunications service providers for large communication network builds 
these projects are generally characterized by large and sporadic equipment orders and contract terms that can result in the recognition or deferral of significant amounts of revenue in a given quarter 
the level of demand for our products  the timing and size of equipment orders  our ability to deliver products to fulfill those orders  and the timing of product acceptance for revenue recognition all contribute to and can cause fluctuations in our revenue on a quarterly basis 
improving and stabilizing gross margin was an area of significant focus for us during fiscal gross margin for fiscal was  up from in fiscal  and product gross margin was  up from 
gross margin for the fourth quarter of fiscal was 
gross margin improvement during fiscal reflects the effect of favorable product and customer mix and the negative effect of a reduced services gross margin 
our increased gross margin for fiscal also reflects significant product cost reductions and improved manufacturing efficiencies  as we increasingly utilize lower cost suppliers in asia 
part of our strategy is to maintain the product gross margin improvements made during fiscal by focusing on the development and sale of ethernet based  software intensive products that enable the flexible  cost effective delivery of higher value communications services 
our gross margin  however  continues to be susceptible to quarterly fluctuation due to a number of factors  including product and customer mix during the period  our ability to drive further product cost reductions  the level of pricing pressure we encounter  the effect of changes in our services gross margin  the introduction of new products or entry into new markets  charges for excess and obsolete inventory and changes in warranty costs 
operating expense increased from million in fiscal to in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of revenue from to 
operating expense for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  a slight increase from million in the third quarter of fiscal we expect operating expense to increase in absolute dollars during fiscal to support growth of the business  research and development projects  and increased headcount for our india development site and sales resources 
the results above drove significant improvements in income from operations and net income during fiscal income from operations increased from a loss of million in fiscal to income of million in fiscal net income increased from million  or per diluted share  in fiscal to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  or per diluted share 
this compares with net income of million  or per diluted share  for the third quarter of fiscal we continue to work to gain additional leverage from our operating model to drive operating margin improvements 
we expect interest income  which was a significant component of our net income in fiscal  to decrease as a result of our repayment of the remaining principal balance of million on our convertible notes during the first quarter of fiscal  and lower interest rates on investment balances 
we generated million in cash from operations during fiscal as compared to our use of million during fiscal cash from operations during fiscal consisted of million in cash from net income adjusted for non cash charges and a million net decrease in cash resulting from changes in working capital 
we generated million in cash from operations during the fourth quarter of fiscal  consisting of million in cash from net income adjusted for non cash charges and a million net use of cash resulting from changes in working capital 
this compares with million in cash from generated from operations during the third quarter of fiscal  consisting of million in cash from net income adjusted for non cash charges and a million net increase in cash resulting from changes in working capital 
on june   we completed a million public offering of convertible senior notes due june  this offering resulted in net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts  expenses and million we used to purchase a call spread option on our common stock 
the call spread option is intended to mitigate our exposure to potential dilution from the conversion of the notes 
we expect to use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes  which may include the repurchase  or repayment at maturity  of our outstanding convertible notes 
the remaining principal balance on our outstanding convertible notes of million becomes due and payable on february  see liquidity and capital resources and notes and to our financial statements in item of part ii of this report for a discussion of our convertible notes and call spread options 
we had million in cash and cash equivalents and million short term and long term investments in marketable debt securities at october  our investments in marketable debt securities at october  reflect a million realized loss recognized during the fourth quarter of related to our investments in commercial paper issued by two structured investment vehicles that entered receivership during the fourth quarter of fiscal and failed to make payment at maturity 
due to the mortgage related assets that they hold  each of these entities has been exposed to adverse market conditions that have affected the value of their collateral and their ability to access short term funding 
at the time of our investment in the third quarter of fiscal  each investment had a rating of a by standard and poor s and p by moody s  their highest ratings respectively 
giving effect to these losses  our investment portfolio at october  included an estimated fair value of million in commercial paper issued by these two sivs 
information and the markets relating to these investments remain dynamic and there may be further declines in the value of these investments  the value of the collateral held by these entities  and the liquidity of our investments 
to the extent we determine that a further decline in fair value is other than temporary  we may recognize additional realized losses in future periods  up to the aggregate amount of these investments  which would have a negative effect on our net income 
see critical accounting policies and estimates investments below for additional information regarding this loss and our determination of the fair value of these investments at october  as of october   headcount was  an increase from  at october  and an increase from  at july  results of operations in this report we discuss our revenue in three major groupings as follows converged ethernet infrastructure 
this group incorporates our transport and switching products and packet interworking products and related software previously reported in our optical networking and data networking product groups 
ethernet access 
this group includes our cnx broadband dsl system and cnx plus modular broadband loop carrier and related software previously reported in our broadband access product group 
for the periods covered in this report  this group does not include cn ethernet access series  as we have yet to recognize revenue related to this recently announced product 
global network services 
this group continues to include revenue associated with our service  support and training activities 
cost of goods sold consists of component costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees  direct technical support costs  cost of excess and obsolete inventory and overhead related to manufacturing  technical support  and engineering  furnishing and installation ef i operations

we believe that our converged ethernet infrastructure revenue has benefitted from both increasing network capacity requirements and the transition to more efficient and economical network architectures 
increased product revenue for fiscal primarily reflects a million increase in sales of core switching products  a million increase in core transport and a million increase of our cn flexselect advanced service platform 
the decrease in ethernet access product revenue reflects a million reduction in sales of our cnx broadband dsl system  which was negatively affected by customer consolidation activity 
service revenue increased primarily due to increases of million in deployment service sales and million in maintenance and support services  reflecting increased sales volume and increased installation activity 
united states revenue increased due to a million increase in sales of our converged ethernet infrastructure products

this primarily reflects a million increase in sales of our cn flexselect advanced service platform and a million increase in sales of core transport products 
international revenue also reflects an increase of million in service revenue  primarily related to deployment 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to product gross margin improvement offset by a significant reduction in services gross margin 
gross profit on products as a percentage of product revenue increased primarily due to favorable product and customer mix  significant product cost reductions  improved manufacturing efficiencies  and lower warranty expense 
gross profit on services as a percentage of services revenue decreased significantly as a result of increased deployment overhead costs associated with the expansion of our internal resources related to deployment activities for international network infrastructure projects

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expense  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
on an ongoing basis  we reevaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  income taxes  warranty obligations  restructuring  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
among other things  these estimates form the basis for judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
to the extent that there are material differences between our estimates and actual results  our consolidated financial statements will be affected 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies reflect those areas where significant judgments and estimates are used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab which states that revenue is realized or realizable and earned when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
customer purchase agreements and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
in instances where final acceptance of the product  system  or solution is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
revenue for maintenance services is generally deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
some of our communications networking equipment is integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of the equipment 
accordingly  we account for revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  sop and all related interpretations 
sop incorporates additional guidance unique to software arrangements incorporated with general revenue recognition criteria  such as  revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
in instances where final acceptance of the product is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
arrangements with customers may include multiple deliverables  including any combination of equipment  services and software 
if multiple element arrangements include software or software related elements  we apply the provisions of sop to determine the amount of the arrangement fee to be allocated to those separate units of accounting 
multiple element arrangements that include software are separated into more than one unit of accounting if the functionality of the delivered element s is not dependent on the undelivered element s  there is vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value of the undelivered element s  and general revenue recognition criteria related to the delivered element s have been met 
the amount of product and service revenue recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether an arrangement includes multiple elements and  if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and our ability to establish vendor specific objective evidence for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
for all other deliverables  we apply the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf 
eitf allows for separation of elements into more than one unit of accounting if the delivered element s have value to the customer on a stand alone basis  objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered element s  and delivery of the undelivered element s is probable and substantially within our control 
revenue is allocated to each unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each accounting unit or using the residual method if objective evidence of fair value does not exist for the delivered element s 
the revenue recognition criteria described above is applied to each separate unit of accounting 
if these criteria are not met  revenue is deferred until the criteria are met or the last element has been delivered 
our total deferred revenue for products was million and million as of october  and  respectively 
our service revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the period during which the services are to be performed 
our total deferred revenue for services was million and million as of october  and  respectively 
share based compensation on november   we adopted sfas r  share based payments  as interpreted by sab  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for share based awards based on estimated fair values 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant 
share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations includes compensation expense for share based awards granted i prior to  but not yet vested as of october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas  and ii subsequent to october   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r  as interpreted by sab we estimate the fair value of each option based award on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
this option pricing model requires that we make several estimates  including the option s expected life and the price volatility of the underlying stock 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the weighted average period the stock options are expected to remain outstanding 
because we consider our options to be plain vanilla  we calculate the expected life using the simplified method as prescribed in sab under sab  options are considered to be plain vanilla if they have the following basic characteristics granted at the money  exerciseability is conditioned upon service through the vesting date  termination of service prior to vesting results in forfeiture  limited exercise period following termination of service  and options are non transferable and non hedgeable 
we consider the implied volatility and historical volatility of our stock price in determining our expected volatility  and  finding both to be equally reliable  have determined that a combination of both measures would result in the best estimate of expected volatility 
the estimated fair value of option based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  is recognized as stock based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
we estimate the fair value of our restricted stock unit awards based on the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
our outstanding restricted stock unit awards are subject to service based vesting conditions and or performance based vesting conditions 
the estimated fair value of service based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  is recognized as share based expense ratably over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
awards with performance based vesting conditions require the achievement of certain company based  financial or other performance criteria or targets as a condition to the vesting  or acceleration of vesting  of such awards 
the estimated fair value of performance based awards  net of estimated forfeitures  is recognized as share based expense over the performance period  using graded vesting  which considers each performance period or tranche separately  and based upon our determination of whether it is probable that the performance targets will be achieved 
at each reporting period  we reassess the probability of achieving the performance targets and the performance period required to meet those targets 
determining whether the performance targets will be achieved involves judgment  and the estimate of expense may be revised periodically based on the probability of achieving the performance targets 
revisions are reflected in the period in which the estimate is changed 
if any performance goals are not met  no compensation cost is ultimately recognized and  to the extent previously recognized  compensation cost is reversed 
no tax benefits were attributed to the share based compensation expense because a full valuation allowance was maintained for all net deferred tax assets 
because share based compensation expense is based on awards that are ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense takes into account estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
see note to our financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information regarding our treatment of share based compensation 
reserve for inventory obsolescence we make estimates about future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate reserve for excess and obsolete inventory 
we write down inventory that has become obsolete or unmarketable by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
inventory write downs are a component of our product cost of goods sold 
upon recognition of the write down  a new lower cost basis for that inventory is established  and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly established cost basis 
we recorded charges for excess and obsolete inventory of million  million  and million in fiscal  and respectively 
these charges were primarily related to excess inventory due to a change in forecasted sales for certain of our products 
in an effort to limit our exposure to delivery delays and to satisfy customer needs we purchase inventory based on forecasted sales across our product lines 
in addition  part of our research and development strategy is to promote the convergence of similar features and functionalities across our product lines 
each of these practices exposes us to an increased risk that our customers will not order those products for which we have forecasted sales  or will purchase less than we have forecasted 
historically  we have experienced write downs due to changes in strategic direction  discontinuance of a product and declines in market conditions 
if actual market conditions differ from those we have assumed  if there is a sudden and significant decrease in demand for our products  or if there is a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence due to a rapid change in technology  we may be required to take additional inventory write downs and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
restructuring as part of our restructuring costs  we provide for the estimated cost of the net lease expense for facilities that are no longer being used 
the provision is equal to the fair value of the minimum future lease payments under our contracted lease obligations  offset by the fair value of the estimated sublease payments that we may receive 
as of october   our accrued restructuring liability related to net lease expense and other related charges was million 
the total minimum lease payments for these restructured facilities are million 
these lease payments will be made over the remaining lives of our leases  which range from three months to eleven years 
if actual market conditions are different than those we have projected  we are required to recognize additional restructuring costs or benefits associated with these facilities 
during fiscal  we recognized net adjustments resulting in restructuring costs of million  which included a million adjustment during the third quarter of fiscal relating to our unused san jose  ca facilities 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we paid million in connection with the settlement of our lease obligation related to previously restructured facilities in san jose  ca 
this transaction resulted in a gain on lease settlement of million by eliminating our remaining unfavorable lease commitment balance of million and reducing our restructuring liabilities by million  offset by approximately million of other expenses 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is based on management s assessment  on a specific identification basis  of the collectibility of customer accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally have not required collateral or other forms of security from customers 
in determining the appropriate balance for our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  management considers each individual customer account receivable in order to determine collectability 
in doing so  management considers creditworthiness  payment history  account activity and communication with such customer 
if a customer s financial condition changes  or if actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  we may be required to take a charge for an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
goodwill as of october   our consolidated balance sheet included million in goodwill 
this amount primarily represents the remaining excess of the total purchase price of our acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
in accordance with sfas  we test our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  which we have determined to be the last business day of fiscal september each year  and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would  more likely than not  reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
there was no impairment of goodwill in fiscal or during the fourth quarter of  we incurred a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million 
if actual industry or market conditions change or our forecasts change at the time of our annual assessment or in periods prior to our annual assessment  we may be required to record additional goodwill impairment charges 
such charges would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period 
intangible assets as of october   our consolidated balance sheet included million in other intangible assets  net 
we account for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets such as equipment  furniture  fixtures  and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas in accordance with sfas  we test each intangible asset for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
valuation of our intangible assets requires us to make assumptions about future sales prices and sales volumes for our products that involve new technologies and uncertainties around customer acceptance of new products 
if actual market conditions differ or our forecasts change  we may be required to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
such charges would have the effect of decreasing our earnings or increasing our losses in such period 
investments we have an investment portfolio comprised of marketable debt securities including short term commercial paper  certificates of deposit  corporate bonds  asset backed obligations and us government obligations 
the value of these securities is subject to market volatility for the period we hold these investments and until their sale or maturity 
we recognize realized losses when declines in the fair value of our investments  below their cost basis  are judged to be other than temporary 
in determining whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary  we consider various factors including market price when available  investment ratings  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than our cost basis  and our intent and ability to hold the investment until maturity or for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
we make significant judgments in considering these factors 
if it is judged that a decline in fair value is other than temporary  the investment is valued at the current fair value and a realized loss equal to the decline is reflected in net income  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that declines in the estimated fair value of our investments in certain commercial paper were other than temporary 
this commercial paper was issued by siv portfolio plc formerly known as cheyne finance plc and rhinebridge llc  two structured investment vehicles sivs that entered into receivership during the fourth quarter of fiscal and failed to make payment at maturity 
due to the mortgage related assets that they hold  each of these entities has been exposed to adverse market conditions that have affected the value of their collateral and their ability to access short term funding 
we purchased these investments in the third quarter of fiscal and  at the time of purchase  each investment had a rating of a by standard and poor s and p by moody s  their highest ratings respectively 
these investments are no longer trading and have no readily determinable market value 
we have reviewed current investment ratings  valuation estimates of the underlying collateral  company specific news and events  and general economic conditions in considering the fair value of these investments 
in estimating fair value  we used a valuation approach based on a liquidation of assets held by each siv and their subsequent distribution of cash 
we utilized assessments of the underlying collateral from multiple indicators of value  which were then discounted to reflect the expected timing of disposition and market risks 
based on this assessment of fair value  as of october   we recognized realized losses of million related to these investments 
giving effect to these losses  our investment portfolio at october  included an estimated fair value of million in commercial paper issued by these entities 
see note to the financial statements included as item of part ii of this report 
information and the markets relating to these investments remain dynamic and there may be further declines in the value of these investments  the value of the collateral held by these entities  and the liquidity of our investments 
to the extent we determine that a further decline in fair value is other than temporary  we may recognize additional realized losses in future periods up to the aggregate amount of these investments 
we are not aware of any other of our marketable debt securities that have experienced a similar decline in fair value 
our investments are subject to general credit  liquidity  market and interest rate risks  which may be exacerbated by us sub prime mortgage defaults that have affected various sectors of the financial markets and caused credit and liquidity issues 
as of october  our marketable debt investments had unrealized losses of million 
these gross unrealized losses were primarily due to changes in interest rates 
management has determined that the gross unrealized losses on our marketable debt investments at october   are temporary in nature because we have the ability and intent to hold these investments until a recovery of fair value  which may be maturity 
as of october   our minority investments in privately held technology companies  reported in other assets  were million 
these investments are generally carried at cost because we own less than of the voting equity and do not have the ability to exercise significant influence over any of these companies 
these investments are inherently high risk 
the markets for technologies or products manufactured by these companies are usually early stage at the time of our investment and such markets may never materialize or become significant 
we could lose our entire investment in some or all of these companies 
we monitor these investments for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying values when necessary 
if market conditions  the expected financial performance  or the competitive position of the companies in which we invest deteriorate  we may be required to record a charge in future periods due to impairment in their value 
deferred tax valuation allowance as of october   we have recorded a valuation allowance fully offsetting gross deferred tax assets of billion 
we calculated the valuation allowance in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for income taxes  which requires an assessment of both positive and negative evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets  when measuring the need for a valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in determining net deferred tax assets and valuation allowances  management is required to make judgments and estimates related to projections of profitability  the timing and extent of the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards  applicable tax rates  transfer pricing methodologies and tax planning strategies 
the valuation allowance is reviewed quarterly and is maintained until sufficient positive evidence exists to support the reversal 
because evidence such as our operating results during the most recent three year period is afforded more weight than forecasted results for future periods  our cumulative loss during this three year period represents sufficient negative evidence regarding the need for a full valuation allowance under sfas we will release this valuation allowance when management determines that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if we are able to sustain a meaningful level of profitability in future periods  and forecast sufficient earnings for periods thereafter  we may be required to release a significant portion of the valuation allowance 
any future release of valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit increasing net income  an adjustment to acquisition intangibles  or an adjustment to paid in capital 
because we expect our recorded tax rate to increase in subsequent periods following a release of the valuation allowance  our net income would be affected in periods following the release 
any valuation allowance release will not affect the amount of cash paid for income taxes warranty our liability for product warranties  included in other accrued liabilities  was million as of october  our products are generally covered by a warranty for periods ranging from one to five years 
we accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of goods sold based on associated material costs  technical support labor costs  and associated overhead 
material cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment 
technical support labor cost is estimated based primarily upon historical trends and the cost to support the customer cases within the warranty period 
the provision for product warranties was million  million  and million in fiscal  and respectively 
the provision for warranty claims may fluctuate on a quarterly basis depending upon the mix of products and customers in that period 
if actual product failure rates  material replacement costs  service or labor costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty provision would be required 
an increase in warranty claims or the related costs associated with satisfying these warranty obligations could increase our cost of sales and negatively affect our gross margin 
loss contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various losses arising in the ordinary course of business 
these may relate to disputes  litigation and other legal actions 
we consider the likelihood of loss or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
a loss is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether any accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements see note to our financial statements included in item of part ii of this report for information relating to our discussion of the effects of recent accounting pronouncements 
unaudited quarterly results of operations the tables below in thousands  except per share data set forth the operating results represented by certain items in our statements of operations for each of the eight quarters in the period ended october  this information is unaudited  but in our opinion reflects all adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments that we consider necessary for a fair statement of such information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures involves forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity 
we maintain a short term and long term investment portfolio 
see note to the financial statements in item of part ii of this report for information relating to the fair value of these investments 
these available for sale securities are subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value if market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at october   the fair value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
foreign currency exchange risk 
as a global concern  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
because our sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on sales has not been material 
our primary exposures are related to non us dollar denominated operating expense in canada  europe  india and china 
during fiscal  approximately of our operating expense was us dollar denominated 
as of october   our assets and liabilities related to non dollar denominated currencies were primarily related to intercompany payables and receivables 
we do not expect an increase or decrease of in the foreign exchange rate would have a material impact on our financial position 
to date  we have not significantly hedged against foreign currency fluctuations 
should exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency become more significant  however  we may pursue hedging alternatives
