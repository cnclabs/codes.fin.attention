the company intends that such forward looking statements be subject to the safe harbors created by section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of these forward looking statements involve numerous risks and unce rtainties that could cause our actual results to be materially different from those set forth in the forward looking statements including  without limitation  limitations on the area in which we may acquire properties  risks associated with borrowings secured by our properties  competition for tenants and customers  federal  state or local regulations  adverse changes in general economic or local conditions  competition for property acquisitions with third parties that have greater financial resources than we do  inability of lessees to meet financial obligations  uninsured losses and risks of failing to qualify as a real estate investment trust reit 
data in this section is presented in thousands  except per share data and square footage data 
this section provides the following an executive summary and our strategies and objectives  the critical accounting policies that impact the treatment  for financial statement purposes  of certain items such as how we value our investment properties  recognize rental income and depreciate our assets  a discussion of our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows and how the changes in balance sheet and cash flow items from year to year impact our liquidity and capital resources  a discussion of our results of operations  including changes in funds from operations ffo from year to year and a discussion of the impact that inflation may have on our results  and a discussion of the important factors that may impact your investment 
we have qualified as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code for federal income tax purposes commencing with the tax year ending december  so long as we qualify for treatment as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we meet the requirements of the tests imposed by the code 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate tax rates 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
additionally  in connection with the tax relief extension act of  which became effective january   we are permitted to participate in certain activities that were previously prohibited in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  so long as these activities are conducted in entities that elect to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries trs under the code  subject to certain limitations 
as such  the trs is subject to federal and state income taxes on the income from these activities 
executive summary we are an owner operator of neighborhood retail centers gross leasable areas ranging from  to  square feet and community centers gross leasable areas in excess of  square feet 
we are a self administered reit incorporated under maryland law 
we also may construct or develop properties or render services in connection with such development or construction 
as of december   we owned interests in investment properties  including those owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures 
essentially all of our revenues and cash flows are generated by collecting rental payments from our tenants 
our goal is to continue increasing our revenues by acquiring additional investment properties and re leasing those spaces that are vacant  or may become vacant  at more favorable rental rates 
we believe we have significant acquisition opportunities due to our reputation and our concentration of properties in the chicago and minneapolis st 
paul metropolitan areas 
we will use cash provided by our dividend reinvestment plan  proceeds from financings on previously unencumbered properties  draws on our line of credit and earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders to continue purchasing additional investment properties 
our largest expenses relate to the operation of our properties  depreciation and amortization and interest expense on our mortgages payable  line of credit and convertible notes 
our property operating expenses include  but are not limited to  real estate taxes  regular maintenance  landscaping  snow removal and periodic renovations to meet tenant needs 
pursuant to the lease agreements  tenants of the property are required to reimburse the company for some or all of the particular tenant s pro rata share of the real estate taxes and operating expenses of the property 
we consider ffo a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for a reit 
ffo provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to that of other reits 
due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies  nareit  an industry trade group  has promulgated a standard known as ffo  which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a reit such as ours 
as defined by nareit  ffo means net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures in which the reit holds an interest 
we have adopted the nareit definition for computing ffo 
management uses the calculation of ffo for several reasons 
we use ffo to compare our performance to that of other reits in our peer group 
additionally  ffo is used in certain employment agreements to determine incentives payable by us to certain executives  based on our performance 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity since capitalization and expense policies tend to vary from entity to entity 
items that are capitalized do not impact ffo whereas items that are expensed reduce ffo 
consequently  our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other reits 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by us gaap  it is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as determined in accordance with us gaap  for purposes of evaluating our operating performance 
we believe ebitda is useful to us and to an investor as a supplemental measure in evaluating our financial performance because it excludes expenses that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance 
ebitda is defined as earnings losses from continuing operations  calculated in accordance with us gaap  excluding interest expense  income tax benefit or expenses  depreciation and amortization 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance regardless of how we finance our operations and capital structure 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  we believe we can more accurately assess the performance of our portfolio 
because ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges such as interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements  it does not reflect the amount of capital needed to maintain our properties nor does it reflect trends in interest costs due to changes in interest rates or increases in borrowing 
ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net earnings and may be calculated differently by other equity reits 
we look at several factors to measure our operating performance to measure our operating results to those of other retail real estate owners operators in our area  we compare occupancy percentage  and our rental rates to the average rents charged by our competitors in similar centers 
to measure our operating results to those of other reits  we compare company wide growth in income or ffo  same store growth in income  and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of investment in properties 
based on the above measures  we have historically performed comparably with those in our property sector peer group 
there are costs and issues associated with re leasing our properties  including length of time required to fill vacancies  possibly re leasing at rental rates lower than current market rates  leasing costs associated with the new lease such as leasing commissions and tenant improvement allowances  and paying operating expenses without tenant reimbursements 
strategies and objectives our primary business objective is to enhance the performance and value of our investment properties through management strategies that address the needs of an evolving retail marketplace 
our commitment to operating our centers efficiently and effectively is  we believe  a direct result of our expertise in the acquisition  development re development  either directly or through a joint venture  management and leasing of our properties 
we focus on the following areas in order to achieve our objectives acquisitions we seek to selectively acquire well located open air retail centers 
we acquire properties either without financing contingencies or by assuming existing debt to provide us with a competitive advantage over other potential purchasers 
we concentrate our property acquisitions in areas where we have a large market concentration 
in doing this  we believe we are able to attract new retailers to the area and possibly lease several locations to them 
additionally  we are able to get existing retailers to lease more space at our current investment properties 
joint ventures we actively pursue new development opportunities through joint ventures with established local developers 
we have formed joint ventures to acquire stabilized retail properties as well as properties to be re developed and vacant land to be developed 
we earn fees from the joint ventures for providing property management  acquisition and leasing services 
we have formed a joint venture to acquire properties to offer tenant in common interests in properties to investors 
we earn fees from the joint venture for providing property management  acquisition and leasing services as well as syndication fees 
operations we actively manage costs to minimize operating expenses by centralizing all management  leasing  marketing  financing  accounting and data processing activities 
we improve rental income and cash flow by aggressively marketing rentable space 
we emphasize regular maintenance and periodic renovation to meet the needs of tenants and to maximize long term returns 
we maintain a diversified tenant base consisting primarily of retail tenants providing consumer goods and services 
we proactively review our existing portfolio for potential re development opportunities 
acquisitions and dispositions during the years ended december  and  we completed the following acquisitions and dispositions acquisitions during the year ended december  eight investment properties  totaling approximately  square feet  for approximately  in the aggregate  acres of vacant land through our joint venture with tmk development  ltd 
for approximately  vacant parcel of land at shakopee valley marketplace for approximately  and acres of vacant land through our joint ventures with north american real estate  inc for approximately  dispositions during the year ended december  acres of vacant land through our joint venture with tmk development ltd  and four investment properties 
total proceeds from these sales were approximately  acquisitions during the year ended december  six investment properties  totaling approximately  square feet for approximately  dispositions during the year ended december  three investment properties  partial sale of approximately  square feet at certain investment properties  one acre of vacant land at an existing investment property  and six investment properties contributed to our joint ventures with nystrs and tucker development corporation 
total proceeds from these sales were approximately  the acquisition price per square foot is higher in than it was in we believe that this does not reflect a market trend  but reflects solely the acquisition of algonquin commons  a lifestyle center  that was purchased for approximately per square foot 
this price is significantly higher than the amount per square foot that we typically pay for other centers  but is in line with the average price for lifestyle centers  based on comparable property sales 
critical accounting policies general a critical accounting policy is one that  we believe  would materially affect our operating results or financial condition  and requires management to make estimates or judgments in certain circumstances 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies relate to how we value our investment properties and determine whether assets are held for sale  recognize rental income and lease termination income  our cost capitalization and depreciation policies and consolidation equity accounting policies 
these judgments often result from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
us gaap requires information in financial statements about accounting principles  methods used and disclosures pertaining to significant estimates 
the following disclosure discusses judgments known to management pertaining to trends  events or uncertainties that were taken into consideration upon the application of critical accounting policies and the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported upon taking into consideration different conditions and assumptions 
valuation and allocation of investment properties 
on a quarterly basis  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 we review impairment indicators and  if necessary  conduct an impairment analysis to ensure that the carrying value of each investment property does not exceed its estimated fair value 
we evaluate our investment properties to assess whether any impairment indicators are present  including recurring operating losses and significant adverse changes in legal factors or business climate 
if an investment property is considered impaired  a loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
no such losses have been required or recorded in the accompanying financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and in determining the value of an investment property and whether the property is impaired  management considers several factors  such as projected rental and vacancy rates  property operating expenses  capital expenditures and interest rates 
the capitalization rate used to determine property valuation is based on the market in which the property is located  length of leases  tenant financial strength  the economy in general  demographics  environment  property location  visibility  age  physical condition and investor return requirements among others 
market capitalization rates fluctuate based on factors such as interest rates 
an increase in capitalization rates might result in a market valuation lower than our original purchase price 
additionally  we obtain an appraisal prepared by a third party at the time we purchase the investment property 
all of the aforementioned factors are considered by management in determining the value of any particular property 
the valu e of any particular property is sensitive to the actual results of any of these uncertain factors  either individually or taken as a whole 
should the actual results differ from management s judgment  the valuation could be negatively or positively affected 
we allocate the purchase price of each acquired investment property between land  building and improvements  other intangibles including acquired above market leases  acquired below market leases  customer relationships and acquired in place leases and any financing assumed that is determined to be above or below market terms 
the allocation of the purchase price is an area that requires complex judgments and significant estimates 
the value allocated to land as opposed to building affects the amount of depreciation expense we record 
if more value is attributed to land  depreciation expense is lower than if more value is attributed to building and improvements 
we use the information contained in the third party appraisals as the primary basis for allocating the purchase price between land  building and improvements 
we determine whether any financing assumed is above or below market based upon comparison to similar financing terms for similar inv estment properties 
the aggregate value of other intangibles is measured based on the difference between the purchase price and the property valued as if vacant 
we utilize information contained in independent appraisals and management s estimates to determine the respective as if vacant property values 
factors considered by management in our analysis of determining the as if vacant property value include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases and the risk adjusted cost of capital 
in estimating carrying costs  management includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  up to months 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  tenant improvements  legal and other related expenses 
we allocate the difference between the purchase price of the property and the as if vacant value first to acquired above and below market leases 
we evaluate each acquired lease based upon current market rates at the acquisition date and consider various factors including geographic location  size and location of leased space within the investment property  tenant profile and the credit risk of the tenant in determining whether the acquired lease is above or below market 
after an acquired lease is determined to be above or below market  we allocate a portion of the purchase price to the acquired above or below market lease based upon the present value of the difference between the contractual lease rate and the estimated market rate 
the determination of the discount rate used in the present value calculation is based upon a rate for each individual lease and primarily based upon the credit worthiness of each individual tenant 
the value of the acquired above and below market leases is amortized over the life of the related leases as an adjustment to rental income 
we then allocate the remaining difference to the value of acquired in place leases and customer relationships based on management s evaluation of specific leases and our overall relationship with the respective tenants 
the evaluation of acquired in place leases consists of a variety of components including the costs avoided associated with originating the acquired in place lease  including but not limited to  leasing commissions  tenant improvement costs and legal costs 
we also consider the value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs and rental income estimated to be incurred during the assumed re leasing period 
the value of the acquired in place lease is amortized over the average lease term as a component of amortization expense 
we also consider whether any customer relationship value exists related to the property acquisition 
as of december   we had not allocated any amounts to customer relationships 
the valuation and possible subsequent impairment in the value of our investment properties is a significant estimate that can and does change based on management s continuous process of analyzing each property 
cost capitalization and depreciation policies 
we review all expenditures and capitalize any item that is deemed to be an upgrade or a tenant improvement 
if we capitalize more expenditures  current depreciation expense would be higher  however  total current expenses would be lower 
depreciation expense is computed using the straight line method 
buildings and improvements are depreciated based upon estimated useful lives of years for buildings and improvements  years for site improvements and the remaining life of the related lease for tenant improvements 
assets held for sale 
in determining whether to classify an asset as held for sale  we consider whether i management has committed to a plan to sell the asset  ii the asset is available for immediate sale  in its present condition  iii we have initiated a program to locate a buyer  iv we believe that the sale of the asset is probable  v we have received a significant non refundable deposit for the purchase of the property  vi we are actively marketing the asset for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current value  and vii actions required for us to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that any significant changes will be made to the plan 
if all of the above criteria are met  we classify the asset as held for sale 
on the day that these criteria are met  we suspend depreciation on the assets held for sale  including depreciation for tenant improvements and additions  as well as on the amortization of acquired in place leases and customer relationship values 
the assets and liabilities associated with those assets that are held for sale are classified separately on the consolidated balance sheets for the most recent reporting period 
additionally  the operations for the periods presented are classified on the consolidated statements of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
recognition of rental income and tenant recoveries 
under us gaap  we are required to recognize rental income based on the effective monthly rent for each lease 
the effective monthly rent is equal to the average monthly rent during the term of the lease  not the stated rent for any particular month 
the process  known as straight lining rent  generally has the effect of increasing rental revenues during the early phases of a lease and decreasing rental revenues in the latter phases of a lease 
if rental income calculated on a straight line basis exceeds the cash rent due under the lease  the difference is recorded as an increase to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
if the cash rent due under the lease exceeds rental income calculated on a straight line basis  the difference is recorded as a decrease to both deferred rent receivable and rental income in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  we defer recognition of contingent rental income  such as percentage excess rent  until the specified target that triggers the contingent rental income is achieved 
we periodically review the collectibility of outstanding receivables 
allowances are taken for those balances that we deem to be uncollectible  including any amounts relating to straight line rent receivables 
tenant recoveries are primarily comprised of real estate tax and common area maintenance reimbursement income 
real estate tax income is based on an accrual reimbursement calculation by tenant  based on an estimate of current year real estate taxes 
as actual real estate tax bills are received  we reconcile with our tenants and adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
common area maintenance income is accrued on actual common area maintenance expenses as incurred 
annually  we reconcile with the tenants for their share of the expenses per their lease and we adjust prior year income estimates in the current period 
recognition of lease termination income 
we accrue lease termination income if there is a signed termination agreement  all of the conditions of the agreement have been met and the tenant is no longer occupying the property 
consolidation equity accounting policies 
we consolidate the operations of a joint venture if we determine that we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or have substantial influence and control of the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses or residual returns  or both 
there are significant judgments and estimates involved in determining the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or the determination of who has control and influence of the entity 
when we consolidate an entity  the assets  liabilities and results of operations of a variable interest entity are included in our consolidated financial statements 
in instances where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or we do not control the joint venture  we use the equity method of accounting 
under the equity method  the operations of a joint venture are not consolidated with our operations but instead our share of operations is reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures on our consolidated statement of operations 
additionally  our net investment in the joint venture is reflected as investment in and advances to joint venture as an asset on the consolidated balance sheets 
liquidity and capital resources this section describes our balance sheet and discusses our liquidity and capital commitments 
our most liquid asset is cash and cash equivalents which consists of cash and short term investments 
cash and cash equivalents at december  and were  and  respectively 
see our discussion of the statements of cash flows for a description of our cash activity during  and we consider all demand deposits  money market accounts and investments in certificates of deposit and repurchase agreements purchased with a maturity of three months or less  at the date of purchase  to be cash equivalents 
we maintain our cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions 
the combined account balances at one or more institutions periodically exceed the federal depository insurance corporation fdic insurance coverage and  as a result  there is a concentration of credit risk related to amounts on deposits in excess of fdic insurance covera ge 
we believe that the risk is not significant  as we do not anticipate the financial institutions non performance 
income generated from our investment properties is the primary source from which we generate cash 
the table below presents lease payments to be received in the future from properties that we owned as of december  minimum lease payments under operating leases to be received in the future  excluding rental income under master lease agreements and assuming no expiring leases are renewed are as follows thereafter total other sources of cash include amounts raised from the sale of securities under our dividend reinvestment plan drp  our draws on the line of credit with keybank na  which may be limited due to covenant compliance requirements  proceeds from financings secured by our investment properties and earnings we retain that are not distributed to our stockholders 
as of december   we had approximately  available under our  line of credit 
if necessary  such as for new acquisitions  we can generate cash flow by entering into financing arrangements or possible joint venture agreements with institutional investors 
during the year ended december   we issued  aggregate principal amount of convertible notes due in proceeds from the convertible notes were used to pay down our line of credit with keybank na by  and we also repurchased  shares of our common stock at a p rice equal to per share approximately  in the aggregate 
we use our cash primarily to pay distributions to our stockholders  for operating expenses at our investment properties  for purchasing additional investment properties  joint venture commitments and to repay draws on the line of credit 
certain joint venture commitments require us to invest cash in non operating property under development and in properties that do not necessarily meet our investment criteria but which are offered for syndication through our joint venture with inland real estate exchange corporation 
capital could be committed for periods longer than expected if development timelines are longer or syndication velocity is slower than anticipated 
as of december   we owned interests in investment properties  including those owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures 
of the investment properties owned  twenty five are currently unencumbered by any indebtedness 
we generally limit our secured indebtedness to approximately of the original purchase price  or current market value if higher  of the investment properties in the aggregate 
these twenty five unencumbered investment properties were purchased for an aggregate purchase price of approximately  and would therefore yield at least  in additional cash from financing  using this standard 
in the aggregate  all of our investment properties are currently generating sufficient cash flow to pay our operating expenses  debt service requirements and distributions equal to per share on an annual basis 
as of december   the required future principal payments on our mortgages payable  including our line of credit and convertible notes over the next five years and thereafter are as follows a thereafter b total a included in the debt maturing during is our line of credit with keybank na this line of credit requires compliance with certain covenants  such as debt service ratios  minimum net worth requirements  distribution limitations and investment restrictions 
as of december   we were in compliance with such covenants 
b included in the debt maturing in the thereafter total is our convertible notes issued during  which mature in the following table summarizes our consolidated statements of cash flows for the years ended december   and net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities statements of cash flows compared to cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  decreased  as compared to the year ended december  in  the cash provided by operating activities was impacted by the receipt of a one time lease termination fee in the amount of  from dominick s finer food to terminate its lease at the highland park location received during the year ended december  this fee is included in lease termination income on our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  this decrease in cash provided by operating activities is partially offset by cash flows from operations generated by properties acquired during and  subsequent to the dates of their acquisitions and distributions received from the operations of our joint ventures 
net cash used in investing activities increased by  as we acquired six investment properties during the year ended december  at a cost of  completed  in additions to our investment properties and generated  of disposition proceeds  as compared to the acquisition of six investment properties during the year ended december  at a cost of  additions to our investment properties totaling  and generating  of disposition proceeds 
during the year ended december   we invested approximately  to purchase land and one investment property in our joint ventures 
cash used in investing activities also increased due to an increase in our mortgages receivable 
the increase in mortgages receivable is due to additional draws on our receivable from tri land properties  inc as well as from our participation in a note receivable with inland american real estate trust  inc  an affiliate of the inland group  inc additio nally  we received less cash distributions from our joint ventures and used less cash to purchase investment securities during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities was  during the year ended december   as compared to net cash used in financing activities of  during the year ended december  this increase in cash is due primarily to the proceeds received from the convertible notes issued during additionally  we used less cash to repay debt during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by financing activities was offset by the use of additional cash to repurchase shares in relation to our convertible note offering and to purchase the minority interest units in one of our joint ventures 
additionally  we received less cash from loan proceeds during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  compared to cash provided by operating activities increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due primarily to distributions received from the operations of our unconsolidated joint ventures 
this increase is offset by a decrease in cash received from the contribution of the properties to our joint ventures during we received cash from operations of the contributed properties for the year ended december  net cash used in investing activities decreased by  as we acquired six investment properties during the year ended december  at a cost of  and generating  of disposition proceeds  as compared to the acquisition of six investment properties during the year ended december  at a cost of  and generating  of disposition proceeds 
additionally  we received  in distributions from our joint ventures and used more cash to purchase investment securities during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities was  for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december   as we used more cash to payoff debt and pay loan fees on new debt  which was offset by less cash used to pay down our line of credit 
additionally  during the year ended december   we received less proceeds from shares issued under our drp 
contractual obligations the table below presents our obligations and commitments to make future payments under debt obligations and lease agreements as of the year ended december  contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt line of credit convertible notes office lease interest expense a a interest expense on the convertible notes was calculated through the first date at which we are able to call the notes 
results of operations this section describes and compares our results of operations for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had ownership interests in single user retail properties  neighborhood retail centers and community centers 
we generate almost all of our net operating income from property operations 
in order to evaluate our overall portfolio  management analyzes the operating performance of properties that we have owned and operated for the same twelve month periods during each year 
a total of of our investment properties satisfied these criteria during the periods presented and are referred to herein as same store properties 
these properties comprise approximately million square feet 
a total of fifteen investment properties  those that have been acquired during the years ended december   and are presented as other investment properties qu ot  in the table below 
the same store investment properties represent approximately of the square footage of our portfolio at december  this analysis allows management to monitor the operations of our existing properties for comparable periods to measure the performance of our current portfolio 
additionally  we are able to determine the effects of our new acquisitions on net income 
net income available to common stockholders and net income available to common stockholder per weighted average common share for the years ended december   and are summarized below net income available to common stockholders net income available to common stockholders per weighted average common shares basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted net income decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the years ended december  the decrease in net income is primarily due to additional non cash depreciation and amortization expense on a larger portfolio of properties 
additionally  the decrease is due to large one time lease termination fees received during the years ended december  and in comparison to minimal fees received during the year ended december  the following table presents the operating results  broken out between same store and other investment properties  prior to straight line rental income  interest  depreciation  amortization and bad debt expense for the years ended december   and along with reconciliation to income from continuing operations  calculated in accordance with us gaap

in comparing the results of operations from the same store properties during the years ended december  and  property net operating income increased by  with total rental income and tenant recoveries increasing by  and total property operating expenses increasing by  total rental income and tenant recoveries for the year ended december  was  as compared to  for the year ended december  the primary reason for this decreased was a decrease in rental income and tenant recoveries due to the contribution of investment properties to the new york state teachers retirement systems nystrs joint venture during and  which was partially offset by new acquisitions during the year ended december  the following table presents our top ten tenants based on percentage of total square footage  along with their respective annual base rent  percentage of annual base rent and approximate receivable balance as of december  tenant name a percentage of total square footage annual base rent percentage of annual base rent receivable balance at december  supervalue dominick s finer foods tjx companies  inc roundy s k mart petsmart kohl s department stores kroger wickes furniture office depot total a the table above includes properties owned through our unconsolidated joint ventures 
lease termination income was approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the primary reason for the increase in was the receipt of a lease termination fee of  from dominick s finer foods with respect to the lease at their location in highland park  illinois 
total property operating expenses  including real estate taxes  for the year ended december  decreased  as compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for the decrease is a decrease in common area and grounds maintenance expenses on our same store portfolio of properties 
the decrease is due in most part to lower snow removal costs in  as compared to additionally  during the year ended december   we entered into an agreement with a limited liability company formed as an insurance association captive in order to reduce our premium paid for our annual insurance policies 
total property operating expenses  including real estate taxes  for the year ended december  decreased  as compared to the year ended december  the primary reason for this decrease was a decrease of  in expenses associated with the other investment properties due to the contributions of investment properties to our unconsolidated joint ventures during and stock exchange listing expenses decreased for the years ended december  and  as compared to the year ended december  we incurred approximately in expenses related to our listing on the new york stock exchange nyse during the year ended december  this included travel expenses related to the road show  legal fees  approximately for the engagement of an investment banking firm to assist with the listing and the initial nyse listing fee 
during the years ended december  and  we paid approximately and  respectively for our annual listing 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is due primarily to an increase in salaries and other payroll related items  board of director fees and professional fees related to acquisition activity during general and administrative expenses increased approximately for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this is due to an increase in salaries and other payroll related items as well as additional accounting fees for our continued compliance with requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of sarbanes oxley 
this increase was offset by decreases related to investor service costs incurred in in relation to our certificate exchange program and lower fees paid for data processing services in there were additional services necessary in for our sarbanes oxley compliance that were not necessary in other income increased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to several factors interest received on our mortgages receivable increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  due to higher outstanding balances on our loan to tri land properties  inc as well as income received on our participation in a note receivable from inland american real estate trust  inc  an affiliate of the inland group  inc dividend income received on our investment in securities increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  gains on the sale of our investment in securities increased for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december other income decreased for the year ended december   as compared to the years ended december  this decrease is due to a decrease in gains recorded in on the sale of our investment in securities 
interest expense increased approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this increase is due in most part to interest paid on our line of credit with keybank na during the year ended december  this is the result of higher balances maintained throughout the year as well as a higher rate charged on the outstanding balances 
additionally  interest expense increased due to the convertible notes that we issued during we issued these convertible notes in order to take advantage of lower interest rates going forward 
these notes are fixed at a rate of per annum 
in connection with the issuance of the notes  we repaid  of the outstanding balance on our line of credit  which had an interest rate of 
interest expense decreased  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this is primarily due to the contribution of properties into the joint ventures that occurred in and our portion of the interest expense for these properties is included in equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures decreased approximately  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  this decrease is due in most part to our share of the non cash expenses related to the properties held in our joint ventures 
this decrease is offset by increases in operations due to properties newly acquired by the joint ventures during the year ended december  equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased approximately  for the year ended december   as compare to the year ended december  our largest joint venture was formed in december therefore  there were minimal operations recorded by the joint venture during captive insurance effective october   we entered into an agreement with a limited liability company formed as an insurance association captive captive  which is wholly owned by three other entities previously sponsored by inland real estate investment corporation inland retail real estate trust  inc  inland western retail real estate trust  inc 
and inland american real estate trust  inc and us 
inland risk insurance management services  inc  an affiliate of the inland group  inc  provides services to the captive 
the captive was formed to more efficiently manage the respective insurance coverage of the members and the premiums associated with property casualty coverage 
the captive will annually oversee the purchase of one or more insurance policies from a third party insurer that cover properties of its members that will be acceptable to all members 
portions of these insurance policies agreed upon by all members will be funded or reimbursed by insurance policies purchas ed from the captive by the members 
the premium associated with the non catastrophic property and casualty insurance policies purchased from the captive will be divided amongst each of the members based upon a determination by a third party  independent actuary of the losses  loss reserves and loss expenses that each member is expected to incur and a proportional allocation of associated operating costs 
each member initially contributed approximately to the captive in the form of a capital contribution and could be required to make annual contributions to fund the loss reserve 
the captive will use this capital to pay a portion of certain property and casualty losses and general liability losses suffered by a member under the policies purchased by the captive subject to deductibles applicable to each occurrence 
these losses will be paid by the captive up to and including a certain dollar limit per occurrence  after which the losses are covered by the third party insurer 
we are required to remain as a member of the captive for a period of five years even if insurance rates from third party providers are lower than what we get through the captive 
although our current year policy premium remained consistent with prior premiums  had we not entered the captive  we could have seen larger increases than we had experienced in the past 
joint ventures consolidated joint ventures are those where we are either the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or have substantial influence over or control the entity 
the primary beneficiary is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected residual returns and losses 
the third parties interests in these consolidated entities are reflected as minority interest in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
all inter company balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
off balance sheet arrangements unconsolidated real estate joint ventures unconsolidated joint ventures are those where we are not the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity or have substantial influence over but do not control the entity 
we account for our interest in these ventures using the equity method of accounting 
pertinent information related to these ventures is summarized in the following table venture partner company s ownership percentage december  december  crow holdings managers  llc new york state teachers retirement system north american real estate  inc north american real estate  inc oak property and casualty inland real estate exchange corporation investment in and advances to unconsolidated joint ventures our proportionate share of the earnings or losses related to these ventures is reflected as equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures on the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
additionally  we earn fees for providing property management  leasing and acquisition activities to these ventures 
we recognize only our share of these fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the operations of properties contributed by us are not recorded as discontinued operations because of our continuing involvement with these shopping centers 
differences between our investment in the joint ventures and the amount of the underlying equity in net assets of the joint ventures are due to basis differences resulting from our equity investment recorded at its historical basis versus the fair value of certain of our contributions to the joint venture 
such differences are amortized over depreciable lives of the joint venture s property assets 
during the year ended december  and  we recorded  and  respectively  of amortization of this basis difference 
no such amortization was recorded during the year ended december  non gaap financial measures we consider ffo a widely accepted and appropriate measure of performance for a reit 
ffo provides a supplemental measure to compare our performance and operations to other reits 
due to certain unique operating characteristics of real estate companies  nareit has promulgated a standard known as ffo  which it believes more accurately reflects the operating performance of a reit such as ours 
as defined by nareit  ffo means net income computed in accordance with us gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating property  plus depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnership and joint ventures in which the reit holds an interest 
we have adopted the nareit definition for computing ffo 
management uses the calculation of ffo for several reasons 
we use ffo to compare our performance to that of other reits in our peer group 
additionally  ffo is used in certain employment agreements to determine i ncentives payable by us to certain executives  based on our performance 
the calculation of ffo may vary from entity to entity since capitalization and expense policies tend to vary from entity to entity 
items that are capitalized do not impact ffo whereas items that are expensed reduce ffo 
consequently  our presentation of ffo may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures presented by other reits 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by us gaap  it is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to pay distributions and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  as determined in accordance with us gaap  for purposes of evaluating our operating performance 
the following table reflects our ffo for the periods presented  reconciled to net income available to common stockholders for these periods for the year ended december  for the year ended december  for the year ended december  net income available to common stockholders gain on sale of investment properties  net of minority interest gain on non operating property  net of minority interest equity in depreciation of unconsolidated joint ventures amortization on in place lease intangibles amortization on leasing commissions depreciation  net of minority interest funds from operations net income available to common stockholders per weighted average common share  basic and diluted funds from operations  per weighted average common share  basic and diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding  basic weighted average number of common shares outstanding  diluted we believe ebitda is useful to us and to an investor as a supplemental measure in evaluating our financial performance because it excludes expenses that we believe may not be indicative of our operating performance 
ebitda is defined as earnings losses from operations excluding interest expense  income tax benefit or expenses  depreciation and amortization 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance regardless of how we finance our operations and capital structure 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  we believe we can more accurately assess the performance of our portfolio 
because ebitda is calculated before recurring cash charges such as interest expense and taxes and is not adjusted for capital expenditures or other recurring cash requirements  it does not reflect the amount of capital needed to maintain our properties nor does it reflect trends in interest costs due to c hanges in interest rates or increases in borrowing 
ebitda should be considered only as a supplement to net earnings and may be calculated differently by other equity reits

inflation our long term leases contain provisions to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation on our operating results 
such provisions include clauses entitling us to receive scheduled base rent increases and base rent increases based upon the consumer price index 
in addition  the majority of our leases require tenants to pay operating expenses  including maintenance  real estate taxes  insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in cost and operating expenses resulting from inflation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   and we had no derivative instruments 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we may designate these derivative financial instruments as hedges and apply hedge accounting  as the instrument to be hedged will expose us to interest rate risk  and the derivative financial instrument will reduce that exposure 
if a derivative terminates or is sold  the gain or loss is recognized 
we will only enter into derivative transactions that satisfy the aforementioned criteria 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the fact that some of our long term debt consists of variable interest rate loans 
we seek to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower our overall borrowing costs by closely monitoring our variable rate debt and converting such debt to fixed rates when we deem such conversion advantageous 
our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques  including periodically evaluating fixed interest rate quotes on all variable rate debt and the costs associated with converting the debt to fixed rate debt 
also  existing fixed and variable rate loans that are scheduled to mature in the next year or two are evaluated for possible early refinancing and or extension due to consideration given to current interest rates 
the table below presents the principal amount of the debt maturing each year  including monthly annual amortization of principal  through december  and thereafter and weighted average interest rates for the debt maturing in each specified period 
thereafter total fixed rate debt weighted average interest rate variable rate debt weighted average interest rate the table above reflects indebtedness outstanding as of december   and does not reflect indebtedness incurred after that date 
our ultimate exposure to interest rate fluctuations depends on the amount of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates  the time at which the interest rate is adjusted  the amount of the adjustment  our ability to prepay or refinance variable rate indebtedness and hedging strategies used to reduce the impact of any increases in rates 
the fair value of mortgages payable is the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties 
the fair value of our mortgages  including our line of credit  is estimated to be  for mortgages which bear interest at variable rates and  for mortgages which bear interest at fixed rates 
we estimate the fair value of our mortgages payable by discounting the future cash flows of each instrument at rates currently offered to us for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities by our lenders 
at december   approximately  or of our mortgages payable  have variable interest rates averaging 
an increase in the variable interest rates charged on mortgages payable containing variable interest rate terms  constitutes a market risk 
a annualized increase in interest rates would have increased our interest expense by approximately
