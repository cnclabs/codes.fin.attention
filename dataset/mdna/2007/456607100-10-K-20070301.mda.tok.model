item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk factors that may affect future results above for further discussion of risks 
we utilize a variety of means in order to manage interest rate risk 
we invest in msrs and aaa rated and agency interest only securities to generate core interest and fee income 
the value of these instruments and the income they provide tends to be counter cyclical to the changes in production volumes and gain on sale of loans that result from changes in interest rates 
with regard to the pipeline of mortgage loans held for sale  in general  we hedge this asset with forward commitments to sell fannie mae or freddie mac securities of comparable maturities and weighted average interest rates 
to hedge our investments in msrs  aaa rated and agency interest only and residual securities  we use several strategies  including buying and or selling mortgage backed or us treasury securities  forward rate agreements  futures  floors  swaps  or options  depending on several factors 
lastly  we enter into swap agreements and utilize fhlb advances to mitigate interest rate risk on mortgage loans held for investment 
in connection with all of the above strategies  we use hedging instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate risk  not to speculate on the direction of market interest rates 
a primary measurement tool used to evaluate risk is an npv analysis 
an npv analysis simulates the effects of an instantaneous change in interest rates in a variety of basis point increments on our assets and liabilities  commitments and hedges 
the result is an estimate of the increase or decrease to net portfolio value 
see item management s discussion and analysis interest rate sensitivity for a further discussion of our npv analysis
