item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this narrative will assist readers in their analysis of the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplemental financial information of the company 
it should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes on pages through effective october   national commerce financial corporation ncf merged with suntrust 
the results of operations for ncf were included with suntrust s results beginning october  prior periods do not reflect the impact of the merger 
in management s discussion and analysis  net interest income  net interest margin and the efficiency ratio are presented on a fully taxable equivalent fte basis and the ratios are presented on an annualized basis 
the fte basis adjusts for the tax favored status of income from certain loans and investments 
the company believes this measure to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income and it enhances comparability of net interest income arising from taxable and tax exempt sources 
the company also presents diluted earnings per common share excluding merger expense and an efficiency ratio excluding merger expense that exclude merger charges related to the ncf acquisition 
the company believes the exclusion of the merger charges  which represent incremental costs to integrate ncf s operations  is more reflective of normalized operations 
additionally  the company presents a return on average realized common shareholders equity  as well as a return on average common shareholders equity roe 
the company also presents a return on average assets less net unrealized securities gains losses and a return on average total assets roa 
the return on average realized common shareholders equity and return on average assets less net unrealized securities gains losses exclude realized securities gains and losses  the coca cola company dividend  and net unrealized securities gains 
due to its ownership of approximately million shares of common stock of the coca cola company  resulting in an unrealized net gain of billion as of december   the company believes roa and roe excluding these impacts from the company s securities portfolio is the more comparative performance measure when being evaluated against other companies 
suntrust presents a tangible efficiency ratio and a tangible equity to tangible assets ratio which exclude the cost of and the other effects of intangible assets resulting from merger and acquisition m a activity 
the company believes these measures are useful to investors because  by removing the effect of intangible asset costs and merger and acquisition activity the level of which may vary from company to company  it allows investors to more easily compare the company s efficiency and capital adequacy to other companies in the industry 
the measures are utilized by management to assess the efficiency of the company and its lines of business as well as the capital adequacy of the company 
the company provides reconcilements on pages and for all non us gaap measures 
certain reclassifications may be made to prior period financial statements and related information to conform them to the presentation 
suntrust reported net income available to common shareholders of  million  or per diluted common share for the year ended december  for the fourth quarter of  suntrust reported net income available to common shareholders of million or per diluted common share 
these results have been revised from the earnings results the company reported in its january  earnings release in which the company reported net income available to common shareholders of  million  or per diluted common share for the year ended december  and net income available to common shareholders of million  or per diluted common share for the fourth quarter ended december  the reduction in earnings relates to a million increase in the provision for loan losses associated with the previously disclosed large commercial credit 
subsequent to year end  the company continued to work with the borrower associated with this large commercial credit to identify all possible sources of repayment 
as of december  and at the time of the earnings release  the company had recorded a specific reserve which reflected management s best estimate of the expected loss based on information available at that time 
in february  certain events occurred which resulted in a reduction of management s estimate of the net realizable amount of the loan 
on february   the borrower signed a definitive agreement to sell the majority of its assets  primarily customer contracts  to an unrelated third party at a value that was less than previously estimated due in large part to a reduction in the borrower s revenues after december  as a result of the sale of the majority of the borrower s assets  the large commercial credit was partially repaid and the remainder of the company s exposure to this borrower was charged off 
this resulted in an additional million in provision for loan losses and a million charge off 
suntrust provided the financing to the purchaser 
the company believes the purchaser is financially stable  and the new financing reflects market terms and conditions 
the terms of the definitive sale agreement include a component of contingent consideration of approximately million  based on the future performance of the purchased customer contracts 
the performance period ends during the third quarter of the contingent portion of the purchase was structured under a separate note 
since the ultimate amount of repayment on this note is based on the future performance of the purchased customer contracts  the note is classified as non accrual and the company recorded a specific reserve based on the estimated amount of consideration to be received 
nonperforming loans declined million as a result of the definitive agreement and new financing 
management evaluated these events and determined that in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles that it was necessary to reflect these revisions to the estimated net realizable amount of the loan in its financial statements since these subsequent events occurred prior to the filing of the company s annual report on form k 
the revision to management s estimate subsequent to year end does not constitute a control deficiency 
rather  it is a reflection of the extremely fluid nature of the workout activities associated with this large commercial credit and specific events which took place subsequent to year end 
all of the financial information included in the company s annual report on form k has been updated to reflect these revisions 
introduction suntrust is headquartered in atlanta  georgia  and operates primarily within florida  georgia  maryland  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  virginia  and the district of columbia 
within the geographic footprint  suntrust strategically operates under five business segments 
these business segments are retail  commercial  corporate and investment banking cib  wealth and investment management  and mortgage 
despite a challenging operating environment in  which included fierce deposit competition and a prolonged flat to inverted yield curve  suntrust was able to grow diluted earnings per common share by over loans  deposits and our overall customer base continued to grow in  which reflects our intense focus on sales and client service 
as the year progressed and market conditions became increasingly difficult  we were able to overcome the negative impact the yield curve had on net interest income with strong fee income growth and by ratcheting up expense control 
the company also instituted an efficiency and productivity program in the second half of which we expect to yield significant benefits over the next several years 
the efficiency and productivity initiatives  coupled with our sales and service focus and strong credit culture  provide momentum going into and beyond 
the following is a summary of the company s financial performance total revenue fte increased million  or  compared to noninterest income sources contributed million  or of the increase  led by strong mortgage production and servicing income while net interest income fte contributed million  or of the increase 
net interest income fte increased million  or  however the net interest margin declined basis points to 
the margin decline was the result of the flat to inverted yield curve experienced throughout which compressed interest rate spreads on earning assets 
the average earning asset yield increased basis points compared to while the average interest bearing liability cost increased basis points  resulting in a basis point decline in interest rate spread 
additionally  there was a shift in the mix of deposits to higher cost products  with certificates of deposits increasing  while other deposit products  specifically dda  money market  and savings  declined 
noninterest income improved million  or  compared to the increase was driven by strong mortgage production and servicing income and gain on the sale of the bond trustee business 
noninterest expense increased million  or  compared to the increase was driven by higher personnel costs due to increased headcount  normal merit raises  and higher benefits cost 
net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was for and included the charge off of a large commercial loan that was determined to be nonperforming in the third quarter of this credit was the primary driver of an million  or  increase in provision for loan losses compared to nonperforming assets increased million compared to december  due primarily to an increase in residential real estate nonperforming loans  which was driven mainly by the maturation of this portfolio  and more specifically in well collateralized or insured conforming and alt a first mortgage loans

the net interest margin decreased basis points to in due to spread compression from the continued flat to inverted yield curve 
an overall decline in low cost deposits  as well as a shift in the deposit mix to higher cost certificates of deposit also contributed to the decrease 
continuation or acceleration of this trend in customer preferences for higher yielding deposits and a prolonged flat to inverted yield curve  or other external factors  could have a further negative impact on net interest margin in future periods 
the company has incorporated initiatives to mitigate further margin compression with an emphasis on growing lower cost deposits 
while both short term and long term interest rates have risen for the last year  the yield curve has flattened considerably 
the federal reserve bank fed funds rate averaged for  an increase of basis points over the average  and one month libor increased basis points to average in in contrast  the five year swap rate averaged  an increase of basis points over the average  and the ten year swap rate increased basis points over the same time period to an average rate of

the new methodology segregates the portfolio into sub portfolios and incorporates a weighted average of expected loss derived from an internal risk rating system

in and prior periods  the allocation reflected an apportionment of the alll that had been categorized as environmental factors  which is now included in the company s homeogeneous loan pool estimates

additionally impacting loan growth was strong demand for construction lending resulting in a billion  or  increase in construction loans compared to december  the majority of the company s construction portfolio is residential real estate related which typically requires minimum pre sales and equity from the borrower 
the construction lending portfolio has minimal exposure to speculative condo investor activity 
commercial loans increased billion  or  from december   driven by increased corporate demand and growth in lease financing 
loans held for sale  which predominantly consists of warehoused mortgage loans  were billion  a decrease of billion  or  from december  the decrease was attributable to loan sales exceeding the origination of loans held for sale due in part to the interest rate and housing market environments in allowance for loan and lease losses suntrust continuously monitors the quality of its loan portfolio and maintains an allowance for loan and lease losses alll sufficient to absorb probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio 
the company is committed to the early recognition of problem loans and to an appropriate and adequate level of allowance 
at year end  the company s total allowance was billion  which represented of period end loans 
in addition to the review of credit quality through ongoing credit review processes  the company employs a variety of modeling and estimation tools for measuring credit risk that are used to construct an appropriate alll 
the company s allowance framework has three basic elements a formula based component for pools of homogeneous loans  specific allowances for loans reviewed for individual impairment  and an unallocated component that is based on other inherent risk factors and imprecision associated with modeling and estimation processes 
this framework enables the company to better align loss estimation practices with the different types of credit risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
the first element the general allowance for homogeneous loan pools is determined by applying allowance factors to pools of loans within the portfolio that have similar characteristics in terms of line of business and product type 
the general allowance factors are determined using a baseline factor that is developed from an analysis of historical charge off experience and expected losses 
expected losses are based on estimated probabilities of default and losses given default derived from an internal risk rating process 
these baseline factors are developed and applied to the various loan pools 
adjustments are made to the baseline factor for specific loan pools based on an assessment of internal and external influences on credit quality that are not fully reflected in the historical loss or risk rating data 
these influences may include elements such as changes in credit underwriting or recent observable asset quality trends 
finally  the baseline factors are adjusted using a number of models which are intended to compensate for internal and external portfolio influences that may not be captured in the adjusted baseline factors 
the company continually evaluates its allowance methodology seeking to refine and enhance this process as appropriate  and it is likely that the methodology will evolve over time 
as of december  and  the general allowance calculations totaled million and million  respectively 
the increase was due to loan growth and higher allowance factors associated with residential mortgage products  partially offset by lower allowance factors associated with corporate banking products 
the second element of the alll analysis involves the estimation of allowances specific to individual impaired loans 
in this process  specific allowances are established for nonaccruing commercial and residential loans greater than million based on a thorough analysis of the most probable sources of repayment  including discounted future cash flows  liquidation of collateral  or the market value of the loan itself 
as of december  and  the specific allowance related to impaired loans totaled million and million  respectively 
the third element of the allowance is the unallocated reserve that addresses inherent losses that are not otherwise evaluated in the first two elements 
the qualitative factors of this third allowance element are subjective and require a high degree of management judgment 
these factors include the inherent imprecision in mathematical models  recent economic uncertainty  losses incurred from recent events  and lagging or incomplete data 
as of december  and  the allowance estimated in the third element totaled million and million  respectively 
the company s charge off policy meets or exceeds regulatory minimums 
losses on unsecured consumer loans are recognized at days past due compared to the regulatory loss criteria of days 
secured consumer loans  including residential real estate  are typically charged off between and days  depending on the collateral type  in compliance with ffiec guidelines 
commercial loans and real estate loans are typically placed on non accrual when principal or interest is past due for days or more unless the loan is both secured by collateral having realizable value sufficient to discharge the debt in full and the loan is in the legal process of collection 
accordingly  secured loans may be charged down to the estimated value of the collateral with previously accrued unpaid interest reversed 
subsequent charge offs may be required as a result of changes in the market value of collateral or other repayment prospects 
the ratio of the allowance for loan and lease losses to total nonperforming loans decreased to as of december  from as of december  the decline in this ratio was due to a million increase in nonperforming loans driven primarily by a million increase in residential mortgage nonperforming loans 
the increase in residential mortgage nonperforming loans was driven mainly by maturation of this portfolio  predominantly in well collateralized or insured conforming and alternative mortgage products that have an average loan to value below 
in addition to reserves held in the alll  the company had million and million in other liabilities as of december  and  respectively that represents a reserve against certain unfunded commitments  including letters of credit

when a loan is placed on nonaccrual  unpaid interest is reversed against interest income 
interest income on nonaccrual loans  if recognized  is either recorded using the cash basis method of accounting or recognized at the end of the loan after the principal has been reduced to zero  depending on the type of loan 
if and when a nonaccrual loan is returned to accruing status  the accrued interest at the date the loan is placed on nonaccrual status  and foregone interest during the nonaccrual period  are recorded as interest income only after all principal has been collected for commercial loans

the company managed the portfolio in with the goal of continuing to improve yield while reducing the size to partially fund loan growth and reduce the company s use of wholesale funding 
consistent with this goal  the company restructured a portion of the investment portfolio during the latter half of as part of the restructuring  the company sold billion of shorter term securities across several categories  namely mortgage backed and agency securities  with a yield and reinvested approximately billion in longer term securities with a yield 
in addition to reinvesting in these securities  billion of receive fixed interest rate swaps on commercial loans were executed at to extend the duration of the balance sheet and improve the earning asset yield 
securities losses of million were realized in conjunction with the restructuring 
these losses represented approximately of the securities sold 
the underlying securities began gradually incurring unrealized losses approximately two years ago in connection with the increase in interest rates 
the company s analysis indicated that the combination of these steps were sufficient to achieve its current asset liability management objectives 
the company continues to monitor economic and company specific performance in order to determine if incremental balance sheet management tactics are appropriate

the size of the securities portfolio decreased billion to billion  or  of total assets at december   down from billion or of total assets at december  net securities losses of million were realized during  primarily due to the repositioning of the securities portfolio  but were partially offset by gains realized on equity positions sold by the company in net securities losses realized for the year ended december  were million compared to net losses of million realized for the year ended december  the current mix of securities as of december  is shown in table the carrying value of the investment portfolio  all of which is classified as securities available for sale  reflected billion in net unrealized gains at december   including a billion unrealized gain on the company s investment in common stock of the coca cola company 
the net unrealized gain of this common stock investment increased million  while the net unrealized loss on the remainder of the portfolio of million  or of amortized cost  improved million compared to december  these changes in market value did not affect the net income of suntrust  but were included in other comprehensive income 
the company reviews all of its securities with unrealized losses for impairment at least quarterly

deposits table composition of average deposits year ended december percent of total dollars in millions noninterest bearing now accounts money market accounts savings consumer time other time total consumer and commercial deposits brokered deposits foreign deposits total deposits average consumer and commercial deposits were billion  an increase of billion  or  compared to the growth was exclusively in higher cost consumer time and other time deposits 
specifically  consumer time and other time deposits increased billion  or  and were offset by declines in money market  savings  and noninterest bearing dda account balances 
money market accounts declined billion  or  savings accounts declined billion  or  and noninterest bearing dda account balances declined billion  or 
the decline in these products was the result of deposit migration to higher cost time deposits as well as customers moving balances to alternative investments such as repurchase agreements or money market mutual funds to take advantage of higher interest rates 
average brokered and foreign deposits were billion  an increase of billion  or  compared to the increase was due to the company s reliance on these wholesale funding sources to fund earning asset growth not supported by consumer and commercial deposit growth 
earning asset growth funded by higher cost wholesale borrowing have narrower spreads resulting in lower net interest income than incremental earning asset growth supported by consumer and commercial deposits 
consumer and commercial deposit growth is a key initiative for the company  as it focuses on deposit gathering opportunities across all lines business throughout the geographic footprint 
the company has already instituted a number of initiatives to attract deposits 
these initiatives include the modification of incentive plans to place greater emphasis on deposit and package account sales  enhancing online banking products and partnering with other well known brands in deposit oriented promotions 
as of the end of these initiatives had not yielded meaningful results 
capital resources the company s primary regulator  the federal reserve  measures capital adequacy within a framework that makes capital requirements sensitive to the risk profiles of individual banking companies 
the guidelines weigh assets and off balance sheet risk exposures risk weighted assets according to predefined classifications  creating a base from which to compare capital levels 
tier capital primarily includes realized equity and qualified preferred instruments  less purchase accounting intangibles such as goodwill and core deposit intangibles 
total capital consists of tier capital and tier capital  which includes qualifying portions of subordinated debt  allowance for loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets  and of the unrealized gain on equity securities 
the company and suntrust bank the bank are subject to a minimum tier risk based capital and total capital ratios of and  respectively  of risk weighted assets

in conjunction with the issuance of the preferred purchase securities  million of junior subordinated debentures with a year initial maturity were issued 
the junior subordinated debt will be remarketed after five years and the company can defer interest on the debentures for up to seven years 
also  the company entered into a forward purchase contract which provides for the issuance of million of preferred stock following the successful remarketing of the junior subordinated debt  but in any case no later than december  the preferred stock will be callable immediately after issuance at the option of the company 
in conjunction with the issuance of the enhanced trust preferred securities  billion of junior subordinated debentures were issued that initially mature in the proceeds from the series a perpetual preferred stock and preferred purchase securities totaling approximately billion  were used to repurchase billion in outstanding common stock of the company  with million repurchased through an accelerated share repurchase initiated in october of in the fourth quarter of the company also exercised its right to call billion of higher cost trust preferred securities and issued the aforementioned billion of lower cost  more efficient enhanced trust preferred securities  lowering the company s overall cost of capital

moreover  the company has policies and various risk management processes designed to effectively identify  monitor and manage risk 
management continually refines and enhances its risk management policies  processes and procedures to maintain effective risk management and governance  including identification  measurement  monitoring  control  mitigation and reporting of all material risks 
over the last few years  the company has enhanced risk measurement applications and systems capabilities that provide management information on whether the company is being appropriately compensated for the risk profile it has adopted 
the company balances its strategic goals  including revenue and profitability objectives  with the risks associated with achieving its goals 
effective risk management is an important element supporting business decision making at suntrust 
enterprise risk management s focus is on synthesizing  assessing  reporting and mitigating the full set of risks at the enterprise level  providing senior management with a holistic picture of the organization s risk profile 
the company implemented an enterprise risk management framework that will improve the company s ability to manage its aggregate risk profile 
at the core of the framework are suntrust s risk vision and mission 
risk vision to deliver sophisticated risk management capabilities consistent with those of top tier financial institutions that support the needs of the business  enable risk enlightened management and the optimal allocation of capital 
risk mission to promote a strong risk management culture which facilitates accountability  risk informed decisions consistent with the bank s strategic objectives and the creation of shareholder value 
the company s chief risk officer cro reports to the chief executive officer and is responsible for the oversight of the risk management organization as well as risk governance processes 
the cro provides overall leadership  vision and direction for the company s enterprise risk management framework 
in addition to the centralized enterprise risk management function  each line of business and corporate function has its own risk manager and support staff 
these risk managers  while reporting directly to their respective line of business or function  facilitate communications with the company s risk functions and execute the requirements of the enterprise risk management framework and policies 
enterprise risk management works in partnership with the risk managers to ensure alignment with sound risk management practices as well as industry best practices 
organizationally  the company measures and manages risk according to three main risk categories credit risk  market risk including liquidity risk and operational risk including compliance risk 
the chief credit officer manages the company s credit risk program 
the chief financial officer and treasurer manage the company s market risk program 
the chief operational risk officer manages the company s operational risk program 
these three areas of risk are managed on a consolidated basis under the company s enterprise risk management framework  which also takes into consideration legal and reputational risk factors 
in  suntrust continued to make significant enhancements to its enterprise risk management function 
the model validation and enterprise risk measurement groups continued to provide reasonable assurance that risks inherent in model development and usage are properly identified and managed  and they continued to oversee the calculation of economic capital respectively 
risk identification  assessment and mitigation planning were formally incorporated into the strategic planning process

the erc consists of various senior executives throughout the company and meets on a monthly basis 
the board of directors is wholly responsible for oversight of the company s corporate risk governance process 
the risk committee of the board  which was formed in  assists the board of directors in executing this responsibility 
credit risk management credit risk refers to the potential for economic loss arising from the failure of suntrust clients to meet their contractual agreements on all credit instruments  including on balance sheet exposures from loans and leases  contingent exposures from unfunded commitments  letters of credit  credit derivatives  and counterparty risk under interest rate and foreign exchange derivative products 
as credit risk is an essential component of many of the products and services provided by the company to its clients  the ability to accurately measure and manage credit risk is integral to maintain both the long run profitability of its lines of business and capital adequacy of the enterprise 
suntrust manages and monitors extensions of credit risk through initial underwriting processes and periodic reviews 
suntrust maintains underwriting standards in accordance with credit policies and procedures  and credit risk management conducts independent risk reviews to ensure active compliance with all policies and procedures 
credit risk management periodically reviews its lines of business to monitor asset quality trends and the appropriateness of credit policies 
in particular  total borrower exposure limits are established and concentration risk is monitored 
suntrust has made a major commitment to maintain and enhance comprehensive credit systems in order to be compliant with business requirements and evolving regulatory standards 
as part of a continuous improvement process  suntrust credit risk management evaluates potential enhancements to its risk measurement and management tools  implementing them as appropriate along with amended credit policies and procedures 
borrower counterparty obligor risk and facility risk are evaluated using the company s risk rating methodology  which has been implemented in the lines of business representing the largest total credit exposures 
suntrust uses various risk models in the estimation of expected and unexpected losses 
these models incorporate both internal and external default and loss experience 
to the extent possible  the company collects internal data to ensure the validity  reliability  and accuracy of its risk models used in default and loss estimation 
operational risk management suntrust faces ongoing and emerging risk and regulatory pressure related to the activities that surround the delivery of banking and financial products 
coupled with external influences such as market conditions  fraudulent activities  disasters  security risks  country exposure  and legal risk  the potential for operational and reputational loss has increased significantly 
suntrust believes that effective management of operational risk defined as the risk of loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes  people and systems  or from external events plays a major role in both the level and the stability of the profitability of the institution 
suntrust established an operational risk management function in to provide leadership  expertise  and direction to each line of business and functional area in the development and maintenance of an effective  comprehensive program for the management of operational risk 
these efforts support suntrust s goals to achieve performance targets  prevent loss of resources  and meet regulatory requirements for operational risk management 
operational risk management implements and monitors a framework to organizationally identify  assess  control  quantify  monitor  and report on operational risks companywide 
the goals of this framework are to conduct effective operational risk techniques and strategies  minimize operational losses through enhanced collection and reporting of loss event data  and strengthen suntrust s performance by optimizing operational capital allocation 
market risk management market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates  foreign exchange rates  equity prices  commodity prices and other relevant market rates or prices 
interest rate risk  defined as the exposure of net interest income and economic value of equity eve to adverse movements in interest rates  is suntrust s primary market risk  and mainly arises from the structure of the balance sheet non trading activities 
suntrust is also exposed to market risk in its trading activities  mortgage servicing rights  mortgage warehouse and pipeline  and equity holdings of the coca cola company common stock 
the asset liability management committee meets regularly and is responsible for reviewing the interest rate sensitivity position of the company and establishing policies to monitor and limit exposure to interest rate risk 
the policies established by alco are reviewed and approved by the company s board of directors 
market risk from non trading activities the primary goal of interest rate risk management is to control exposure to interest rate risk  both within policy limits approved by alco and the board and within narrower guidelines established by alco 
these limits and guidelines reflect suntrust s tolerance for interest rate risk over both short term and long term horizons 
the major sources of the company s non trading interest rate risk are timing differences in the maturity and repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities  growth rates of interest bearing assets and liabilities  changes in relationships between rate indices basis risk  changes in the shape of the yield curve  and the potential exercise of explicit or embedded options 
suntrust measures these risks and their impact by identifying and quantifying exposures through use of sophisticated simulation and valuation models  as well as a repricing gap analysis 
one of the primary methods that suntrust uses to quantify and manage interest rate risk is simulation analysis  which is used to model net interest income from assets  liabilities  and derivative positions over a specified time period under various interest rate scenarios and balance sheet structures 
this analysis measures the sensitivity of net interest income over a relatively short time horizon two years 
key assumptions in the simulation analysis and in the valuation analysis discussed below relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads  the changes in product balances and the behavior of loan and deposit customers in different rate environments 
material assumptions include the repricing characteristics and balance fluctuations of indeterminate  or non contractual  deposits 
as the future path of interest rates cannot be known in advance  management uses simulation analysis to project net interest income under various interest rate scenarios including implied forwards and more extreme scenarios 
the analyses may include rapid and gradual ramping of interest rates  rate shocks  spread narrowing and widening  and yield curve twists 
usually  each analysis incorporates what management believes to be the most appropriate assumptions about customer behavior in an interest rate scenario  but in some analyses  assumptions are deliberately changed to test the company s exposure to a specified event or set of events 
specific strategies are also analyzed to determine their impact on net interest income levels and sensitivities 
the following table reflects the estimated sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates 
the sensitivity is measured as a percentage change in net interest income due to gradual changes in interest rates basis points per quarter compared to forecasted net interest income under stable rates for the next twelve months 
estimated changes set forth below are dependent on material assumptions such as those previously discussed 
rate change basis points estimated change in net interest income over months december  december  as indicated  a gradual decrease in interest rates would increase net interest income 
a gradual increase would tend to reduce net interest income  but by an amount that is within the policy limits 
thus  the company s interest rate sensitivity position is slightly liability sensitive 
while simulations of more rapid changes in interest rates indicate more significant fluctuations in net interest income  the company is still within the policy limits 
suntrust also performs valuation analysis  which is used for discerning levels of risk present in the balance sheet and derivative positions that might not be taken into account in the net interest income simulation analysis 
whereas net interest income simulation highlights exposures over a relatively short time horizon  valuation analysis incorporates all cash flows over the estimated remaining life of all balance sheet and derivative positions 
the valuation of the balance sheet  at a point in time  is defined as the discounted present value of asset cash flows and derivative cash flows minus the discounted value of liability cash flows  the net of which is referred to as eve 
the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of the longer term repricing risk and options risk embedded in the balance sheet 
in contrast to the net interest income simulation  which assumes interest rates will change over a period of time ramp  eve uses instantaneous changes in rates shock 
eve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the growth assumptions that are used in the net interest income simulation model 
as with the net interest income simulation model  assumptions about the timing and variability of balance sheet cash flows are critical in the eve analysis 
particularly important are the assumptions driving prepayments and the expected changes in balances and pricing of the indeterminate deposit portfolios 
rate shock basis points estimated change in eve december  december  while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under an extremely adverse scenario  management believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact 
since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments  the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie  the current fiscal year 
further  eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth  changes in product mix  changes in yield curve relationships  and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates 
the net interest income simulation and valuation analyses eve do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage this risk in response to anticipated changes in interest rates 
trading activities most of the company s trading activities are designed to support secondary trading with customers 
product offerings to customers include debt securities  including loans traded in the secondary market  equity securities  derivatives and foreign exchange contracts  and similar financial instruments 
other trading activities include participating in underwritings  and acting as a market maker in certain equity securities 
typically  the company maintains a securities inventory to facilitate customer transactions 
however  in certain businesses  such as derivatives  it is more common to execute customer transactions with simultaneous risk managing transactions with dealers 
also in the normal course of business  the company assumes a degree of market risk in arbitrage  hedging  and other strategies  subject to specified limits 
the company has developed policies and procedures to manage market risk associated with trading  capital markets and foreign exchange activities using a value at risk var approach that combines interest rate risk  equity risk  foreign exchange risk  spread risk and volatility risk 
for trading portfolios  var measures the maximum fair value the company could lose on a trading position  given a specified confidence level and time horizon 
var limits and exposures are monitored daily for each significant trading portfolio 
the company s var calculation measures the potential losses in fair value using a confidence level 
this equates to standard deviations from the mean under a normal distribution 
this means that  on average  daily profits and losses are expected to exceed var one out of every overnight trading days 
the var methodology includes holding periods for each position based upon an assessment of relative trading market liquidity 
for the foreign exchange  equities  structured trades and derivatives desks  the company estimates var by applying the monte carlo simulation platform as designed by riskmetrics  and for the estimate of the fixed income var  the company uses bloomberg analytics 
for equity derivatives  the imagine system is used for var 
the company uses an internally developed methodology to estimate var for the collateralized debt obligations and loan trading desks 
the estimated average combined undiversified var undiversified var represents a simple summation of the var calculated across each desk was million for and million for trading assets net of trading liabilities averaged billion for and billion for the estimated combined period end undiversified var was million at december  and million at december  trading assets net of trading liabilities were billion at december  and billion at december  liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk of being unable to meet obligations as they come due at a reasonable funding cost 
suntrust manages this risk by structuring its balance sheet prudently and by maintaining borrowing resources to fund potential cash needs 
the company assesses liquidity needs in the form of increases in assets  maturing obligations  or deposit withdrawals  considering both operations in the normal course of business and in times of unusual events 
in addition  the company considers the off balance sheet arrangements and commitments it has entered into  which could also affect the company s liquidity position 
the alco of the company measures this risk  sets policies  and reviews adherence to those policies 
the company s sources of funds include a large  stable deposit base  secured advances from the federal home loan bank fhlb and access to the capital markets 
the company structures its balance sheet so that illiquid assets  such as loans  are funded through customer deposits  long term debt  other liabilities and capital 
customer based core deposits  the company s largest and most cost effective source of funding  accounted for of the funding base on average for compared to for the decrease in this ratio was due primarily to loan growth funded with wholesale borrowings 
average customer based core deposits increased billion  or  compared to the growth was exclusively in higher cost certificates of deposit 
increases in rates  improved economic activity and confidence in the financial markets may lead to disintermediation of deposits  which may need to be replaced with higher cost borrowings in the future 
total wholesale funding  including net short term unsecured borrowings  net secured wholesale borrowings and long term debt  totaled billion at december  compared to billion at december  the decrease reflects the maturities of long term debt funding the balance sheet throughout the year 
net short term unsecured borrowings  including wholesale domestic and foreign deposits and fed funds  totaled billion at december  compared to billion at december  growth in the loan portfolio exceeded the growth in retail deposits  and the shortfall has been funded using short term unsecured borrowings 
outstanding loans were billion and billion at december  and december   respectively 
the company maintains access to a diversified base of wholesale funding sources 
these non committed sources include fed funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  negotiable certificates of deposit  offshore deposits  fhlb advances  global bank note issuance and commercial paper issuance 
as of december   suntrust bank had billion remaining under its global bank note program 
the global bank note program was established to expand funding and capital sources to include both domestic and international investors 
in december  suntrust issued billion of global debt in an effort to diversify its investor base 
the floating rate debt was issued at month euribor basis points and has a maturity of five years 
in conjunction with the debt issuance  suntrust entered into a billion cross currency swap transaction in order to hedge currency fluctuation 
liquidity is also available through unpledged securities in the investment portfolio and capacity to securitize loans  including single family mortgage loans 
the company s credit ratings are important to its access to unsecured wholesale borrowings 
significant changes in these ratings could change the cost and availability of these sources 
the company manages reliance on short term unsecured borrowings as well as total wholesale funding through policies established and reviewed by alco 
the company has a contingency funding plan that stresses the liquidity needs that may arise from certain events such as agency rating downgrades  rapid loan growth  or significant deposit runoff 
the plan also provides for continual monitoring of net borrowed funds dependence and available sources of liquidity 
management believes the company has the funding capacity to meet the liquidity needs arising from potential events 
liquidity for suntrust banks  inc parent company only parent company is measured comparing sources of liquidity in unpledged securities and short term investments relative to its short term debt 
as of december   the parent company had billion in such sources compared to short term debt of billion 
the georgia department of banking and finance limits dividends to of prior year s net income  without its prior approval 
suntrust bank the bank has exceeded this limitation since and has received the necessary approvals for dividends beyond this amount 
additionally  the bank is limited under federal regulations based on prior two years net retained earnings plus the current year s net retained earnings 
during  the subsidiary bank can pay billion  plus the current year s earnings without prior approval from the appropriate regulatory agency 
as detailed in table  the company had billion in unused lines of credit at december  that were not recorded on the company s balance sheet 
commitments to extend credit are arrangements to lend to a customer who has complied with predetermined contractual obligations 
the company also had billion in letters of credit as of december   most of which are standby letters of credit that provide that suntrust bank fund if certain future events occur 
of this  approximately billion support variable rate demand obligations vrdos remarketed by suntrust and other agents 
vrdos are municipal securities which are remarketed by the agent on a regular basis  usually weekly 
in the event that the securities are unable to be remarketed  suntrust bank would fund under the letters of credit 
certain provisions of long term debt agreements and the lines of credit prevent the company from creating liens on  disposing of  or issuing except to related parties voting stock of subsidiaries 
further  there are restrictions on mergers  consolidations  certain leases  sales or transfers of assets  and minimum shareholders equity ratios 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all covenants and provisions of these debt agreements

other market risk other sources of market risk include the risk associated with holding residential mortgage loans prior to selling them into the secondary mortgage market  commitments to customers to make mortgage loans that will be sold to the secondary mortgage market  and the company s investment in msrs 
the company manages the risks associated with the residential mortgage loans classified as held for sale the warehouse and its interest rate lock commitments irlcs on residential loans intended for sale 
the warehouse and irlcs consist primarily of fixed and adjustable rate single family residential real estate loans 
the risk associated with the warehouse and irlcs is the potential change in interest rates between the time the customer locks in the rate on the anticipated loan and the time the loan is sold on the secondary mortgage market  which is typically days 
the company manages interest rate risk predominately with forward sale agreements  where the changes in value of the forward sale agreements substantially offset the changes in value of the warehouse and the irlcs 
interest rate risk on the warehouse is managed via forward sale agreements in a designated fair value hedging relationship  under sfas no 
irlcs on residential mortgage loans intended for sale are classified as free standing derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
and are not designated as sfas no 
hedge accounting relationships 
the value of the msrs asset is primarily dependent upon the assumed prepayment speed of the mortgage servicing portfolio 
msrs are the discounted present value of future net cash flows that are expected to be received from the mortgage servicing portfolio 
future expected net cash flows from servicing a loan in the mortgage servicing portfolio would not be realized if the loan pays off earlier than anticipated 
accordingly  prepayment risk subjects the msrs to impairment risk 
the company does not specifically hedge the msrs asset for the potential impairment risk  however  it does employ a balanced business strategy using the natural counter cyclicality of servicing and production to mitigate impairment risk 
the fair value determination  key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of the msrs as of december  and december  is discussed in greater detail in note  securitization activity mortgage servicing rights to the consolidated financial statements

the net interest margin is calculated by dividing annualized net interest income fte by average total earning assets

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in detail in note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements and are integral to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
management has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies and they have a significant impact on the financial statements 
a variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income  recognizing an expense  recovering an asset  or reducing a liability 
the company s accounting and reporting policies are in accordance with us gaap  and they conform to general practices within the applicable industries 
the company has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
in addition  the policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner 
the following is a description of the company s current accounting policies that are considered to involve significant management judgment 
allowance for loan and lease losses the allowance for loan and lease losses represents the company s estimate of probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the alll is increased by the provision for loan losses and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the alll is determined based on management s assessment of reviews and evaluations of larger loans that meet the company s definition of impairment and the size and current risk characteristics of pools of homogeneous loans ie  loans having similar characteristics within the portfolio 
impaired loans  except for smaller balance homogeneous loans  include loans classified as nonaccrual where it is probable that suntrust will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
when a loan is deemed impaired  the amount of specific allowance required is measured by a careful analysis of the most probable source of repayment  including the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows  the fair value of the underlying collateral less costs of disposition  or the loan s estimated market value 
in these measurements  management uses assumptions and methodologies that are relevant to estimating the level of impaired and unrealized losses in the portfolio 
to the extent that the data supporting such assumptions has limitations  management s judgment and experience play a key role in enhancing the alll estimates 
general allowances are established for loans and leases grouped into pools that have similar characteristics  including smaller balance homogeneous loans 
the alll committee estimates probable losses by evaluating several factors historical loss experience  current internal risk ratings based on the company s internal risk rating system  internal portfolio trends such as increasing or decreasing levels of delinquencies  concentrations  and external influences such as changes in economic or industry conditions 
the company s financial results are impacted by the changes and absolute level of the alll 
this process involves management s analysis of complex internal and external variables  and it requires that management exercise judgment to estimate an appropriate alll 
as a result of the uncertainty associated with this subjectivity  the company cannot assure the precision of the amount reserved  should it experience sizeable loan or lease losses in any particular period 
for example  changes in the financial condition of individual borrowers  economic conditions  historical loss experience  or the condition of various markets in which collateral may be sold could require the company to significantly decrease or increase the level of the alll and the associated provision for loan losses 
such an adjustment could materially affect net income 
for additional discussion of the allowance for loan and lease losses see the allowance for loan and lease losses and provision for loan losses sections beginning on page estimates of fair value fair value is defined as the amount at which an asset or liability could be sold in a transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced or liquidation sale  in a normal business transaction 
the estimation of fair value is significant to a number of suntrust s assets and liabilities  including loans held for sale  financial instruments  msrs  other real estate owned  other repossessed assets  goodwill  retirement and postretirement benefit obligations  as well as assets and liabilities associated with derivative financial instruments 
these are all recorded at either fair value or at the lower of cost or fair value 
fair value is based on market prices for the same instrument or for similar instruments adjusted for any differences in terms 
if market prices are not available  then fair value is estimated using modeling techniques such as discounted cash flow analyses 
in instances where required by us gaap  the company uses discount rates in its determination of the fair value of certain assets and liabilities such as retirement and other postretirement benefit obligations and msrs 
discount rates used are those considered to be commensurate with the risks involved 
a change in these discount rates could increase or decrease the values of those assets and liabilities 
the company provides disclosure of the key economic assumptions used to measure msrs and a sensitivity analysis to adverse changes to these assumptions in note  securitization activity mortgage servicing rights  to the consolidated financial statements 
the fair values of msrs are based on discounted cash flow analyses 
a detailed discussion of key variables  including the discount rate  used in the determination of retirement and other postretirement obligations is in the pension accounting section 
fair values for investment securities and most derivative financial instruments are based on independent  third party market prices 
if market prices are not available  fair values are based on the market prices of similar instruments 
the fair values of loans held for sale are based on observable current market prices 
the fair values of oreo and other repossessed assets are typically determined based on appraisals by third parties  less estimated selling costs 
estimates of fair value are also required in performing an impairment analysis of goodwill 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an additional analysis must be performed to determine the amount  if any  by which goodwill is impaired 
in determining the fair value of suntrust s reporting units  management uses discounted cash flow models which require assumptions about growth rates of the reporting units and the cost of equity 
pension accounting several variables affect the annual pension cost and the annual variability of cost for the suntrust retirement programs 
the main variables are size and characteristics of the employee population  discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  recognition of actual asset returns and other actuarial assumptions 
below is a brief description of these variables and the effect they have on suntrust s pension costs 
size and characteristics of the employee population pension cost is directly related to the number of employees covered by the plans  and other factors including salary  age  and years of employment 
the number of employees eligible for pension benefits has increased over prior years  especially with the addition of ncf employees at the end of discount rate the discount rate is used to determine the present value of future benefit obligations 
the discount rate for each plan is determined by matching the expected cash flows of each plan to a yield curve based on long term  high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date  december this assumption is updated every year for each plan 
the discount rate for each plan is reset annually on the measurement date to reflect current market conditions 
if the company were to assume a increase decrease in the discount rate for all retirement and other postretirement plans  and keep all other assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and market projection of the target asset allocation set forth in the investment policy for the suntrust and ncf retirement plans  the pre tax expected rate of return on plan assets was and in and  respectively 
this expected rate of return is not expected to change significantly each year 
annual differences  if any  between expected and actual returns are included in the unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss amount 
the company generally amortizes any unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss in excess of a corridor  as defined in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
in net periodic pension expense over the average future service of active employees  which is approximately eight years 
see note  employee benefit plans  to the consolidated financial statements for details on changes in the pension benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets 
if the company were to assume a increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return for the retirement and other postretirement plans  holding all other actuarial assumptions constant  the benefit cost would decrease increase by approximately million 
recognition of actual asset returns sfas no 
allows for the use of an asset value that smoothes investment gains and losses over a period up to five years 
however  suntrust has elected to use a preferable method in determining pension expense 
this method uses the actual market value of the plan assets  and therefore  immediately recognizes prior gains and losses 
therefore  suntrust will have more variability in the annual pension cost  as the asset values will be more volatile than companies who elected to smooth their investment experience 
other actuarial assumptions to estimate the projected benefit obligation  actuarial assumptions are required about factors such as mortality rate  turnover rate  retirement rate  disability rate and the rate of compensation increases 
these factors don t tend to change significantly over time  so the range of assumptions  and their impact on pension cost  is generally limited 
suntrust periodically reviews the assumptions used based on historical and expected future experience 
due to the adoption of sfas no 
 to estimate the projected benefit obligation as of december   the company projected forward the benefit obligations from january  to december   adjusting for benefit payments  expected growth in the benefit obligations  changes in key assumptions and plan provisions  and any significant changes in the plan demographics that occurred during the year  including where appropriate subsidized early retirements  salary changes different from expectations  entrance of new participants  changes in per capita claims cost  medicare part d subsidy  and retiree contributions 
income taxes the company is subject to the income tax laws of the various jurisdictions where it conducts business and estimates income tax expense based on amounts expected to be owed to these various tax jurisdictions 
on a quarterly basis  management evaluates the reasonableness of the company s effective tax rate based upon its current estimate of net income  tax credits  and the applicable statutory tax rates expected for the full year 
the estimated income tax expense is reported in the consolidated statements of income 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing jurisdictions either currently or in the future and is reported in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
suntrust assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes  regulations  judicial precedent and other pertinent information and maintains tax accruals consistent with its evaluation 
changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates  interpretations of tax laws  the status of examinations by the taxing authorities  and newly enacted statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits of tax positions 
these changes  when they occur  impact accrued taxes and can materially affect the company s operating results
