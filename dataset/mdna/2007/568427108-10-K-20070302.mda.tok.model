item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is based upon and should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and financial statements and supplementary data 
see also forward looking statements on page overview marine products  through our wholly owned subsidiaries chaparral and robalo  is a leading manufacturer of recreational fiberglass powerboats 
our sales and profits are generated by selling the products that we manufacture to a network of independent dealers who in turn sell the products to retail customers 
these dealers are located throughout the continental united states and in several international markets 
most of these dealers finance their inventory through third party floorplan lenders  who pay marine products upon delivery of the products to the dealers 
we manage our company by focusing on the execution of the following business and financial strategies manufacturing high quality  stylish  and innovative powerboats for our dealers and retail customers  providing our independent dealer network appropriate incentives  training  and other support to enhance their success and their customers satisfaction  thereby facilitating their continued relationship with us  managing our production and dealer order backlog to maximize profitability and reduce risk in the event of a downturn in sales of our products  maintaining a flexible  variable cost structure which can be reduced quickly when deemed appropriate  focusing on the competitive nature of the boating business and designing our products and strategies in order to grow and maintain profitable market share  maximizing shareholder return by optimizing the balance of cash invested in the company s productive assets  the payment of dividends to shareholders  and the repurchase of its common stock on the open market  aligning the interests of our management and shareholders 
in implementing these strategies and attempting to optimize our financial returns  management closely monitors dealer orders and inventories  the production mix of its various models  and indications of near term demand such as consumer confidence  interest rates  dealer orders placed at our annual dealer conferences  and retail attendance and orders at annual winter boat show exhibitions 
we also consider trends related to certain key financial and other data  including our market share  unit sales of our products  average selling price per boat  and gross profit margins  among others  as indicators of the success of our strategies 
marine products financial results are affected by consumer confidence because pleasure boating is a discretionary expenditure  interest rates because many retail customers finance the purchase of their boats  and other socioeconomic and environmental factors such as availability of leisure time  consumer preferences  demographics and the weather 
during  the industry continued the trend of lower wholesale and retail sales that began in the fourth quarter of the hurricanes in the gulf of mexico in the third quarter of damaged geographical areas that are popular for boating and the boating related infrastructure in those areas 
the severe hurricanes impacted consumer sentiment for because of the expectation that the hurricane season would be as active as the hurricane season in although the hurricane season was actually very mild by historical standards  this was not known until the end of the retail boating season 
high fuel prices during the beginning of also contributed to negative consumer sentiment  because fluctuation in fuel prices created uncertainty which caused consumers to be concerned about the potential costs of operating a pleasure boat 
these industry conditions were reflected in our production levels  which were lower than in in order to maintain appropriate dealer inventories and backlog 
we monitor our market share in the to foot sterndrive category as one indicator of the success of our strategies and the market s acceptance of our products 
for the nine months ended september  latest data available to us  chaparral s market share in the to foot sterndrive category was percent  a decline from our market share in the same category for the twelve months ended december  of percent 
this decline was concentrated in the smaller to foot size boats in our market 
we believe this was the result of two factors the execution of our stated strategy of selling larger  more profitable boats  and the strategy of certain of our competitors  who have built and sold a large number of entry level smaller boats which are constructed in offshore manufacturing plants with lower cost labor 
although we will continue to monitor our market share and believe it to be important  we also believe that maximizing profitability takes precedence over growing our market share 
outlook management believes that realizing growth in net sales and profits in will be a challenge 
this belief is based on lower attendance and sales during the first part of the winter boat show season compared to the same period in in addition  management believes that consumers are concerned about fluctuating fuel prices and a possible slowing economy 
boat show attendance has historically been positively correlated with retail boat sales later in the selling season because consumers attend shows due to their interest in recreational boating and make initial purchasing decisions at a boat show exhibition 
however  there can be no assurance that this relationship will continue in or subsequent years 
pleasure boating is a discretionary consumer activity  and can be negatively impacted by many factors  therefore  an increase in interest rates  the expectation of high fuel costs  or a decline in consumer confidence could have a serious and immediate negative impact on net sales and profits 
over the past several years  marine products as well as other manufacturers have been improving their customer service capabilities  marketing strategies and sales promotions in order to attract more consumers to recreational boating as well as improve consumers boating experiences 
in addition  the recreational boating industry has started a promotional program which involves advertising and consumer targeting efforts  as well as other activities designed to increase the potential consumer market for pleasure boats 
many manufacturers  including marine products  are participating in this program 
management believes that these efforts will benefit the industry and marine products  but could result in increased advertising and other selling  general and administrative expenses during our ability to maintain or improve our net sales and profits in will depend on a number of factors  including interest rates  fuel costs  consumer confidence  the continued acceptance of our products in the recreational boating market  our ability to compete in the competitive pleasure boating industry  and the costs of certain of our raw materials 
results of operations s in thousands total number of boats sold average gross selling price per boat net sales percentage of gross profit to net sales percentage of selling  general and administrative expense to net sales operating income warranty expense year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
marine products net sales decreased by million or percent in compared to the decrease was due to a percent decrease in the number of boats sold  partially offset by an increase in the average gross selling price per boat and an increase in parts and accessories sales 
a percent increase in average gross selling price per boat was due to higher sales of larger boats  in addition to overall price increases that were implemented for the model year  which began in the third quarter  and to a lesser extent  a price increase of approximately one percent that took effect in january to offset the higher cost of materials 
cost of goods sold

the increase in average gross selling price per boat was due to higher sales of larger boats  in addition to overall price increases that were implemented for the model year  which began in july  as well as a price increase of approximately one percent that took effect in january to offset the higher cost of materials 
the increase in parts and accessories sales was a result of high demand for accessories ordered on base model boats and the higher numbers of boats sold in prior years that are still in operation and require routine maintenance and repair 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold increased percent in compared to  slightly higher than the increase in net sales 
as a percentage of net sales  cost of goods sold increased slightly in compared to  primarily due to increases in the cost of certain materials and components

warranty expense increased in due to increased sales and was percent of net sales in and percent of net sales in the expenses decreased as a percentage of sales due to quality improvement initiatives coupled with a focus on claims management processes 
interest income 
interest income was million in compared to million in marine products generates interest income from investment of its available cash primarily in overnight and marketable securities 
the increase in interest income resulted primarily from higher percentage yields  consistent with recent increases in short term interest rates  partially offset by lower investable cash balances 
income tax provision 
the lower effective tax rate in of percent compared to percent in resulted from the benefit of the new manufacturing deduction created by the american jobs creation act of and a contingency adjustment 
the decrease was also attributable to certain reductions in the tax provision resulting from the effect of these strategies reflected on prior year returns filed during and a tax benefit from a reduction in certain state tax liabilities 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash flows the company s cash and cash equivalents were million at december   million at december  and million at december  the following table sets forth the historical cash flows for the twelve months ended december in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities cash provided by operating activities increased by million in compared to as a result of an increase in other accrued expenses together with decreases in accounts receivable and income taxes receivable  all due to timing differences  offset by lower operating income

capital expenditures in included higher costs than in to expand manufacturing facilities 
cash used for financing activities increased million in compared to primarily due to an increase of million in cash amounts used to purchase the company s common stock in the open market  and an increase from to in quarterly dividends declared per common share 
cash requirements management expects that capital expenditures during will be approximately million  and are expected to include investment towards enhancements to certain manufacturing plants and the addition of a parts warehouse 
we expect that additional contributions to the defined benefit pension plan of approximately million will be required in to achieve the company s funding objective 
at the january  board of directors meeting  the board approved an increase in the cash dividend per common share from to 
based on the shares outstanding on december   the aggregate annual dividends to be paid at this dividend rate would be approximately million 
the company expects to continue to pay cash dividends to common stockholders  subject to the earnings and financial condition of the company and other relevant factors 
the company has an agreement with two employees  which provides for a monthly payment to each of the employees equal to percent of profits defined as pretax income before goodwill amortization and certain allocated corporate expenses 
the company has purchased a total of  shares in the open market and as of december  can purchase  additional shares under its repurchase program 
the company believes that the liquidity provided by its existing cash and cash equivalents  overall capitalization and cash expected to be generated from operations will provide sufficient capital to meet its requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligation operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total operating leases represent agreements for various office equipment 
as part of the normal course of business the company enters into purchase commitments to manage its various operating needs 
however  the company does not have any obligations that are non cancelable or subject to a penalty if canceled 
includes expected cash payments for long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet where the timing of the payment is known 
these amounts include primarily known pension plan funding obligations 
these amounts exclude pension obligations with uncertain funding requirements and deferred compensation liabilities 
off balance sheet arrangements to assist dealers in obtaining financing for the purchase of its boats for inventory  the company has entered into agreements with various dealers and selected third party lenders to guarantee varying amounts of qualifying dealers debt obligations 
the company s obligation under these guarantees may become effective in the case of default by one or more dealers 
the agreements provide for the lender to return all repossessed boats in like new condition to the company  in exchange for the company s assumption of specified percentages of the dealers unpaid debt obligation on those boats 
the maximum contractual obligation and the amount outstanding under these agreements  which expire in  was million as of december  the company has recorded the estimated fair value of this guarantee  at december   this amount is immaterial and did not change from the prior year 
during the fourth quarter of  a dealer defaulted on its debt obligation to a floor plan lender related to approximately million of boat inventory 
during  the company assisted the lender in coordinating the redistribution of these boats among existing and replacement dealers 
the ultimate cost to the company for these transactions and the impact on sales was not material 
related party transactions in conjunction with its spin off from rpc in  the company and rpc entered into various agreements that define the companies relationship after the spin off 
the transition support services agreement provides for rpc to provide certain services  including financial reporting and income tax administration  acquisition assistance  etc  to marine products until the agreement is terminated by either party 
marine products reimbursed rpc for its estimated allocable share of administrative costs incurred for services rendered on behalf of marine products totaling  in   in and  in the company s liability to rpc for these services as of december  and was approximately  and  the company s directors are also directors of rpc and all of the executive officers with the exception of one director are employees of both the company and rpc

the general terms provide for the indemnification for any tax detriment incurred by one party caused by the other party s action 
in accordance with the agreement  rpc transferred approximately  in to the company related to tax settlements 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating accounting estimates 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  trends in the industry  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
the company believes that  of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
sales recognition the company sells its boats through its network of independent dealers 
sales orders used to plan production are firm indications of interest from dealers and are cancelable at any time  although very few orders are cancelled after they have been placed 
the company recognizes sales when all the following conditions are met a fully executed sales agreement exists  the price of the boat is established  the dealer takes delivery of the boat  and collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured 
sales incentives and discounts the company records incentives as a reduction of sales 
using historical trends  adjusted for current changes  the company estimates the amount of incentives that will be paid in the future on boats sold and accrues an estimated liability 
the company offers various incentives that promote sales to dealers  and to a lesser extent  retail customers 
these incentives are designed to encourage timely replenishment of dealer inventories after peak selling seasons  stabilize manufacturing volumes throughout the year  and improve production model mix 
the dealer incentive programs are a combination of annual volume commitment discounts  and additional discounts at time of invoice for those dealers who do not finance their inventory through specified floor plan financing agreements 
the annual dealer volume discounts are based on july through june model year purchases 
in addition  the company offers at various times other time specific or model specific incentives 
the retail incentive programs have historically been used during off peak selling seasons in addition to the winter boat exhibition shows 
the factors that complicate the calculation of the cost of these incentives are the ability to forecast sales of the company and individual dealers  the volume and timing of inventory financed by specific dealers  identification of which boats have been sold subject to an incentive  and the estimated lag time between sales and payment of incentives 
settlement of the incentives generally occurs from three to twelve months after the sale 
the company regularly analyzes the historical incentive trends and makes adjustments to recorded liabilities for changes in trends and terms of incentive programs 
total incentives as a percentage of gross sales were percent in  percent in and percent in a percentage point change in incentives as a percentage of gross sales during would have increased or decreased net sales  gross margin and operating income by approximately million 
warranty costs the company records as part of selling  general and administrative expense an experience based estimate of the future warranty costs to be incurred when sales are recognized 
the company evaluates its warranty obligation on a model year basis 
the company provides warranties against manufacturing defects for various components of the boats  primarily the fiberglass deck and hull  with warranty periods extending up to years 
warranty costs  if any  on other components of the boats are generally absorbed by the original component manufacturer 
warranty costs can vary depending upon the size and number of components in the boats sold  the pre sale warranty claims  and the desired level of customer service 
while we focus on high quality manufacturing programs and processes  including actively monitoring the quality of our component suppliers and managing the dealer and customer service warranty experience and reimbursements  our estimated warranty obligation is based upon the warranty terms and our enforcement of those terms over time  defects  repair costs  and the volume and mix of boat sales 
the estimate of warranty costs is regularly analyzed and is adjusted based on several factors including the actual claims that occur 
warranty expense as a percentage of net sales was percent in  percent for and percent in warranty expense as a percentage of net sales has increased in compared to because of adjustments based on reviews of recent claims experience 
these adjustments reflect changes in estimated costs per claim due primarily to higher labor rates and parts costs 
a percentage point increase in the estimated warranty expense as a percentage of net sales during would have increased selling  general and administrative expenses and reduced operating income by approximately million 
income taxes the effective income tax rates were percent in  percent in  and percent in our effective tax rates vary due to changes in estimates of our future taxable income  fluctuations in the tax jurisdictions in which our earnings and deductions are realized  and favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities related to proposed or probable assessments 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly or annual basis 
we establish a valuation allowance against the carrying value of deferred tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized through future taxable income 
such amounts are charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we have considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are recorded when identified  which is generally in the third quarter of the subsequent year for us federal and state provisions 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the year the differences are expected to reverse 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal and state tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate for the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  to permit fair value re measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the company will adopt sfas in fiscal year the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
 that provides guidance on accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas  separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be initially measured at fair value  if practicable 
subsequent to initial recognition  the company may use either the amortization method or the fair value measurement method to account for servicing assets and servicing liabilities within the scope of this statement 
the company will adopt sfas in fiscal year the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of applying the provisions of fin in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  that provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
under sfas  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop the assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data 
in addition  sfas requires that fair value measurements be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
this standard will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal periods beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of applying the various provisions of sfas in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this statement improves financial reporting by requiring an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit pension plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
this statement requires the company to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective as of the fiscal year ending after december  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company has adopted the recognition provisions of sfas as of december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for details 
the company currently measures the plan assets and benefit obligations as of its fiscal year end and therefore adoption of the measurement provisions will not have a significant impact on its consolidated results of operation and financial condition 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
the guidance in sab must be applied to annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the financial accounting standards board ratified a consensus opinion reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf issue  accounting for purchases of life insurance determining the amount that could be realized in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
the guidance in eitf requires policyholders to consider other amounts included in the contractual terms of an insurance policy  in addition to cash surrender value  for purposes of determining the amount that could be realized under the terms of the insurance contract 
if it is probable that contractual terms would limit the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract  those contractual limitations should be considered when determining the realizable amounts 
the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract should be determined on an individual policy or certificate level and should include any amount realized on the assumed surrender of the last individual policy or certificate in a group policy 
the consensus in eitf issue is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company intends to adopt eitf issue effective january   and does not believe that the adoption will have a significant effect on its financial statements

management s report on internal control over financial reporting to the stockholders of marine products corporation the management of marine products corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for the company 
marine products corporation maintains a system of internal accounting controls designed to provide reasonable assurance  at a reasonable cost  that assets are safeguarded against loss or unauthorized use and that the financial records are adequate and can be relied upon to produce financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america

also  no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and any instances of fraud  if any  within the company will be detected 
further  the design of a controls system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs 
the company intends to continually improve and refine its internal controls
