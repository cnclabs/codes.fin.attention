our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k  particularly in item a 
under the heading risk factors 
overview general 
we are a fabless semiconductor company that designs  develops  and markets proprietary  analog intensive  mixed signal integrated circuits  or ics  for a variety of digital multimedia products in the consumer electronics markets  including digital media players  printers  and digital televisions 
we made our first commercial shipments of portable multimedia systems on a chip  or socs  for the portable multimedia player market in during  we made our first commercial shipments of audio codecs into the consumer electronics market for products such as dvd players and set top boxes 
we made our first commercial shipments of multi function peripheral ics in the third quarter of as a result of our acquisition of oasis semiconductor  inc we made our first commercial shipments of television audio processors during the third quarter of we plan to continue to diversify our product offerings by introducing new versions of existing products with additional functionality  and by introducing ics for markets we do not currently serve  thereby expanding our total available market opportunity 
a further description of our products may be found in part i  item i of this report under the heading business 
net loss  cost reductions and refocus 
we incurred a net loss of million for the year ended december   and we will likely incur net losses in the future 
we have faced a number of challenges that have affected our operating results during the past year and a half  including extreme competition in the portable multimedia soc market  continuing erosion of average selling prices of our portable multimedia socs  delays in delivering new product features to existing and new customers  and price volatility and shortages of other components used to build our customers devices 
although we have taken and plan to take additional steps to address these challenges and to improve our results of operations  we cannot provide assurance that we will return to profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
effective january   ronald p 
edgerton resigned from his positions as our president  chief executive officer  chairman and as a member of our board of directors 
mr 
edgerton held these positions since march phillip e 
pompa  formerly our senior vice president of portable systems group  has been appointed as our president and chief executive officer 
in january  we announced that we are refocusing our business on our three core markets portable multimedia players  printers  and  digital televisions 
we also announced that we are immediately taking steps to reduce our operating costs through cost control measures and reductions in force 
as we implement these cost reductions  we will remain focused on retaining our key technical talent and preserving the integrity of our core product offerings 
as part of this plan  we have terminated future efforts with respect to the digital video camera  usb and infrared peripheral  and certain consumer audio codec markets 
we expect these cost cutting measures to be completed in the third quarter of these changes have placed  and any future organizational changes will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  personnel  systems and resources 
if we are unable to manage our organizational changes effectively  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  develop new products  enhance our technological capabilities  satisfy customer requirements  execute on our business plan or respond to competitive pressures 
new product introduction and acceptance 
in october of  we introduced our stmp xx family of portable multimedia socs  our newest soc for flash based and hard disk based digital multimedia players 
our historical revenue growth has been primarily from sales of our stmp xx family of portable multimedia socs  which accounted for of our revenue in the year ended december  we introduced the stmp xx family of portable multimedia socs in the fourth quarter of and  despite continued sales of the stmp xx socs  as those products have matured  their average selling prices have declined  which is typical for the semiconductor industry 
our future success depends on our ability to market and sell our existing products  and to develop other new products  including new families of portable multimedia socs  in a timely and cost effective manner 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to develop and introduce  or that potential customers will be able to implement  new or enhanced products in a timely and cost effective manner or that our new products will generate significant revenues 
competition  average selling prices 
we face competition from a relatively large number of competitors in each of our target markets 
the consumer electronics market  which is a principal end market for our ics  has historically been subject to intense price competition 
as a result of this competition and erosion of average selling prices  we continue to experience substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results 
in the past  we have reduced the average selling price of our products in anticipation of or in response to competitive pricing pressures and new product introductions by us or our competitors 
we believe that as our product lines continue to mature and competitive markets evolve  we are likely to experience further decline in the average selling prices of our products  although we cannot predict the timing and amount of such future changes with any certainty 
if we are unable to offset any such reductions in our average selling prices by timely introducing new products and product enhancements  increasing our sales volumes and reducing our costs  our gross profits and revenues will suffer 

table of contents 
index to financial statements historical growth  recent pressures 
our business has grown rapidly since our inception as a result of acquisitions  the opening of international locations and through hiring  both domestically and internationally 
the historical expansion of our business and operations  which includes the acquisitions of oasis and protocom  has placed  and any future expansion will continue to place  a significant strain on our management  personnel  systems and resources  and has significantly increased our operating expenses 
during the third and fourth quarter of  we eliminated approximately positions in cupertino  california  austin  texas and waltham  massachusetts 
in january  we announced that we are immediately taking steps to reduce our operating costs through cost control measures and reductions in force 
if we are unable to manage these changes effectively  we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities  develop new products  enhance our technological capabilities  satisfy customer requirements  execute on our business plan  regain profitability or respond to competitive pressures 
accordingly  you should not rely on the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods as an indication of our future operating performance 
sales channels 
as a fabless semiconductor company  our business model is less capital intensive because we rely on third parties to manufacture  assemble  and test our ics 
we also utilize distributors to sell our products 
our sales through distributors result in lower gross margins 
however  this decrease in gross margins from sales through distributors is partially offset by lower selling expenses than are associated with direct sales to end customers 
in recent periods  we have begun engaging in more direct sales to customers  which generally results in higher gross margins than indirect sales  but also involves increased selling expenses 
as our sales practices continue to evolve towards increased direct sales to end customers  there will be continued fluctuations in our gross margins and operating margins 
significant customers 
a few customers account for a substantial portion of our sales 
the following table sets forth our customers that represented or more of our revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  creative technology gmi technology asustek computer inc holystone enterprise less than creative technology held more than of our outstanding stock during the periods indicated  until october creative also had a representative on our board of directors until his resignation on june  we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our sales for the foreseeable future 
the identities of our largest customers and their respective contributions to our net revenues have varied and will likely continue to vary from period to period 
overseas revenues 
the percentage of our revenues from customers located outside the united states was   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
most of the products that use our ics are manufactured outside of the united states 
as a result  we believe that a substantial majority of our revenues will continue to come from customers located outside of the united states 
all of our revenues to date have been denominated in united states dollars 
the percentages of our revenues by country are set forth in the following table year ended december  taiwan china hong kong singapore us other total sales cycles 
the length of our sales cycle varies depending on the end application for our products  but our sales cycles are generally lengthy 
the cycle can be as short as several months for some portable socs and as long as months for our multi function printer system controller solutions 
volume production of products that use our ics can take an additional three to six months to be achieved  if at all 
the lengthy sales cycles of our products make forecasting the volume and timing of orders difficult 
in addition  the delays inherent in lengthy sales cycles increase the risk that customers may seek to cancel or modify their orders 
our sales are made by purchase orders  but because industry practice allows customers to reschedule or cancel orders on relatively short 
table of contents 
index to financial statements notice  and order lead times can vary period to period  backlog is not a good indicator of our future sales 
cancellations of customer orders or changes in product specifications could result in the loss of anticipated sales without allowing us sufficient time to reduce our inventory and operating expenses  adversely affecting our results of operations 
seasonality 
because many of our ics are designed for use in consumer electronic products  such as portable multimedia players  multi function printers  and digital televisions  we expect our business to be subject to seasonality  with increased revenues in the third and fourth quarters of each year  when customers place orders to meet year end holiday demand  and lower revenues in the first and second quarters of each year 
however  our historic revenue volatility and recent revenue declines make it difficult for us to assess the impact of seasonal factors on our business 
sale of the pc audio product line 
during the third quarter of  we completed the sale of our pc audio codec product line to integrated device technology inc idt for total consideration of million 
the consideration consisted of million in cash  million in accounts receivable which we retained  and million in accounts payable assumed by idt 
million of the purchase price was deposited into an escrow account upon closing for purposes of settling indemnification claims for the one year period following the closing 
the cash consideration was offset by million in closing costs 
pursuant to the terms of the sale  approximately employees and associated contractors became employees of idt 
in connection with the sale  we entered into several ancillary agreements with idt  including a transition services agreement designed to ensure a smooth transition of the pc audio codec product line to idt  and an intellectual property license agreement pursuant to which idt received rights to certain intellectual property being retained by us related to the pc audio codec product line 
as part of the sale  we agreed not to engage in transactions with the pc audio codec product line for a period of two years following the closing 
statement of operations overview the following describes certain line items in our consolidated statement of operations revenues 
revenues consist primarily of sales of our ics  net of sales discounts or incentives 
we recognize revenues on direct sales at the time of shipment to our customers or later if required by shipping terms 
we defer revenues on sales through distributors which have rights of return or price protection until products are resold by such distributors to their customers 
we also defer revenue from nonrecurring engineering fees nre until the obligations under the nre agreements have been met 
the main factors that impact our revenues are unit volumes shipped and average selling prices 
overall  we expect average selling prices for our products to decline over time as products mature 
our ability to increase revenues in the future is dependent on increased demand for our established products and our ability to develop or acquire new products and subsequently achieve customer acceptance of newly introduced products 
cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold consists primarily of the costs of purchasing silicon wafers  and also includes costs associated with assembly  test and shipping of our ics  costs of personnel and equipment associated with manufacturing support and quality assurance  and occupancy costs 
cost of goods sold also consists of amortization of developed product technology and an intellectual property license agreement purchased through our acquisitions  which are amortized over not more than six years 
because we do not have long term  fixed price supply contracts  our wafer costs are subject to the cyclical demand for semiconductors 
research and development 
research and development expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities  including stock compensation  contractor fees  expenses for development testing and evaluation  mask costs  occupancy costs and depreciation of research and development equipment 
all research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to meeting the changing requirements of our customers and to our overall long term success 
we expect  however  that research and development expenses should decrease in absolute dollars as we reduce our research and development personnel  while continuing to invest in research and development activities to develop new products to be competitive in the future  although such expenses as a percentage of revenues may fluctuate 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and related costs  including stock compensation  occupancy costs  sales commissions to independent sales representatives  amortization of acquired intangible assets and related overhead costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services  as well as marketing activities 
we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses should decrease in absolute dollars as we reduce our personnel and other spending in this area  while continuing to support our future operations 
we also expect to continue to incur litigation expenses in the future as we protect and defend our intellectual property and technology

index to financial statements goodwill impairment and impairment of long lived assets 
we recorded goodwill impairment of million and an million write down of long lived assets for the year ended december  these charges resulted from our annual goodwill impairment analysis and testing for the recoverability of long lived assets 
no such charges were recorded for the year ended december  see note of the notes our notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain on asset disposition 
during the third quarter of  we completed the sale of our pc audio codec product line to idt  for total consideration of million and recorded a pre tax gain of million that is included in the gain on disposition of assets in the consolidated statements of operations 
the consideration consisted of million in cash  million in accounts receivable which we retained  and million in accounts payable assumed by idt 
million of the purchase price was deposited into an escrow account upon closing for purposes of settling indemnification claims for the one year period following the closing and is classified as restricted cash in the consolidated balance sheets 
the cash consideration was offset by million in closing costs 
in july  the company sold a patent to a limited partnership for approximately million 
a gain of approximately  was recognized as a result of this sale and is included in the gain on disposition of assets line in the consolidated statement of operations 
other income expense 
other income consists of interest income and foreign exchange income or losses 
interest income reflects interest earned on cash equivalents and short term investment balances 
foreign exchange loss reflects realized gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
income tax expense 
we accrue federal  state  and foreign income taxes at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for certain items including non deductible expenses  including stock based compensation  tax credits  interest income from tax advantaged investments  as well as changes in our deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the provision for income taxes also includes amounts intended to satisfy unfavorable adjustments by tax authorities in any current or future examination of our income tax returns

revenues for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of 
this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in revenues from our portable multimedia socs 
revenues from the sale of our portable multimedia socs accounted for approximately of total revenue for the year ended december   compared to of for the year ended december  portable multimedia socs 
the decrease in revenues from the sale of our portable multimedia socs was primarily due to a decline in market share  significantly decreased average selling prices and our failure to deliver the stmp xx family of portable multimedia socs and supporting software as early as we had targeted 
we expect the trend of declining average selling prices for existing portable multimedia soc products to continue as these products mature further and as the market becomes more competitive  which may have a negative impact on our future revenues if we cannot sell newer products with enhanced features at relatively higher prices 
the xx family of products is now selling in production quantities and we expect these products to increase as a part of our soc revenue mix in future quarters

index to financial statements audio codecs and other products 
the decrease in revenues from the sale of our audio codecs was due to the reduction in shipments to customers in the personal computer market as a result of the sale of our pc audio codec product line to idt on july  revenues from significant customers 
sales to creative technology  an affiliate until october  were of total revenues during the year ended december   up from during the year ended december  creative technology purchases our standard products at prices and on terms similar to other customers who buy similar products and volumes 
revenues from gmi technology  a distributor until november   located in hong kong and taiwan  decreased from to less than of total revenues during the years ended december  and  respectively  due to decreased sales of our socs that are used in portable digital audio players their customers manufacture  as well as increased sales to direct customers 
sales to asustek computer inc decreased to less than of total revenues during the year ended december   from during the year ended december   due to the sale of the pc audio codec product line and a decrease in demand for our products compared to  when one of their large customers launched its new portable audio player 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues  or gross margin  was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an aggressive pricing program on our portable multimedia socs that targeted the value and mid tier segments of the overall portable multimedia player market 
the lower gross margins were also due to million of amortization of developed technology from acquired companies during the year ended december  we expect the trend of declining average selling prices for existing portable multimedia socs products to continue  which may have a negative impact on our future gross margins if we cannot reduce our associated costs accordingly and sell newer products with enhanced features at relatively higher prices 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased in total dollars to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  included in the total for research and development expense was million for the write off of in process research and development ip r d expenses associated with our acquisitions of rio  protocom and oasis in excluding the million of ip r d expenses from the total research and development expenses  the net increase in research and development expenses from to was million 
this increase was primarily due to the increase in headcount resulting from our acquisitions in late  which increased salary and salary related expense by million  and approximately million in stock compensation expense  resulting from our adoption of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r in the first quarter of fiscal year the increase in expense is also due to our pursuit of new product development opportunities 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december   from million or of revenues  for the year ended december  this dollar increase of million was primarily due to approximately million of stock compensation expense resulting from our adoption of sfas r in the first fiscal quarter of  which was offset by the reduction in expense associated with the pc audio codec product line disposition 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   include million of severance and stock compensation expense recorded in conjunction with the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer 
goodwill impairment and impairment of long lived assets 
we recorded a goodwill impairment of million and an million impairment of long lived assets for the year ended december  these charges resulted from our annual goodwill impairment analysis and a detailed assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets 
the goodwill impairment was primarily the result of a decline in stock price and market capitalization  deterioration of our performance  and slower growth rates for our products and the products of acquired businesses 
the impairment of long lived assets was due to management s changed intentions with the use of particular products 
no such charges were recorded for the year ended december  see note of the notes our notes to consolidated financial statements 
gain on asset disposition 
during the third quarter of  we completed the sale of our pc audio codec product line to idt  for total consideration of million and recorded a pre tax gain of million that is included in the gain on disposition of assets in the consolidated statements of operations 
the consideration consisted of million in cash  million in accounts receivable which we retained  and million in accounts payable assumed by idt

a gain of approximately  was recognized as a result of this sale and is included in the gain on disposition of assets line in the consolidated statement of operations 
other income expense 
interest income decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this was due to decreased income earned on our average cash balances and investments in short term marketable securities during the year ended december  income tax expense 
we had a net income tax benefit of million for the year ended december   compared to a net income tax expense of million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a significant decrease in income loss before income taxes and one time benefits related to a change in our international tax strategy in the second quarter of  offset by non deductible charges related to the impairment of our goodwill in the fourth quarter  the effect of the allocation of non deductible goodwill to the gain on the idt transaction in the third quarter  and a charge to establish a valuation allowance against our net us deferred tax asset as management has determined it is more likely than not that the company will not realize its full value based on current assumptions related to forecasted future income 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was 
this estimate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to one time benefits related to a change in our international tax strategy offset by non deductible charges related to the impairment of our goodwill  the effect of the allocation of non deductible goodwill to the gain on the idt transaction  and a charge to establish a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december   was 
this estimate differed from the statutory rate primarily due to non deductible write offs of acquired in process research and development and charges associated with transferring operations and licensing intellectual property to foreign subsidiaries  offset by research and development tax credits 
comparison of year ended december   to year ended december  revenues 
revenues for the year ended december   were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase was due to an increase in revenues from the sale of our portable multimedia socs of and from the sale of our audio codecs of 
revenues from the sale of our portable multimedia socs and of our audio codecs were and  respectively  of total revenues for the year ended december  portable multimedia socs 
the increase in revenues from the sale of our portable multimedia socs was due to the continued growth of the portable multimedia player market and our competitive position within that market as well as increased unit shipments to support new design wins at certain customers 
the increase in revenues from the sale of our portable multimedia socs was partially offset by declines in our overall average selling prices as certain portable multimedia socs products matured and as a result of an aggressive pricing program on our portable multimedia socs that target the value segment of the overall portable multimedia player market 
audio codecs and other products 
the increase in revenues from the sale of our audio codecs was due to increased unit shipments to support new design wins at certain customers 
revenues from oasis and protocom products totaled million from the closing date of the respective acquisitions through december  revenues from significant customers 
sales to creative technology  an affiliate until october  decreased to of total revenues during the year ended december   from during the year ended december   due to stronger relative demand for our portable multimedia socs from other customers as well as creative technology experiencing softer than expected overall market demand for their portable multimedia players during the period 
creative technology purchases our standard products at prices and on terms similar to other customers who buy similar products and volumes 
revenues from gmi technology  a distributor located in hong kong and taiwan  decreased from to of total revenues during the year ended december  and  respectively  due to increased sales to direct customers 
revenues from holystone enterprise  a distributor located in taiwan  decreased to less than of total revenues during the year ended december   from during the year ended december   primarily due to increases in our direct sales to customers  rather than making such sales through holystone enterprise  and to increased reliance on other distributors to make sales of our portable multimedia socs in geographic regions such as china 
sales to asustek computer inc increased to of total revenues during the year ended december  from less than during the year ended december  due to increased unit shipments resulting from increased demand for our portable multimedia socs by asustek computer inc s customers  primarily apple computer 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues  or gross margin  was for the year ended december   compared with for the year ended december  the slight decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an aggressive

we also expect the trend of declining average selling prices for existing portable multimedia socs products to continue as these products mature further in the market and as the market becomes more competitive  which may have a negative impact on our future margins if we cannot reduce our associated costs accordingly and sell newer products with enhanced features at relatively higher prices 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  this dollar increase of was primarily due to increases in our engineering headcount  including independent contractors  acquired ipr d costs totaling million during the year from the acquisitions of protocom  oasis  and apogee  as well as increases in the costs of design tools and mask sets 
the headcount increases were primarily to support hardware and software development on our latest portable multimedia socs  the stmp xx family of products  audio codecs targeted for applications in the pc market  including the intel high definition audio standard  a new digital fm tuner product  and various usb peripheral ics  as well as development efforts on new audio products for consumer applications 
the protocom ipr d relates to the pr project  a next generation portable imaging soc that adds new features such as h 
an advanced video codec technology and high definition output capability 
the oasis ipr d relates to efforts on six different multi function peripheral products  each of which adds new features or addresses new imaging markets 
the apogee ipr d relates to a next generation direct digital amplification ddx product 
as of the closing date of each acquisition  we expected to incur million  million and million in costs to bring the protocom product  oasis products and apogee product  respectively  to commercialization 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million  or of revenues  for the year ended december   from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  this dollar increase of was primarily due to increases in headcount of sales  marketing  and administrative personnel including a substantial increase in personnel located in the asia pacific region  as well as million in legal costs primarily related to ongoing intellectual property litigation against actions semiconductor  located in china 
the increase was also due to increased lease expenses related to additional leased office space both domestically and internationally  as well as increases in legal expenses related to setting up and maintaining our international subsidiaries 
we paid million in from general corporate funds related to the lease abandonment charge taken in amortization of deferred stock based compensation 
we record deferred stock based compensation for the difference between the exercise price of option grants and the fair value of our common stock at the time of such grants which resulted in amortization expense of million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
other income expense 
interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this was due to increased income earned on our cash balances and investments in short term marketable securities 
income tax expense 
our income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase in expense was primarily due to non deductible charges related to acquisitions in the third fiscal quarter of  and the release of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the third fiscal quarter of our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was

investing activities during the years ended december  and also included proceeds from maturities of and purchases of short term investments  and purchases of property  plant  equipment  software and intangible assets 
the fair value of our investments in marketable securities at december   was million 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
our investment policy is to manage our investment portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in short term securities  with at least an investment grade rating  to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds

we intend to fund these activities with cash generated from operations and existing cash balances 
we anticipate that operating expenses  changes in working capital  and capital expenditures will continue to constitute a material use of our cash resources 
based on current business conditions and our current operating and financial plans  we believe our existing cash  restricted cash and short term investments balances  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for at least the next months 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including our level of revenues  the timing and extent of spending to support product development efforts  the expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of introductions of new products  the costs to ensure access to adequate manufacturing capacity  and the continuing market acceptance of our products 
we could be required  or could elect  to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing and additional funds may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing if needed  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and sales and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial conditions  and operating results 
we may enter into strategic arrangements in the future which also could require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we would have recognized a more significant net loss for the year ended december   if we excluded the million pre tax gain on the sale of our pc audio codec product line to idt and there can be no assurances that we can reduce our net losses and negative cash flow in the foreseeable future 
also  there can be no assurances that we can raise capital as needed to fund our operations on an ongoing basis 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial 
table of contents 
index to financial statements statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to uncollectible accounts receivable  inventories  investments  intangible assets  goodwill  stock based compensation  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from the estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
the following is a discussion of our most critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements  and the judgments and estimates involved under each 
we also have other key accounting policies that do not involve critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are difficult or subjective see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues in accordance with securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab a and b sab and sab  revenue recognition 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment  however  we do not recognize revenue until all customer acceptance requirements have been met  when applicable 
revenues from product sales to customers other than distributors are generally recognized upon shipment and reserves are provided for estimated allowances 
we defer revenue recognition of nonrecurring engineering fees until contractual obligations are met 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for price protection and or rights of return 
product revenue on sales made through these distributors is not recognized until the distributors sell the product to their customers 
customer purchase orders and or contracts are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement 
shipping documents and the completion of any customer acceptance requirements  when applicable  are used to verify product delivery 
management assesses whether a price is fixed or determinable based upon the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
management assesses the collectibility of our accounts receivable based primarily upon the creditworthiness of the customer  as determined by credit checks and analysis  as well as the customer s payment history 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely impacted 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the standard costs of our inventory or its current estimated market value 
we establish inventory reserves at least quarterly for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventories on an amount equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated realizable value  based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory reserves may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
stock based compensation 
prior to fiscal  we accounted for employee stock awards under the company s compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no

 and the related interpretations  as permitted by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
compensation costs related to stock options granted at fair value were not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
compensation costs related to stock options granted below fair value were recognized in the consolidated statements of operations 
in december  fasb issued sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
under the new standard  companies are no longer able to account for share based compensation transactions using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb opinion no 
instead  companies are required to account for such transactions using a fair value method and recognize the expense in their statements of operations 
effective january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  stock compensation cost recognized beginning january  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted or modified on or subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
upon adoption of sfas r  the company elected to use the transition method described in fasb staff position no

results of prior periods have not been restated see note of notes to consolidated financial statement 
on december   we accelerated the vesting of approximately million unvested stock options outstanding under our stock plans with exercise prices per share of or higher 
the options had a range of exercise prices between and

the closing price of our common stock on december   the day our board of directors approved the acceleration  was 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we expensed the remaining unrecognized compensation cost associated with the options with accelerated vesting in the pro forma disclosure 
these actions were taken in order to avoid expense recognition in future financial statements upon adoption of sfas r 
the aggregate pre tax expense associated with the accelerated options that would have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements in future fiscal years was approximately million  which was included in the pro forma disclosure of stock based employee compensation expense for the year ended december  as a result of adopting sfas r on january   our loss before income taxes for the year ended december   included million of stock compensation expense that would not have been recognized if we continued to account for share based compensation under apb opinion no 
applying the provisions of sfas  accounting for income taxes sfas  on an annual basis  the adoption of sfas r had a negative million impact on the net loss for the year ended december  also  basic and diluted loss per share for the same period were higher due to our adopting sfas r 
prior to adopting sfas r  we presented all tax benefits of deductions resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas r requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits from tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
this requirement reduced net operating cash flows and increased net financing cash flows for the year ended december   by approximately million 
the fair value of our stock based awards is estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes valuation calculation requires us to estimate key assumptions such as future stock price volatility  expected terms of the awards  risk free rates and dividend yield 
if our actual experience differs significantly from the assumptions used to compute our stock based compensation cost  or if different assumptions had been used  we may have recorded too much or too little stock based compensation cost 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate of our stock grants and only recognize the expense for those awards expected to vest 
expected forfeiture rates are based on historical rates and our analysis of potential future forfeiture rates 
if the actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different 
we periodically evaluate the assumptions used in the black scholes model  and calculate expected volatility based on a combination of our historical and implied volatility 
we calculate the expected term using the simplified method prescribed in staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment  such that the term is approximated by the mean between the vesting date and the expiration of the award 
we continue to base the estimate of risk free rate on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
we have never paid cash dividends and do not currently intend to pay cash dividends  thus we assume a dividend yield 
during the year ended december   no restricted stock units rsus vested 
we had million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to stock options and rsus at december   that are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate long lived assets held and used by us for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be recoverable 
when such factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value  based on market value when available  or discounted expected cash flows  of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made 
goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at least annually during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill may be impaired 
impairment of goodwill is evaluated using a two step process 
the first step involves a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using a weighted calculation of a discounted cash flow method and a market capitalization method 
these methods require estimates of our future revenues  profits  capital expenditures  working capital  and other relevant factors  as well as selecting appropriate guideline publicly traded companies for each reporting unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans  industry data  and other relevant factors 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the process involves a comparison of the fair value and carrying value of the goodwill of that reporting unit 
if the carrying value of the goodwill of a reporting unit exceeds the fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess

index to financial statements acquired in process research and development ipr d 
when we acquire another entity  or material assets of another entity  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between net tangible assets  ipr d  other identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill 
our policy defines ipr d as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not reached technological feasibility and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to ipr d requires sigmatel to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to ipr d is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of acquisition  in accordance with accepted valuation methods  and includes consideration of the assessed risk of the project not being developed to a stage of commercial feasibility

we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the use of the asset and liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
we then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance is established against deferred tax assets to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely based on the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the temporary differences are deductible 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to taxation in numerous jurisdictions 
the determination of the provision for income taxes requires sigmatel to take positions on certain issues where there is uncertainty in the application of the tax law 
the provision for income taxes includes amounts intended to satisfy unfavorable adjustments by the internal revenue service and tax authorities in other jurisdictions in an examination of sigmatel s income tax returns 
the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties may result in an assessment that is materially different from the current estimate of the liability and may result in significant income tax benefits or expenses being recognized in a future period

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits an entity to elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many financial assets and liabilities 
entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings 
entities electing the fair value option are required to distinguish  on the face of the statement of financial position  the fair value of assets and liabilities for which the fair value option has been elected and similar assets and liabilities measured using another measurement attribute 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year 
the adjustment to reflect the difference between the fair value and the carrying amount would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the date of initial adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas is definitional and disclosure oriented and addresses how companies should approach measuring fair value when required by gaap  it does not create or modify any current gaap requirements to apply fair value accounting 
sfas provides a single definition for fair value that is to be applied consistently for all accounting applications  and also generally describes and prioritizes according to reliability the methods and inputs used in valuations 
sfas prescribes various disclosures about financial statement categories and amounts which are measured at fair value  if such disclosures are not already specified elsewhere in gaap 
the new measurement and disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our financial position and results of operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  money market funds  government and non government debt securities and certificates of deposit 
the risk associated with fluctuating interest rates is limited to our investment portfolio and we do not believe that a change in interest rates would have a significant impact on the market value of our investments 
as of december   all of our investments were in money market accounts or investment grade securities 
foreign currency risks 
we are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
sales and inventory purchases made by us and our subsidiaries are denominated in us dollars 
a small percentage of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar 
any currency risks related to these transactions are deemed to be immaterial to us as a whole
