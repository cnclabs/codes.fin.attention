overview the st 
joe company is one of the largest real estate development companies in florida 
we believe we have one of the largest inventories of private land suitable for development in florida 
the majority of our land is located in northwest florida and has a very low cost basis 
in order to optimize the value of these core real estate assets  we seek to reposition our substantial timberland holdings for higher and better uses 
we increase the value of our raw land assets through the entitlement  development and subsequent sale of residential and commercial parcels  home sites and homes  or through the direct sale of unimproved land 
we have four operating segments residential real estate  commercial real estate  rural land sales and forestry 
our residential real estate segment generates revenues from the sale of developed home sites to retail customers and builders  the sale of parcels of entitled  undeveloped land  the sale of housing units built by us  rental income  resort and club operations  investments in limited partnerships and joint ventures  brokerage  title issuance and mortgage origination fees on certain transactions within our residential real estate developments  and management fees 
our commercial real estate segment generates revenues from the rental and or sale of commercial buildings owned and or developed by us  and the sale of developed and undeveloped land for retail  multi family  office and industrial uses 
our rural land sales segment generates revenues from the sale of parcels of undeveloped land  and the sale of developed home sites primarily within rural settings 
our forestry segment generates revenues from the sale of pulpwood and timber  and the sale of cypress lumber and mulch 
our ability to obtain land use entitlements for our properties is a key requirement in repositioning our land to higher and better uses and for the generation of revenues 
we continue to plan and obtain entitlements for an increasingly diverse set of land uses including residential  retail  office  industrial and multi family uses 

table of contents at the end of  we had land use entitlements in hand or in process for approximately  residential units and million square feet of commercial space  with an additional acres zoned for commercial uses 
during  florida  like many other states across the nation  experienced a dramatic slowdown in its real estate markets 
this real estate slowdown was reflected in our results of operations for the year in which we experienced a decline in net income 
the slowdown has also led to high levels of residential resale inventories in our florida markets  although recently we have seen an increasing level of sales center traffic in our residential projects 
due to existing market conditions  we are making a number of adjustments in our communities 
the pricing of some of our resort and seasonal product is being revised to reflect current market conditions 
we are also lengthening the required time periods for home site purchasers to start construction of their homes 
and  with completed homes now in greater demand than home sites  we are seeking new alliances with homebuilders to bring finished product to market in our communities 
we are committed to long term value creation  further diversification of our development business and generating land sales over a broader range of uses and price points 
regardless of negative short term market conditions  we believe that long term prospects for florida  driven by job growth and coupled with strong in migration population expansion  will be favorable over the long term 
during the third quarter  we announced that we are exiting the florida homebuilding business to focus on maximizing the value of our landholdings through place making 
for the last several years  we have built homes in our towns in part because there was limited homebuilding capacity in northwest florida 
as markets in the region have matured  homebuilding capacity from national  regional and local homebuilders has expanded significantly 
under our exit plan  our homebuilding operations will wind down by mid we are continuing to develop our relationships with national  regional and local homebuilders see residential real estate segment below 
we have executed purchase and option contracts with several national and regional homebuilders for the purchase of developed lots in various communities 
these transactions involve land positions in pre development phases of our communities as well as phases currently under development 
these transactions provide opportunities for us to accelerate value realization  while at the same time decreasing capital intensity and increasing efficiency in how we deliver housing to the market 
we expect national and regional homebuilders to be important business partners going forward 
during late and early  we implemented certain corporate organizational changes designed to position joe for the years ahead 
we eliminated certain redundancies among our field and corporate operations  and put in place a regional management structure to oversee our various product lines within specific geographical areas 
we believe our new organization will facilitate the development of groups of projects with multifaceted real estate product types 
as discussed further below  as a result of our exit from florida homebuilding and corporate reorganization  we recorded a restructuring charge of million during we expect to incur an additional charge of million in critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  equity  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
additionally  we evaluate the results of these estimates on an on going basis 
management s estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investment in real estate and cost of real estate sales 
costs associated with a specific real estate project are capitalized once we determine that the project is economically probable 
we capitalize costs directly associated with development and construction of identified real estate projects 
indirect costs that clearly relate to a specific project under development  such as internal costs of a regional project field office  are also capitalized 
we capitalize interest based on the amount of underlying expenditures up to total interest expense  and real estate taxes on real estate projects under development 
if we determine not to complete a project  any previously capitalized costs are expensed in the period such determination is made 
real estate inventory costs include land and common development costs such as roads  sewers and amenities  multi family construction costs  capitalized property taxes  capitalized interest and certain indirect costs 
a portion of real estate inventory and estimates for costs to complete are allocated to each unit based on the relative sales value of each unit as compared to the estimated sales value of the total project 
these estimates are reevaluated at least annually  with any adjustments being allocated prospectively to the remaining units available for sale 
the accounting estimate related to inventory valuation is susceptible to change due to the use of assumptions about future sales proceeds and related real estate expenditures 
management s assumptions about future housing and home site sales prices  sales volume and sales velocity require significant judgment because the real estate market is cyclical and highly sensitive to changes in economic conditions 
in addition  actual results could differ from management s estimates due to changes in anticipated development  construction and overhead costs 
although we have not made significant adjustments affecting real estate gross profit margins in the past  there can be no assurances that estimates used to generate future real estate gross profit margins will not differ from our current estimates 
construction costs for single family homes are determined based upon actual costs incurred 
revenue recognition percentage of completion 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  revenue for multi family residences under construction is recognized using the percentage of completion method when construction is beyond a preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for nondelivery of the unit  sufficient units have already been sold to assure that the entire property will not revert to rental property  sales price is assured  and aggregate sales proceeds and costs can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is then recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
percentage of completion accounting is also used for our home site sales when required development is not complete at the time of sale and for commercial and other land sales if there are uncompleted development costs yet to be incurred for the property sold 
impairment of long lived assets and goodwill 
our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if we determine that an impairment exists due to the inability to recover an asset s carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeded estimated fair value 
if such assets were held for sale  the provision for loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value less costs to sell 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods to determine fair value  such as i discounting expected future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
the fair value determined under these methods can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors  including changes in the general economy of our markets  demand for real estate and the projected net operating income for a specific property 
goodwill is carried at the lower of cost or fair value and is tested for impairment at least annually  or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted  by comparing the carrying amount of the net assets of each reporting unit with goodwill to the fair value of the reporting unit taken as a whole 
the impairment review involves a number of assumptions and estimates including estimating discounted future cash flows  net operating income  future economic conditions  fair value of assets held and discount rates 
if this comparison indicates that the goodwill of a particular reporting unit is impaired  the 
table of contents aggregate of the fair value of each of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit are compared to the fair value of the reporting unit to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
intangible assets 
we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired based on their respective fair values  using customary estimates of fair value  including data from appraisals  comparable sales  discounted cash flow analysis and other methods 
these fair values can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors and estimates  including changes in the general economy of our markets  demand for real estate  lease terms  amortization periods and fair market values assigned to leases as well as fair value assigned to customer relationships 
pension plan 
we sponsor a cash balance defined benefit pension plan covering a majority of our employees 
currently  our pension plan is over funded and contributes income to the company 
the accounting for pension benefits is determined by standardized accounting and actuarial methods using numerous estimates  including discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets  employee turnover  mortality and retirement ages  and future salary increases 
changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the income contributed by the pension plan 
we engage the services of an independent actuary and investment consultant to assist us in determining these assumptions and in the calculation of pension income 
for example  in  a increase in the assumed long term rate of return on pension assets would have resulted in a million increase in pre tax income million net of tax 
a decrease in the assumed long term rate of return would have caused an equivalent decrease in pre tax income 
a increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate would have resulted in less than a million change in pre tax income 
stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by the stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of other variables 
these variables include expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors term of option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by incorporating the contractual term of the options and analyzing employees  actual and expected exercise behaviors 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using historical volatility in market price over a period consistent with the expected term  and other factors 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model on us treasury seven year issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an estimated dividend yield in the option valuation model 
income taxes 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  significant management judgment is required to estimate our income taxes 
our estimates are based on our interpretation of federal and state tax laws 
we estimate our actual current tax due and assess temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
the temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets based upon our analysis of the timing and reversal of future taxable amounts and our history and future expectations of taxable income 
adjustments may be required by a change in assessment of our deferred tax assets and liabilities  changes due to audit adjustments by federal and state tax authorities  and changes in tax laws 
to the extent adjustments are required in any given period  we will include the adjustments in the tax provision in our financial statements 
these adjustments could materially impact our financial position  cash flow and results of operation 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting and reporting for uncertainties in income tax law 
this interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition  measurement  presentation and disclosure of 
table of contents uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns 
we will adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of the cumulative effects  if any  of applying fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fin on our consolidated financial statements  but are not yet in a position to determine its impact 
in september  the fasb issued sfas statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas applies only to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards and is expected to increase the consistency of those measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe sfas will have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides guidance for sec registrants on how the effects of uncorrected errors originating in previous years should be considered when quantifying errors in the current year 
sab was issued to eliminate diversity in practice for quantifying uncorrected prior year misstatements including prior year unadjusted audit differences and to address weaknesses in methods commonly used to quantify such misstatements 
these methods are the income statement or rollover method and the balance sheet or iron curtain method 
the company has historically followed the income statement method 
under sab  sec registrants will now have to evaluate errors under both methods 
sab provides transitional guidance that allows registrants to report the effect of adoption as a cumulative adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings 
if a cumulative adjustment is reported  it must be reported as of the beginning of the first fiscal year ending after november  sab did not have an impact on our financial statements at december  in september  the sec emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf issue no 
 applicability of the assessment of a buyer s continuing investment under fas no 
for the sale of condominiums eitf 
eitf states that in assessing the collectibility of the sales price pursuant to paragraph d of fas  an entity should evaluate the adequacy of the buyer s initial and continuing investment to conclude that the sales price is collectible 
if an entity is unable to meet the criteria of paragraph  including an assessment of collectibility using the initial and continuing investment tests described in paragraphs of fas  then the entity should apply the deposit method as described in paragraphs of fas eitf is effective for the company s fiscal year beginning january  we have not yet assessed the impact of eitf on our consolidated financial statements  but we believe that we will be required  in most cases  to collect additional deposits from buyers in order to recognize revenue under the percentage of completion method of accounting 
if we are unable to meet the requirements of eitf  we would be required to recognize revenue using the deposit method  which would delay revenue recognition until consumation of the sale

difference change difference change dollars in millions revenues real estate sales rental timber sales other total expenses cost of real estate sales cost of rental revenues cost of timber sales cost of other revenues other operating expenses total the decreases in revenues from real estate sales and costs of real estate sales were in each case primarily due to decreased sales in the residential real estate segment and  to a lesser extent  the commercial real estate segment 
the decreases were partially offset by an increase in sales of rural land 
additionally  during and  four buildings were sold in each year by the commercial real estate segment and recorded as discontinued operations  and during  two buildings were sold by the commercial real estate segment and recorded as discontinued operations 
the increases in rental revenues and costs of rental revenues were in each case primarily due to the purchase of commercial buildings 
timber revenue increased in due to an increase in harvest volumes and in decreased due to price decreases 
cost of timber sales increased in due to increased logging costs caused primarily by higher fuel prices and road maintenance costs 
cost of timber sales decreased in due to lower costs in the timber operation resulting from lower sales 
the decrease in other revenues and related gross profit of other revenues was primarily due to decreased resale brokerage activity and increased resort costs 
other revenues and cost of other revenues increased in primarily due to increases in resort operations

for further discussion of revenues and expenses  see segment results below 
corporate expense 
corporate expense  representing corporate general and administrative expenses  increased million  or  to million in over the increase was primarily due to increased stock compensation and other compensation costs 
stock compensation costs increased million primarily as a result of the acceleration of restricted stock amortization related to the retirement of our former president coo and stock compensation expense recorded under sfas r 
other compensation costs

segment results residential real estate our residential real estate segment develops large scale  mixed use resort  primary and seasonal residential communities  primarily on land we own with very low cost basis 
we own large tracts of land in northwest florida  including significant gulf of mexico beach frontage and waterfront properties  and land near jacksonville  in deland and near tallahassee  the state capital 
our residential homebuilding business in north and south carolina is conducted through saussy burbank  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary 

table of contents residential sales slowed significantly in  particularly in our resort markets 
as a result of the slowdown  inventories of resale homes and home sites have risen dramatically in our markets 
these resale inventory levels will continue to impact sales of our products in the majority of our markets throughout although we believe these inventory levels may be trending downward by the end of  we continue to believe it could take until before a supply demand balance begins to return 
during the third quarter of  we announced that we are exiting the florida homebuilding business to focus on maximizing the value of our landholdings through place making 
there was no material impact to our financial results in related to our exit from florida homebuilding  other than the restructuring charge 
the exit move was made possible by our expanding relationships with local  regional and national homebuilders 
we have executed purchase and option contracts with several national and regional homebuilders for the purchase of developed lots in various joe communities 
these transactions involve land positions in pre development phases as well as phases currently under development 
these transactions provide opportunities for us to accelerate value realization  while at the same time decreasing capital intensity and increasing efficiency in the delivery of finished homes to the market 
during the period from april through december   we had a total of  developed home sites under contract or under option with david weekley homes and beazer homes  of which remain to be closed 
we expect national and regional homebuilders to be important business partners going forward

revenue on contracted units is recognized in proportion to the percentage of total costs incurred in relation to estimated total costs 
if a deposit is received for less than for a multi family or prc unit  percentage of completion accounting is not utilized 
instead  full accrual accounting criteria are used  which requires recognition of revenue when sales contracts are closed 
all deposits are non refundable subject to a day rescission period as required by law  except for non delivery of the unit 
in the event a contract does not close for reasons other than non delivery  we are entitled to retain the deposit 
in such instances  the revenue and margin related to the previously recorded contract is reversed 
revenues and cost of sales associated with multi family units where construction has been completed before contracts are entered into and deposits made are recognized on the full accrual method of accounting as contracts are closed 
our townhomes are attached building units sold individually along with a parcel of land 
revenues and cost of sales for our townhomes are accounted for using the full accrual method 
these units differ from multi family and prc units  in which buyers hold title to a unit or fractional share of a unit  respectively  within a building and an interest in the underlying land held in common with other building association members 
profit is deferred on home site sales when required development is not complete at the time of the sale 
currently  we are deferring a portion of profit from home site sales at watersound west beach  summercamp and rivercamps on crooked creek 
homesite sales are recorded at the time of closing  but a portion of revenue and gross profit on the sales at those communities is deferred based on required development not yet completed in relation to total required development costs and recognized by the percentage of completion method as the work is completed

in our northwest florida resort communities  closed units  revenues and gross profit decreased significantly in compared to as the demand for resort residential product has decreased 
the gross profit from home site sales decreased to million in from million in due primarily to decreases in the number of home sites closed in summercamp  rivercamps on crooked creek  watercolor and watersound beach 
the decreases resulting from these reduced closings were partially offset by closings in watersound and windmark beach as sales of home sites in these communities commenced in the second and third quarters of  respectively

the land sales segment prepares land for sale for these uses through harvesting  thinning and other silviculture practices  and in some cases  limited infrastructure development

table of contents forestry 
the table below sets forth the results of operations of our forestry segment for the three years ended december  years ended december  in millions revenues timber sales expenses cost of timber sales other operating expenses depreciation and amortization impairment loss total expenses other income pre tax income from continuing operations total revenues for the forestry segment increased million  or  compared to sales under our fiber agreement with smurfit stone container corporation were million  tons in and million  tons in sales to other customers totaled million  tons in as compared to million  tons in the increase in revenue and tons sold to outside customers resulted from our ability to harvest more solid wood products due to better operating conditions and planning 
revenues for the cypress mill operation were million in and million in revenues from the cypress mill were lower in due to the lack of customer demand for our mulch product 
cost of sales for the forestry segment increased million in compared to costs of sales as a percentage of revenue were in and in the increase in cost of sales was due to increased logging costs caused by higher diesel fuel prices and increased road maintenance expense 
cost of sales for the cypress mill operation were million or of revenues in and million or of revenues in during  the company utilized a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of sunshine state cypress and recorded an impairment loss to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill from million to million 
this resulted in an impairment loss of million pre tax  or million net of tax 
revenues for the forestry segment in decreased million  or  compared to total sales under the fiber agreement with smurfit stone container corporation were million  tons in and million  tons in sales to other customers totaled million  tons in and million  tons in the decrease in revenues under the fiber agreement was primarily due to lower pulpwood prices under the terms of the agreement 
in and  sales to other customers decreased due to management s decision to reduce the harvested volume from clear cut operations in order to retain more timber on certain tracts planned for later sale for recreational or residential purposes

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we generate cash from operations  sales of land holdings  other assets and subsidiaries  borrowings from financial institutions and other debt  and issuances of equity  primarily from the exercise of employee stock options 
we use cash for operations  real estate development  construction and homebuilding  repurchases of our common stock  payments of dividends  repayments of debt  payments of taxes  and investments in joint ventures and acquisitions 
management believes we have adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the continued investment in real estate developments 
in light of current real estate market conditions  however  we have significantly adjusted our capital investment plans and continue to evaluate the appropriateness of our plans 
we also intend to continue to be prudent in our approach toward share repurchase activity in considering our other capital commitments 
if our liquidity were not adequate to fund our cash requirements  we would have various alternatives available to change our cash flow  including reducing or eliminating our share repurchase program  reducing or eliminating dividends  changing our capital structure  altering the timing of our development projects and or selling existing assets 
cash flows from operating activities cash flows related to assets ultimately planned to be sold  including residential real estate development and related amenities  sales of undeveloped and developed land by the rural land sales segment  the company s timberland operations and land developed by the commercial real estate segment  are included in operating activities on the statement of cash flows 
distributions of income from unconsolidated affiliates are also included in cash flows from operating activities 
net cash used in provided by operations was million during compared to million in and million in expenditures relating to our residential real estate segment in  and were million  million and million  respectively 
expenditures for operating properties in  and totaled million  and million  respectively  and were made up of commercial land development and residential club and resort property development 
the changes in other tax related balance sheet accounts were primarily related to million in estimated tax payments related to the tax year 
these tax payments were primarily attributable to the recognition of previously deferred gains on land sales and involuntary conversions  which have now met the criteria for recognition in our tax return 
we also expect to make significant tax payments in related to an irs audit of the years the balances expected to be affected by any tax settlement include other liabilities  taxes payable and deferred taxes 
we expect to continue to make significant cash payments of income taxes  including deferred taxes  in future years 
the expenditures for operating activities relating to our residential real estate and commercial real estate segments were primarily for site infrastructure development  general amenity construction  construction of 
table of contents single family homes  construction of multi family buildings and commercial land development 
in  approximately of these expenditures were for home construction that generally takes place after the signing of a binding contract with a buyer to purchase the home upon completion of construction 
due to our exit from florida homebuilding  we expect a significant reduction in construction expenditures related to single family homes after we finish the homes currently under construction in florida 
total expenditures for single family home construction in the future are expected to decline significantly and the resulting percentage of total expenditures may significantly change depending on the total amount of non homebuilding construction activity in future periods 
over the next several years  our need for cash for operations will remain significant as development activity continues 
during  we had five new residential communities requiring significant up front capital investment  and these communities will continue to require capital expenditures 
cash flows from investing activities the company s buildings developed for commercial rental purposes and assets purchased with tax deferred proceeds are held for investment purposes and related cash flows from acquisitions and dispositions of those assets are included in investing activities on the statements of cash flows 
cash flows from investing activities also include related cash flows from assets not held for sale 
distributions of capital from unconsolidated affiliates are included in cash flows from investing activities 
net cash provided by used in investing activities was million in compared to million in and million in net cash provided in primarily was a result of million in proceeds related to the sales of discontinued operations 
net cash used in included million in proceeds from sales of discontinued operations  net of cash included in assets sold 
purchases of investments in real estate in included million for the purchase of a commercial office building and related intangible assets net of assumption of a mortgage on the property of million  the purchases of acres of property in manatee county for million and  acres of timberland in southwest georgia for million  in tax deferred like kind exchanges and million of other real estate investments 
net cash used in investing activities in included million for the purchase of five commercial office buildings and related intangible assets  million in proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations and million of other real estate investments 
the purchase of commercial buildings and land  comprising the majority of the cash used in investing activities  generally follow the sale of real estate  principally land sales on a tax deferred basis 
the tax deferral requires the reinvestment of proceeds from qualifying sales within a required time frame 
we make these investments in buildings and land only when we can acquire these assets at attractive prices 
it is becoming increasingly difficult to acquire assets that meet our pricing and other criteria for reinvestment  and as a result we may not purchase commercial buildings and vacant land to the extent we have in the past 
additionally  as our sales activity has slowed  the amount of cash available for purchase activities has decreased 
we have recently entered into a listing agreement for the marketing and potential disposition of our office building portfolio 
our portfolio is located in seven markets throughout the southeast and consists of seventeen buildings with approximately million of net rentable square feet 
the potential sale proceeds related to this asset disposition could have a significant positive impact on investing cash flows in if such a sale were to occur 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million in  million in and million in as a result of the significant development and investing activities anticipated over the next several years  we expect our debt to increase compared to december  levels 
in  we have approximately million of debt maturing  and we expect to spend million to million for dividend payments and the repurchase of shares 
based on these factors  we expect a meaningful increase in debt during this debt increase may not occur  however  and our debt may in fact decrease if we were to sell our office building portfolio as described above 

table of contents in  we entered into a new four year million senior revolving credit facility the credit facility 
the credit facility bears interest based on leverage levels at libor plus an applicable margin in the range of to 
the credit facility contains financial covenants including maximum debt ratios and minimum fixed charge coverage and net worth requirements 
the balance outstanding at december  was million  no balance was outstanding on the credit facility at december  management believes that we were in compliance with the covenants of the credit facility at december  in february  we increased the size of the credit facility to million 
none of the material terms of the credit facility were changed in connection with the expansion 
proceeds from the increased credit facility will be used for the repayment of debt maturing in  development and construction projects and general corporate purposes 
senior notes issued in private placements had an outstanding principal amount of million at december  and million at december  these senior notes have financial performance covenants similar to those in the credit facility 
in july  we entered into an amendment agreement with the noteholders that modifies certain financial covenants 
the amendment provides increased leverage capacity along with increased flexibility in maintaining minimum net worth levels 
the covenant modifications were subject to certain conditions  including prepayment of our million outstanding senior notes 
we paid these notes in november the proceeds of the senior notes were used to finance development and construction projects  as well as for general corporate purposes 
during  we assumed an existing mortgage of million on a commercial building we purchased 
we have used community development district cdd bonds to finance the construction of infrastructure improvements at six of our projects 
the principal and interest payments on the bonds are paid by assessments on  or from sales proceeds of  the properties benefited by the improvements financed by the bonds 
we record a liability for future assessments which are fixed or determinable and will be levied against our properties 
in  we paid million in principal to one of the community development districts to pay off a portion of the cdd bonds 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  accounting for special assessments and tax increment financing  we have recorded as debt million and million related to cdd bonds as of december  and  respectively 
through december   our board of directors had authorized a total of million for the repurchase of our outstanding common stock from shareholders from time to time the stock repurchase program  of which million remained available at december  there is no expiration date for the stock repurchase program  and the specific timing and amount of repurchases will vary based on available cash  market conditions  securities law limitations and other factors 
from the inception of the stock repurchase program to december   the company repurchased from shareholders  shares 
during  and  the company repurchased from shareholders   and  shares  respectively 
given the challenges presented by the current operating environment  we will be prudent in our approach to share repurchase activity over the near term until the depth and duration of the current downturn in the residential market is more readily discernible 
as a result  we did not purchase any of our shares on the open market during the fourth quarter of executives have surrendered a total of  shares of our stock since in payment of strike prices and taxes due on exercised stock options and vested restricted stock 
for  and   shares worth million   shares worth million and  shares worth million  respectively  were surrendered by executives  of which million  million and million  respectively  were for the cash payment of taxes due on exercised stock options and vested restricted stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk related to our long term debt 
as of december   there was million outstanding under our credit facility  which matures on july  this debt accrues interest at different rates based on timing of the loan and our preferences  but generally will be either the one  two  three or six month london interbank offered rate libor plus a libor margin in effect at the time of the loan 
this loan potentially subjects us to interest rate risk relating to the change in the libor rates 
we manage our interest rate exposure by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
if libor had been basis points higher or lower  the effect on net income with respect to interest expense on the credit facility would have been a respective decrease or increase in the amount of million pre tax million net of tax 
we have recently expanded the available principal amount of the credit facility to million  and we expect the outstanding balance borrowed under the credit facility to increase in the near term 
an increase in borrowing under the credit facility will cause a corresponding increase in interest rate risk 
the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year of maturity for our long term debt
