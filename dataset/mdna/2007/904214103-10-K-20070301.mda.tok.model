executive overview in  umpqua continued to demonstrate solid financial performance coupled with many significant accomplishments  some of which were not necessarily reflected in our operating results 
during the past year  we completed the acquisition and integration of western sierra bancorp and its principal operating subsidiaries  western sierra national bank  central california bank  lake community bank and auburn community bank 
the transaction  valued at million  was an all stock exchange with million shares of common stock issued in connection with the acquisition 
achieved strong organic asset growth which excludes growth from acquisition as of the merger date of 
total consolidated assets as of december  were billion  compared to billion at december   an increase of billion or 
the western sierra acquisition accounted for billion of the growth 
maintained double digit organic growth in loans 
total gross loans and leases were billion as of december   compared to billion at december   an increase of billion or 

table of contents the western sierra acquisition accounted for billion of the growth 
organic loan growth was in continued double digit organic growth in deposits 
total deposits were billion as of december   compared to billion at december   an increase of billion or 
the western sierra acquisition accounted for billion of the growth 
organic deposit growth was in maintained exceptional credit quality standards  with net charge offs of only of average loans  a decrease from in the ratio of non performing assets to total assets decreased to at december  from at december  our provision for loan and lease losses was million during  comparable to million for the prior year 
increased our net income per diluted share by to in from per diluted share earned in increased our cash dividends by from declared in the first and second quarter to declared in the third and fourth quarters of opened new stores in medford  bend and lake oswego in oregon and antelope and lincoln in california as well as our first two neighborhood stores in portland  oregon 
however  the past year was not without some challenges including our net interest margin compressed due to increases in short term market interest rates which led to an increase in deposit and borrowing costs 
the fully tax equivalent net interest margin for was  down basis points from in january  we announced the signing of a definitive agreement for the company to acquire north bay bancorp and its principal operating subsidiary  the vintage bank  along with its solano bank division 
the agreement provides for north bay bancorp shareholders to receive shares of the company s common stock for each share of north bay bancorp common stock  subject to adjustment in limited circumstances  giving the acquisition a total value of approximately million 
this transaction is expected to close during the second quarter of upon completion of the acquisition expected in the second quarter of  all the vintage bank and solano bank branches will operate under the umpqua bank name 
the acquisition will add north bay bancorp s network of northern california branches  including locations in the napa area and in the communities of st 
helena  american canyon  vacaville  benicia  vallejo and fairfield  to our network of northern california  oregon and washington locations and result in a combined institution with assets of approximately billion 
summary of critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in future periods 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
not all of these critical accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
management believes that the following policies would be considered critical under the sec s definition 
allowance for loan and lease losses and reserve for unfunded commitments the bank performs regular credit reviews of the loan and lease portfolio to determine the credit quality of the portfolio and the adherence to underwriting standards 
when loans and leases are originated  they are assigned a risk rating from to that is assessed periodically during the term of the loan through the credit review process 
the risk rating categories are a primary factor in determining an appropriate amount for the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank has a management alll committee  which is responsible for  among other things  regular review of the alll methodology  including loss factors  and ensuring that it is designed and applied in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the alll committee reviews loans that have been placed on non accrual status and approves placing loans on impaired status 
the alll committee also approves removing loans that are no longer impaired from impairment and non accrual status 
the bank s audit and compliance committee provides board oversight of the alll process and reviews and approves the alll methodology on a quarterly basis 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation each risk rating is assessed an inherent credit loss factor that determines the amount of the allowance for loan and lease losses provided for that group of loans and leases with similar risk rating 
credit loss factors may vary by region based on management s belief that there may ultimately be different credit loss rates experienced in each region 
regular credit reviews of the portfolio also identify loans that are considered potentially impaired 
potentially impaired loans are referred to the alll committee which reviews and approves designated loans as impaired 
a loan is considered impaired when based on current information and events  we determine that we will probably not be able to collect all amounts due according to the loan contract  including scheduled interest payments 
when we identify a loan as impaired  we measure the impairment using discounted cash flows  except when the sole remaining source of the repayment for the loan is the liquidation of the collateral 
in these cases  we use the current fair value of the collateral  less selling costs  instead of discounted cash flows 
if we determine that the value of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  we recognize this impairment reserve as a specific component to be provided for in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the combination of the risk rating based allowance component and the impairment reserve allowance component lead to an allocated allowance for loan and lease losses 
the bank also maintains an unallocated allowance amount to provide for other credit losses inherent in a loan portfolio that may not have been contemplated in the credit loss factors 
this unallocated amount generally comprises less than of the allowance 
the unallocated amount is reviewed periodically based on trends in credit losses  the results of credit reviews and overall economic trends 
the reserve for unfunded commitments ruc is established to absorb inherent losses associated with our commitment to lend funds  such as with a letter or line of credit 
the adequacy of the all and ruc are monitored on a regular basis and are based on management s evaluation of numerous factors 
these factors include the quality of the current loan portfolio  the trend in the loan portfolio s risk ratings  current economic conditions  loan concentrations  loan growth rates  past due and non performing trends  evaluation of specific loss estimates for all significant problem loans  historical charge off and recovery experience  and other pertinent information 
management believes that the alll was adequate as of december  there is  however  no assurance that future loan losses will not exceed the levels provided for in the alll and could possibly result in additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses 
in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review 
approximately of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate  and a significant decline in real estate market values may require an increase in the allowance for loan and lease losses 
mortgage servicing rights retained mortgage servicing rights are measured by allocating the carrying value of the loans between the assets sold and the interest retained  based on their relative fair values at the date of the sale 
subsequent measurements are determined using a discounted cash flow model 
mortgage servicing rights are amortized over the expected life of the loan and are evaluated periodically for impairment 
the expected life of the loan can vary from management s estimates due to prepayments by borrowers  especially when rates fall 
prepayments in excess of management s estimates would negatively impact the recorded value of the mortgage servicing rights 
the value of the mortgage servicing rights is also dependent upon the discount rate used in the model 
management reviews this rate on an ongoing basis based on current market rates 
a significant increase in the discount rate would reduce the value of mortgage servicing rights 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets at december   we had million in goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of business combinations 
goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives are periodically evaluated for impairment 
management s impairment analysis determined that there was no impairment as of december  the valuation is based on discounted cash flows or observable market prices on a segment basis 
a or decrease in market price is not expected to result in an impairment 
if impairment was deemed to exist  a write down of the asset would occur with a charge to earnings 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  a revision to the previously issued guidance on accounting for stock options and other forms of equity based compensation 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize in the income statement the grant date fair value of stock options and other equity based forms of compensation issued to employees over the employees requisite service period generally the vesting period 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated as of the grant date using the black scholes 
table of contents option pricing model 
this involves assumptions calculated using management s best estimates at the time of the grant  which impacts the fair value of the option calculated under the black scholes methodology and  ultimately  the expense that will be recognized over the life of the option

in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities to be initially measured at fair value 
in addition  entities are permitted to choose to either subsequently measure servicing rights at fair value and report changes in fair value in earnings  or amortize servicing rights in proportion to and over the estimated net servicing income or loss and assess the rights for impairment 
beginning with the fiscal year in which an entity adopts sfas no 
 it may elect to subsequently measure a class of servicing assets and liabilities at fair value 
post adoption  an entity may make this election as of the beginning of any fiscal year 
an entity that elects to subsequently measure a class of servicing assets and liabilities at fair value should apply that election to all new and existing recognized servicing assets and liabilities within that class 
the effect of remeasuring an existing class of servicing assets and liabilities at fair value is to be reported as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
for the company  this standard became effective on january  and the company elected to measure mortgage servicing assets and liabilities at fair value subsequent to adoption 
the company does not expect the impact of initial adoption of sfas no 
will be material on its financial statements 
results of operations overview for the year ended december   net income was million  or per diluted share  an increase of on a per diluted share basis over the improvement in diluted earnings per share for is principally attributable to improved net interest income  partially offset by increased operating expenses 
we completed the acquisition of western sierra bancorp on june  and the results of the acquired operations are only included in our financial results starting on june  net income for was million  or per diluted share  an increase of on a per diluted share basis over income from continuing operations for the year ended december   was million  or per diluted share  an increase of on a per diluted share basis over income from continuing operations for the improvement in diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for was principally attributable to improved net interest income  offset in part by a decrease in mortgage banking revenue and increased operating expenses 
we completed the acquisition of humboldt on july   and the results of the acquired operations are only included in our financial results starting on july  we incur significant expenses related to the completion and integration of mergers 
accordingly  we believe that our operating results are best measured on a comparative basis excluding the impact of merger related expenses  net of tax 
we define operating income as income before merger related expenses  net of tax  and we calculate operating income per diluted share by dividing operating income by the same diluted share total used in determining diluted earnings per share 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation over the prior year see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
operating income and operating income per diluted share are considered non gaap financial measures 
although we believe the presentation of non gaap financial measures provides a better indication of our operating performance  readers of this report are urged to review the gaap results as presented in the financial statements and supplementary data in item below 
the following table presents a reconciliation of operating income and operating income per diluted share to net income and net income per diluted share for years ended december   and reconciliation of operating income to net income years ended december  in thousands  except per share data net income merger related expenses  net of tax operating income per diluted share net income merger related expenses  net of tax operating income the following table presents the returns on average assets  average shareholders equity and average tangible shareholders equity for the years ended december   and for each of the years presented  the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income and income from continuing operations  and operating income as shown in the table above 
our return on average shareholders equity is negatively impacted as the result of capital required to support goodwill under bank regulatory guidelines 
to the extent this performance metric is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger related intangible assets  we believe it beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible shareholders equity 
the return on average tangible shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders equity less average intangible assets 
the return on average tangible shareholders equity is considered a non gaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average shareholders equity

table of contents discontinued operations during the fourth quarter of  we completed a strategic review of our merchant bankcard portfolio 
the review concluded that shareholder value would be maximized  on a risk adjusted basis  through a sale of the portfolio to a third party 
in december  the bank sold its merchant bankcard portfolio to a third party for million in cash  resulting in a gain on sale after selling costs and related expenses of million  or million after tax 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the operating results related to the merchant bankcard portfolio including the gain on sale have been reclassified as income from discontinued operations  net of tax  for all periods presented 
we retained no ongoing liability related to the portfolio subsequent to the sale and entered into an agreement whereby we will refer all merchant applications exclusively to the buyer for a period of seven years 
in consideration for the referrals  we will receive remuneration for each accepted application and an on going royalty based on a percentage of net revenue generated by the account as defined in the agreement 
we do not expect the referral revenue will have a material impact on our non interest income 
in and  we recognized no revenue related to the merchant bankcard portfolio 
the revenue related to the merchant bankcard portfolio was  in as a result of the sale  we will no longer have the benefit of this revenue stream 
since  for the year ended december   merchant bankcard revenue comprised only about of total non interest income  the loss of revenue did not have a material impact on our results of operations in and additional information on discontinued operations is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
net interest income net interest income is the largest source of our operating income 
net interest income for was million  an increase of million  or over this increase over is attributable to growth in outstanding average interest earning assets  primarily loans and leases  partially offset by both growth in interest bearing liabilities  primarily money market and time deposits  and a decrease in net interest margin 
the western sierra merger  which was completed on june   contributed to the increase in interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the fair value of interest earning assets acquired on that date totaled billion  and interest bearing liabilities totaled billion 
the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets on a fully tax equivalent basis was for  a decrease of basis points as compared to this decrease is primarily due to increases in short term market rates which led to an increase in deposit and borrowing costs 
the increased yield on interest earning assets of basis points in  was more than offset by a corresponding increase in our cost of interest earning assets which increased by basis points in our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in volume  as well as changes in the yields earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds  or rates

these mortgage related securities provide yield spread to us treasury or agency securities  however  the cash flows arising from them can be volatile due to refinancing of the underlying mortgage loans 
the structure of most of the mortgage related securities provides for minimal extension risk in the event of increased market rates 
equity securities in other investment securities in the table above at december  consisted principally of investments in two mutual funds comprised largely of mortgage related securities  although the funds may also invest in us government or agency securities  bank certificates of deposit insured by the fdic or repurchase agreements

the bank s credit quality group is charged with monitoring asset quality  establishing credit policies and procedures and enforcing the consistent application of these policies and procedures across the bank 
the provision for loan and lease losses charged to earnings is based upon management s judgment of the amount necessary to maintain the allowance at a level adequate to absorb probable incurred losses 
the amount of provision charge is dependent upon many factors  including loan growth  net charge offs  changes in the composition of the loan portfolio  delinquencies  management s assessment of loan portfolio quality  general economic conditions that can impact the value of collateral  and other trends 
the evaluation of these factors is performed through an analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses 
reviews of non performing  past due loans and larger credits  designed to identify potential charges to the allowance for loan and lease losses  and to determine the adequacy of the allowance  are conducted on a quarterly basis 
these reviews consider such factors as the financial strength of borrowers  the value of the applicable collateral  loan loss experience  estimated loan losses  growth in the loan portfolio  prevailing economic conditions and other factors 
the process for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses was modified during in connection with the humboldt acquisition

in addition  bank regulatory authorities  as part of their periodic examination of the bank  may require additional charges to the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods if warranted as a result of their review 
mortgage servicing rights the following table presents the key elements of our mortgage servicing rights asset as of december   and summary of mortgage servicing rights years ended december  in thousands balance  beginning of year additions for new mortgage servicing rights capitalized amortization of servicing rights impairment charge recovery balance  end of year balance of loans serviced for others msr as a percentage of serviced loans as of december   we serviced residential mortgage loans for others with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of million for which servicing assets have been recorded 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  the servicing asset recorded at the time of sale is amortized over the term of  and in proportion to  net servicing revenues 

table of contents our servicing portfolio is segmented for purposes of determining impairment 
to the extent the fair value for any segment is less than the carrying value  an impairment reserve is recorded

historically low market rates can cause prepayments to increase as a result of refinancing activity 
to the extent loans are prepaid sooner than estimated at the time servicing assets are originally recorded  it is possible that certain mortgage servicing rights assets may become impaired to the extent that the fair value is less than carrying value net of any previously recorded amortization or valuation reserves 
generally  the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall 
at december   we had a valuation reserve of million based on the estimated fair value of the servicing portfolio 
the valuation reserve is adjusted on a quarterly basis through adjustments to mortgage banking revenue 
goodwill and core deposit intangible assets at december   we had goodwill and core deposit intangibles of million and million  respectively  as compared to million and million  respectively  at year end this increase in goodwill and core deposit intangibles is principally attributed to the western sierra acquisition 
the goodwill recorded in connection with the western sierra acquisition represented the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired 
a portion of the purchase price was allocated to the value of western sierra s core deposits  which included all deposits except certificates of deposit 
the value of the core deposits was determined by a third party based on an analysis of the cost differential between the core deposits and alternative funding sources 
we amortize core deposit intangible assets on an accelerated or straight line basis over an estimated ten year life 
substantially all of the goodwill is associated with our community banking operations 
we evaluate goodwill for possible impairment on a quarterly basis and there were no impairments recorded for the years ended december   or additional information regarding our accounting for goodwill and core deposit intangible assets is included in notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
deposits total deposits were billion at december   an increase of billion  or  from the prior year end 
this growth is due to the acquisition of billion of deposits through the western sierra acquisition and organic growth resulting from our unique delivery process  service quality focus  marketing and product design 
information on average deposit balances and average rates paid is included under the net interest income section of this report

additional information regarding securities sold under agreements to repurchase and federal funds purchased is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
at december   the bank had outstanding term debt of million 
advances from the federal home loan banks of san francisco and seattle fhlb amounted to million of the total and are secured by investment securities and residential mortgage loans 
the fhlb advances outstanding at december  had fixed interest rates ranging from to 
approximately million  or  of the fhlb advances mature prior to december  and another million  or  mature prior to december  management expects continued use of fhlb advances as a source of short and long term funding 
additional information regarding term debt is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
junior subordinated debentures we had junior subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million  respectively  at december  and the increase is due to the assumption of debentures originally issued by western sierra 
at december   approximately million  or of the total issued amount  had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over libor 
increases in short term market interest rates during have resulted in increased interest expense for junior subordinated debentures 
although any additional increases in short term market interest rates will increase the interest expense for junior subordinated debentures  we believe that other attributes of our balance sheet will serve to mitigate the impact to net interest income on a consolidated basis 
all of the debentures issued to the trusts  less the common stock of the trusts  qualified as tier capital as of december   under guidance issued by the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
additional information regarding the terms of the junior subordinated debentures  including maturity call dates and interest rates  is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 

table of contents liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the bank s ability to meet the day to day cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs 
we monitor the sources and uses of funds on a daily basis to maintain an acceptable liquidity position 
in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities  the bank can utilize established uncommitted federal funds lines of credit  sell securities under agreements to repurchase  borrow on a secured basis from the fhlb or issue brokered certificates of deposit 
at december   there was no outstanding balance of federal funds purchased 
this compared to an outstanding balance of federal funds purchased at december  of million at a rate of 
the bank had available lines of credit with the fhlb totaling billion at december  the bank had uncommitted federal funds line of credit agreements with additional financial institutions totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
availability of the lines is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued borrower eligibility 
these lines are intended to support short term liquidity needs  and the agreements restrict the consecutive day usage 
the company is a separate entity from the bank and must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of the company s revenues are obtained from dividends declared and paid by the bank 
in  the bank paid the company million in dividends 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company 
we believe that such restrictions will not have an adverse impact on the ability of the company to meet its ongoing cash obligations  which consist principally of debt service on the million issued amount of outstanding junior subordinated debentures 
as of december   the company did not have any borrowing arrangements of its own 
as disclosed in the consolidated statements of cash flows in item of this report  net cash provided by operating activities was million during the principal source of cash provided by operating activities was net income 
net cash of million used in investing activities consisted principally of million of net loan growth and purchases of million of investment securities available for sale  partially offset by sales and maturities of investment securities available for sale of million and net cash acquired in the western sierra merger of million 
the million of cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of million of net deposit growth  partially offset by financing outflows related to million decrease in fed funds purchased  million of net repayment of term loans and million payment of dividends

additional information about employee benefit plans is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
the table above does not include deposit liabilities  interest payments or purchase accounting adjustments related to term debt or junior subordinated debentures 

table of contents umpqua holdings corporation although we expect the bank s and the company s liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during  increases in market interest rates have resulted in increased competition for bank deposits 
it is possible that our deposit growth for may not be maintained at previous levels due to increased pricing pressure or  in order to generate deposit growth  our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits 
concentrations of credit risk information regarding concentrations of credit risk is included in notes  and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
capital resources shareholders equity at december  was billion  an increase of million  or  from december  the increase in shareholders equity during was principally due to stock issued in connection with the western sierra merger of million  the retention of million  or approximately  of net income for the year and issuance of common stock under stock plans and related tax benefit of million 
book value per share as of december  was and tangible book value total shareholders equity less intangible assets  divided by total shares outstanding per share was the federal reserve board has in place guidelines for risk based capital requirements applicable to us banks and bank financial holding companies 
these risk based capital guidelines take into consideration risk factors  as defined by regulation  associated with various categories of assets  both on and off balance sheet 
under the guidelines  capital strength is measured in two tiers  which are used in conjunction with risk adjusted assets to determine the risk based capital ratios 
the guidelines require an total risk based capital ratio  of which must be tier i capital 
our consolidated tier i capital  which consists of shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  totaled million at december  tier ii capital components include all  or a portion of  the allowance for loan and lease losses and the portion of trust preferred securities in excess of tier i statutory limits 
the total of tier i capital plus tier ii capital components is referred to as total risk based capital  and was million at december  the percentage ratios  as calculated under the guidelines  were and for tier i and total risk based capital  respectively  at december  a minimum leverage ratio is required in addition to the risk based capital standards and is defined as period end shareholders equity and qualifying trust preferred securities  less other comprehensive income  goodwill and deposit based intangibles  divided by average assets as adjusted for goodwill and other intangible assets 
although a minimum leverage ratio of is required for the highest rated financial holding companies that are not undertaking significant expansion programs  the federal reserve board may require a financial holding company to maintain a leverage ratio greater than if it is experiencing or anticipating significant growth or is operating with less than well diversified risks in the opinion of the federal reserve board 
the federal reserve board uses the leverage and risk based capital ratios to assess capital adequacy of banks and financial holding companies 
our consolidated leverage ratios at december  and were  and  respectively 
as of december   the most recent notification from the fdic categorized the bank as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
there are no conditions or events since that notification that management believes have changed the bank s regulatory capital category 
at december   all three of the capital ratios of the bank exceeded the minimum ratios required by federal regulation 
management monitors these ratios on a regular basis to ensure that the bank remains within regulatory guidelines 
further information regarding the actual and required capital ratios is provided in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item below 
during the third and fourth quarter of  umpqua s board of directors approved increasing the quarterly cash dividend rate to from per share in the first and second quarters of this increase was made pursuant to our existing dividend policy and in consideration of  among other things  earnings  regulatory capital levels and expected asset growth 
the payment of cash dividends is subject to regulatory limitations as described under the supervision and regulation section of part i of this report 
there is no assurance that future cash dividends will be declared or increased 
the following table presents cash dividends declared and dividend payout ratios dividends declared per share divided by basic earnings per share for the years ended december   and cash dividends and payout ratios dividend declared per share dividend payout ratio 
table of contents our board of directors has approved a stock repurchase plan for up to million shares of common stock 
as of december   a total of million shares remain available for repurchase under this authorization  which expires on june  in addition  our stock option plans provide for option holders to pay for the exercise price in part or whole by tendering previously held shares 
although no shares were repurchased in open market transactions during the fourth quarter of  we expect to continue to repurchase additional shares in the future 
the timing and amount of such repurchases will depend upon the market price for our common stock  securities laws restricting repurchases  asset growth  earnings and our capital plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the absolute level and volatility of interest rates can have a significant impact on our profitability 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to identify and manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changing interest rates to achieve our overall financial objectives 
based on economic conditions  asset quality and various other considerations  management establishes tolerance ranges for interest rate sensitivity and manages within these ranges 
net interest income and the fair value of financial instruments are greatly influenced by changes in the level of interest rates 
we manage exposure to fluctuations in interest rates through policies that are established by the asset liability management committee alco 
the alco meets monthly and has responsibility for developing asset liability management policy  formulating and implementing strategies to improve balance sheet positioning and earnings and reviewing interest rate sensitivity 
the board of directors loan and investment committee provides oversight of the asset liability management process  reviews the results of the interest rate risk analyses prepared for the alco and approves the asset liability policy on an annual basis 
management utilizes an interest rate simulation model to estimate the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
such estimates are based upon a number of assumptions for each scenario  including the level of balance sheet growth  deposit repricing characteristics and the rate of prepayments 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these repricing characteristics are the time frames within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity during the life of the instruments 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity structure of assets and liabilities and their repricing characteristics during periods of changes in market interest rates 
effective interest rate sensitivity management seeks to ensure that both assets and liabilities respond to changes in interest rates within an acceptable timeframe  thereby minimizing the impact of interest rate changes on net interest income 
interest rate sensitivity is measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities at a point in time that are subject to repricing at various time horizons immediate to three months  four to twelve months  one to five years  over five years  and on a cumulative basis 
the differences are known as interest sensitivity gaps 
the table below sets forth interest sensitivity gaps for these different intervals as of december  
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation interest sensitivity gap in thousands by repricing interval non rate months months years over years sensitive total assets temporary investments trading account assets securities available for sale securities held to maturity loans and loans held for sale non interest earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity interest bearing demand deposits savings and money market deposits time deposits securities sold under agreements to repurchase term debt junior subordinated debentures non interest bearing liabilities and shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative gap as a of earning assets changes in the mix of earning assets or supporting liabilities can either increase or decrease the net interest margin without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  the interest rate spread between an asset and its supporting liability can vary significantly  while the timing of repricing for both the asset and the liability remains the same  thus impacting net interest income 
this characteristic is referred to as basis risk and generally relates to the possibility that the repricing characteristics of short term assets tied to the prime rate are different from those of short term funding sources such as certificates of deposit 
varying interest rate environments can create unexpected changes in prepayment levels of assets and liabilities that are not reflected in the interest rate sensitivity analysis 
these prepayments may have a significant impact on our net interest margin 
because of these factors  an interest sensitivity gap analysis may not provide an accurate assessment of our exposure to changes in interest rates 
we utilize an interest rate simulation model to monitor and evaluate the impact of changing interest rates on net interest income 
the estimated impact on our net interest income over a time horizon of one year as of december  is indicated in the table below 
for the scenarios shown  the interest rate simulation assumes a parallel and sustained shift in market interest rates ratably over a twelve month period and no change in the composition or size of the balance sheet 
for example  the up basis points scenario is based on a theoretical increase in market rates of basis points per month for twelve months applied to the balance sheet of december for each respective year 

table of contents interest rate simulation impact on net interest income as of december  in thousands increase decrease increase decrease increase decrease in net interest in net interest in net interest income from percentage income from percentage income from percentage base scenario change base scenario change base scenario change up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points as of december  and  we believe our balance sheet was in an asset sensitive position  as the repricing characteristics were such that an increase in market interest rates would have a positive effect on net interest income and a decrease in market interest rates would have negative effect on net interest income 
the flattening yield curve and changed mix and pricing characteristics of our balance sheet in resulted in decreased asset sensitivity from the previous years 
at december   we are liability sensitive in three of four scenarios 
however  our overall sensitivity in all four scenarios has decreased as compared to prior years indicating a more neutral interest risk position 
some of the assumptions made in the simulation model may not materialize and unanticipated events and circumstances will occur 
in addition  the simulation model does not take into account any future actions which we could undertake to mitigate an adverse impact due to changes in interest rates from those expected  in the actual level of market interest rates or competitive influences on our deposit base 
a second interest rate sensitivity measure we utilize is the quantification of market value changes for all financial assets and liabilities  given an increase or decrease in market interest rates 
this approach provides a longer term view of interest rate risk  capturing all future expected cash flows 
assets and liabilities with option characteristics are measured based on different interest rate path valuations using statistical rate simulation techniques 
the table below illustrates the effects of various market interest rate changes on the fair values of financial assets and liabilities excluding mortgage servicing rights as compared to the corresponding carrying values and fair values interest rate simulation impact on fair value of financial assets and liabilities as of december  in thousands increase decrease in increase decrease in estimated fair percentage estimated fair percentage value of equity change value of equity change up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points consistent with the results in the interest rate simulation impact on net interest income  our overall sensitivity to market interest rate changes has declined as compared to 
table of contents umpqua holdings corporation impact of inflation and changing prices a financial institution s asset and liability structure is substantially different from that of an industrial firm in that primarily all assets and liabilities of a bank are monetary in nature  with relatively little investment in fixed assets or inventories 
inflation has an important impact on the growth of total assets and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain appropriate capital ratios 
we believe that the impact of inflation on financial results depends on management s ability to react to changes in interest rates and  by such reaction  reduce the inflationary impact on performance 
we have an asset liability management program which attempts to manage interest rate sensitivity 
in addition  periodic reviews of banking services and products are conducted to adjust pricing in view of current and expected costs 
our financial statements included in item below have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which requires us to measure financial position and operating results principally in terms of historic dollars 
changes in the relative value of money due to inflation or recession are generally not considered 
the primary effect of inflation on our results of operations is through increased operating costs  such as compensation  occupancy and business development expenses 
in management s opinion  changes in interest rates affect the financial condition of a financial institution to a far greater degree than changes in the rate of inflation 
although interest rates are greatly influenced by changes in the inflation rate  they do not necessarily change at the same rate or in the same magnitude as the inflation rate 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including us fiscal and monetary policy and general national and global economic conditions
