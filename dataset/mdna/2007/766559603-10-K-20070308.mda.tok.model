item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview rigel is a clinical stage drug development company that discovers and develops novel  small molecule drugs for the treatment of inflammatory diseases  cancer and viral diseases 
our goal is to file one new investigative new drug ind application in a significant indication each year 
we have achieved this goal each year since our pioneering research focuses on intracellular signaling pathways and related targets that are critical to disease mechanisms 
rigel s productivity has resulted in strategic collaborations with large pharmaceutical partners to develop and market our product candidates 
we have product development programs in inflammatory autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis  thrombocytopenia  and asthma and allergy  as well as in cancer 
rigel has multiple product candidates in development as follows r product candidate for rheumatoid arthritis ra 
r is our lead product candidate 
it has a novel mechanism of action blocking igg receptor signaling in macrophages and b cells 
previously  we studied r in a phase single center  double blind  randomized  placebo controlled trial evaluating the safety and pharmacokinetics of escalating single and multiple doses of r we completed r studies to evaluate its safety and pharmacokinetics in combination with methotrexate  a commonly prescribed treatment for ra 
results of this trial suggest no adverse interaction 
in september  we commenced a phase  multicenter  ascending dose  randomized  double blind  placebo controlled  dose ranging study to evaluate up to three doses of r in ra patients failing to respond to methotrexate 
we expect to receive results from the study in the second half of r product candidate for immune thombocytopenic purpura itp 
platelet destruction from itp is mediated by igg signaling 
r is a potent inhibitor of igg signaling 
in preclinical studies  r was shown to improve thrombocytopenia in an itp mouse model 
we commenced phase clinical trials of r to evaluate its safety and efficacy in refractory itp patients in january and expect to receive results from the study in the middle of r product candidate for b cell lymphoma 
research has shown that syk overactivity is an essential mechanism in several types of b cell lymphoma survival and that r inhibits the growth of b cell lymphoma driven by syk overactivity 
we filed an ind for this indication in december and plan to begin a clinical trial by the first half of r product candidate for oncology 
r is a potent  highly selective  small molecule inhibitor of aurora kinase targeting cancer cell proliferation 
in october  we signed a licensing agreement with merck serono that grants to merck serono an exclusive license to develop and commercialize inhibitors in our aurora kinase program  including r under the agreement  we were responsible for filing an ind for r  which we filed with the food and drug administration  or fda  in december  and were allowed to proceed under the ind in january merck serono is responsible for the further development and commercialization of r during february  we received a payment of million from merck serono triggered by the regulatory acceptance 
in september  we received a payment of million from merck serono triggered by merck serono s initiation of a phase trial for r this initial trial is a multicenter study on patients with refractory solid tumors 
in february  merck serono began an additional phase trial evaluating r in hematological malignancies 
in  we announced that we entered into a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer for the development of inhaled products for the treatment of allergic asthma and other respiratory diseases  such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  or copd 
the collaboration is focused on our preclinical small molecule compounds  which inhibit ige receptor signaling in respiratory tract mast cells by blocking the signaling enzyme syk  a novel drug target for respiratory diseases 
mast cells play important roles in both early and late phase allergic reactions  and syk inhibitors could prevent both phases 
in may  we achieved the first collaboration milestone when pfizer nominated r to commence advanced preclinical development in allergic asthma 
pfizer paid us million for the exclusive right to r  which is expected to be delivered using pfizer s dry powder inhaler and is expected to enter the clinic in in october  we announced that we selected r  an orally available  potent and selective inhibitor of jak to enter preclinical studies to support an ind application planned for we are also studying axl inhibition in oncology 
in addition to the aforementioned product candidates  we have ongoing research programs involving back up candidates for the product candidates above and drug discovery efforts in our immunology inflammation  virology and oncology programs 
corporate collaborations we carry on research and development programs in connection with our corporate collaborations 
as of december   we had collaborations with six major pharmaceutical biotech companies comprised of one with janssen pharmaceutica nv  a division of johnson johnson  relating to oncology therapeutics and diagnostics  two with pfizer inc  one initiated in and the other in  relating to intrapulmonary asthma and allergy therapeutics  one with novartis pharma ag with respect to four different programs relating to immunology  oncology and chronic bronchitis  one with daiichi pharmaceuticals co  ltd 
in the area of oncology  one with merck  in the area of oncology  and one with merck serono in the area of oncology 
all of these collaborations  excluding the recent pfizer and the merck serono collaborations  have a research phase during which we receive or received funding based on the level of headcount allocated to a program 
in all of these collaborations  if certain conditions are met  we are entitled to receive future milestone payments and royalties 
we cannot guarantee that these conditions will be met or that research and development efforts will be successful 
as a result  we may not receive any further milestone payments or royalties under these agreements 
only the merck program currently provides for regular research reimbursement payments 
we are exploring new opportunities with existing and potential collaborators 
our earliest partnerships focused on the early stages of drug discovery  specifically on target discovery and validation 
our collaborations with daiichi and recently with merck are both later stage  focusing on drug discovery and development 
our collaboration with pfizer covers a compound that pfizer selected for advanced preclinical development in may  while our collaboration with merck serono covers a compound that began clinical trials in september we currently anticipate that in order to support our current research programs  we will need to self fund our own research programs  which involves an increased rate of spending on later stages of development prior to partnering with collaborative partners 
therefore  it is expected that future collaborations may have an expanded focus and could include high throughput screening  combinatorial and medicinal chemistry  preclinical evaluations and or clinical development of compounds we have discovered 
in addition  we believe these future collaborations could be structured to consist of upfront payments  the purchase of our common stock  milestone payments upon meeting certain conditions  research or development reimbursement payments and or royalties upon commercialization of products resulting from the collaboration 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with u 
s generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates  including those related to terms of the research collaborations ie  amortization of upfront fees and certain milestones  investments  stock compensation  impairment issues  the estimated useful life of assets and contingencies  on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
in addition  we believe that there have been no significant changes in our critical accounting policies during the period ended december  as compared to those previously disclosed in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   except for the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment revised  or sfas r  for equity based compensation costs in january revenue recognition we recognize revenue from our contract arrangements 
our revenue arrangements with multiple elements are evaluated under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered element has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
the consideration we receive is allocated among the separate units based on their respective fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria is applied to each of the separate units 
advance payments received in excess of amounts earned are classified as deferred revenue until earned 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with research and development collaboration agreements  including technology access fees  are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods of continuing involvement  generally the research term 
when a research term is not specified  we estimate the time it will take us to complete our deliverables under the contract and recognize the upfront fee using the straight line method over that time period 
we review our estimates every quarter for reasonableness 
revenue related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators is recognized as research services are performed over the related development funding periods for each contract 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as specified in the applicable agreement 
the payments received are not refundable and are generally based on a contractual cost per full time equivalent employee working on the project 
research and development expenses under the collaborative research agreements  except for the merck collaboration signed in november related to ubiquitin ligases  approximate or exceed the revenue recognized under such agreements over the term of the respective agreements 
for the merck collaboration  we are recognizing a pro rata portion of the invoiced amounts for funding of our research scientists based on the headcount dedicated to the project 
it is our policy to recognize revenue based on our level of effort expended and that revenue recognized will not exceed amounts billable under the arrangement 
revenue associated with at risk milestones pursuant to collaborative agreements is recognized based upon the achievement of the milestones as set forth in the applicable agreement 
royalties will be recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when the third party results are reliably measurable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
stock based compensation years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands stock based compensation recovery expense from officer  director and employee options consultant options re priced options total we grant options to purchase our common stock to our officers  directors and all other employees and consultants under our stock option plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of our common stock at a price per share equal to the lesser of of the fair market value on the first day of the offering period or of the fair market value on the purchase date under our employee stock purchase plan  or espp 
the benefits provided under these plans are share based payments subject to the provisions of sfas r 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r using the modified prospective application transition method 
under this method  the share based compensation cost recognized beginning january  includes compensation cost for i all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value originally estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  or sfas  and calculated for pro forma disclosures under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  or sfas  and ii all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r and staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab compensation cost under sfas r for awards granted prior to january  is recognized using an accelerated method pursuant to the fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans  or fin for awards granted after january   we have adopted the use of the straight line attribution method over the requisite service period for the entire award 
results of prior periods do not reflect any restated amounts  and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was insignificant upon adoption of sfas no 
r under the modified prospective method 
in addition pursuant to sfas r  we are required to estimate the amount of expected forfeitures when calculating compensation costs  instead of accounting for forfeitures as incurred  which was our previous method 
we will record actual forfeitures as they occur  and we will review our forfeiture rates each quarter and make any necessary changes to our estimates 
prior to adopting sfas r on january   we accounted for equity based employee compensation costs under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb under apb  the intrinsic value method of accounting  no compensation expense is recognized  because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
pro forma information regarding net loss and net loss per share was determined as if we had accounted for issuances under our stock option plans and espp under the fair value method prescribed by sfas  as amended by sfas the fair value for these options was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
in  we recorded charges associated with the stock options that were eligible for re pricing under a tender offer initiated in june all replacement options  as well as the eligible options that were not surrendered under the original offer to exchange  were treated for financial reporting purposes as variable awards 
therefore  for the period prior to adoption of sfas r  we recorded non cash charges  generally for the intrinsic value of the options as they vested  utilizing the accelerated vesting method  reflecting increases and decreases down to  but not below  the exercise price in the price of our common stock as compensation expense recovery in connection with the replacement options and the eligible options that were not exchanged 
for the year ended december   we recorded non cash compensation recovery of approximately million related to all options eligible for the replacement 
the recovery resulted from the decrease in the market price of our common stock during for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash compensation charge of million related to all options eligible for the replacement 
the expense was attributable to the increase in the market price of our common stock during for periods after the adoption of sfas r  we continued to account for these repriced options in accordance with provisions of sfas in august  our board of directors granted new options to employees  non employee directors and consultants who held repriced options that had expired in august we granted options to purchase approximately  shares of common stock with an exercise price of per share 
the options vested at the date of the grant and the remaining will vest monthly over two years 
we recorded stock based compensation expense of approximately  relating to these newly granted options for the year ended december  we also record charges associated with options granted to consultants reflecting the fair value valuation and periodic fair value remeasurement of outstanding consultant options under emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services  or eitf the valuation is based upon the current market value of our common stock and other assumptions  including the expected future volatility of our stock price  risk free interest rate and expected term 
for consultant options granted in  we amortize stock based compensation using a straight line attribution method consistent with the method used for employees and with the attribution election we made upon adoption of sfas r 
for options granted prior to january   we use the accelerated method for expensing stock based compensation  which was the method we used prior to adoption 
we expect to see continued fluctuations in the future as a portion of these options are remeasured based on the changes in the current market price of our common stock 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
therefore  we believe it is important to be aware of the high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas r 
the guidance in and application of sfas r and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulleting no 
 or sab  may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we may adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
results of operations years ended december   and revenues years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands contract revenues from collaborations revenues by collaborator were years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands merck serono pfizer merck daiichi novartis total contract revenues from collaborations in and consisted primarily of amortization of upfront fees  milestone payments and research support from the continuation of our current collaborations 
contract revenues from collaborations in consisted primarily of amortization of upfront fees and research support 
the increase in revenues in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily due to the recognition of the merck serono milestone payments totaling million  the full amortization of the merck serono upfront payment of million and the recognition of the pfizer milestone payment of million offset by the termination of the daiichi collaboration in the increase in revenues in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily due to a full year of merck collaboration and the initiation of the pfizer and merck serono collaborations offset by the termination of the research phase of the novartis oncology program in we have deferred a total of approximately  of research reimbursement revenue from merck in order to account for the headcount effort expended by us for the time period invoiced  which covers the relevant periods from the initiation of the collaboration in through december  we expect contract revenues from collaborations to continue to be a significant component of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
research and development years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands research and development expenses stock based compensation expense recovery included in research and development expenses the increase in research and development expenses in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily attributable to an increase in stock based compensation expense upon the adoption of sfas r as previously discussed under critical accounting policies and the use of estimates stock based compensation  offset by a decrease in preclinical and clinical costs 
the decrease in our preclinical and clinical costs in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily due to the termination of the r and r programs in and the transfer of sponsorship relating to r to merck serono in  offset by increased costs relating to our r program  which initiated a phase trial in august the increase in research and development expenses in  as compared to the similar period in  was due to the increase in our preclinical and clinical costs and personnel costs offset by a decrease in stock based compensation expense related to the repriced stock options as discussed under critical accounting policies and the use of estimates stock based compensation 
the increase in preclinical and clinical costs and personnel costs in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily due to costs associated with our r  r and r programs  offset by the decrease in costs associated with our r program  which was discontinued in july we expect that our research and development expenses will increase as we continue our phase trials of r in ra and itp  commence our phase trial of r in lymphoma and continue to work on programs for other indications 
the scope and magnitude of future research and development expenses are difficult to predict at this time given the number of studies that will need to be conducted for any of our potential products  as well as our limited capital resources 
in general  biopharmaceutical development involves a series of steps beginning with identification of a potential target and including  among others  proof of concept in animals and phase  and clinical studies in humans each of which is typically more expensive than the previous step 
success in development therefore results in increasing expenditures 
our research and development expenditures currently include costs for scientific personnel  supplies  equipment  consultants  sponsored research  allocated facility costs  costs related to preclinical and clinical trials  and stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands general and administrative expenses stock based compensation expense recovery included in general and administrative expenses the increase in general and administrative expenses in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense upon the adoption of sfas r as discussed under critical accounting policies and the use of estimates stock based compensation and increased personnel and facility costs 
the decrease in administrative expenses in  as compared to the similar period in  was primarily due to the decrease in stock based compensation expense related to the repriced stock options as discussed under critical accounting policies and the use of estimates stock based compensation  offset by increased personnel and facility costs 
loss on disposal sale of property and equipment years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands loss on disposal sale of property and equipment during  we wrote off  of assets at their original acquisition cost and related accumulated depreciation of  for assets that were no longer in use 
we recorded a loss on disposal of property and equipment of  interest income years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands interest income interest income results from our interest bearing cash and investment balances 
the increases in interest income in  as compared to the similar periods in and  were primarily due to the increase in our investment balances as a result of the public offering we completed in july where we raised million in net proceeds combined with an increase in the interest rates we earned on these balances 
interest expense years ended december  aggregate change from from in thousands interest expense interest expense is the result of our capital lease obligations associated with fixed asset acquisitions 
interest expense was flat in  and due to comparable debt obligations outstanding during those years 
future accounting requirements in july  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin this interpretation requires that we recognize in our financial statements  the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained in an audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our financial statements 
in september  the sec released sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab sab provides interpretive guidance on the sec s views regarding the process of quantifying materiality of financial statement misstatements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november  we adopted sab for the year ended december  in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  or sfas this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting priniciples  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements we have financed our operations from inception primarily through sales of equity securities  contract payments payable to us under our collaboration agreements and equipment financing arrangements 
we have consumed substantial amounts of capital to date  and operating expenditures are expected to increase over the next several years 
during  we received payments of approximately million from our collaborations with merck serono  pfizer and merck 
we believe that our existing capital resources and anticipated proceeds from current collaborations will be sufficient to support our current operating plan through at least the next months 
our operations will require significant additional funding  in large part due to our research and development expenses  future preclinical and clinical testing costs and the absence of any meaningful revenues for the foreseeable future 
the amount of future funds needed will depend largely on the timing and structure of potential future collaborations 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
to the extent we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities  our stockholders could at that time experience substantial dilution 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  we may be required to relinquish some rights to our technologies or product candidates  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
our future funding requirements will depend on many uncertain factors 
our future funding requirements will depend upon many factors  including  but not limited to the progress and success of clinical trials and preclinical activities including studies and manufacture of materials of our product candidates conducted by us or our collaborative partners or licensees  our ability to establish new collaborations and to maintain our existing collaboration partnerships  the progress of research programs carried out by us  any changes in the breadth of our research and development programs  our ability to meet the milestones identified in our collaborative agreements that trigger payments  the progress of the research and development efforts of our collaborative partners  our ability to acquire or license other technologies or compounds that we seek to pursue  our ability to manage our growth  competing technological and market developments  the costs and timing of obtaining  enforcing and defending our patent and intellectual rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals and filings by us and our collaborators  and expenses associated with unforeseen litigation 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research or development programs  to lose rights under existing licenses or to relinquish greater or all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or on less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and available for sale securities  as compared to million as of december   a decrease of million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to operating spending in the period  offset by collaboration proceeds of million 
we also received approximately million from the issuance of our common stock resulting from our stock option plans and espp and approximately million under our equipment financing arrangements 
for the years ended december  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  federal agency securities  and corporate bonds and notes 
cash in excess of immediate requirements is invested with regard to liquidity and capital preservation 
wherever possible  we seek to minimize the potential effects of concentration and degrees of risk 
contractual obligations the following are our contractual commitments by fiscal year as of december  associated with debt obligations  contracted research obligations  and lease obligations in thousands total less than year years years more than years in thousands debt obligations contracted research facilities lease  net of sublease total as of december   we had million in debt obligations associated with our equipment additions 
all existing debt agreements as of december  are secured by the equipment financed  bear interest at rates in a range of to and are due in monthly installments through during may  we initiated a sublease of approximately  square feet of our premises to a tenant for a period of two years 
the sublease was amended in september to extend term for an additional year 
the facilities lease obligations above are reflective of the sublease income stream of approximately the payments above also reflect the remaining twelve years of the lease term 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the market value amount of our investment will decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and available for sale securities in a variety of securities  including money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in  and  we maintained an investment portfolio primarily in money market funds  federal agency securities  and corporate bonds and notes 
due to the primarily short term nature of these investments  we believe we do not have a material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosure is provided 
we have operated primarily in the united states  and all funding activities with our collaborators to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations
