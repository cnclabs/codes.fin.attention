this annual report may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause such a difference include  but are not limited to  those discussed in risk factors 
overview we are an information technology consulting firm serving global and large enterprise companies throughout the united states and canada 
we help clients gain competitive advantage by using internet based technologies to make their businesses more responsive to market opportunities and threats  strengthen relationships with customers  suppliers and partners  improve productivity and reduce information technology costs 
our solutions enable these benefits by integrating  automating and extending business processes  technology infrastructure and software applications end to end within an organization and with key partners  suppliers and customers 
this provides real time access to critical business applications and information and a scalable  reliable  secure and cost effective technology infrastructure 
services revenues services revenues are derived from professional services performed developing  implementing  integrating  automating and extending business processes  technology infrastructure and software applications 
most of our projects are performed on a time and materials basis  and a smaller amount of revenues is derived from projects performed on a fixed fee basis 
fixed fee engagements represented approximately of our services revenues for the year ended december  for time and material projects  revenues is recognized and billed by multiplying the number of hours our professionals expend in the performance of the project by the established billing rates 
for fixed fee projects  revenues are generally recognized using the proportionate performance method 
revenues on uncompleted projects are recognized on a contract by contract basis in the period in which the portion of the fixed fee is complete 
amounts invoiced to clients in excess of revenues recognized are classified as deferred revenues 
the company s average bill rates increased slightly in the company is anticipating modest additional increases in on most projects  we are also reimbursed for out of pocket expenses such as airfare  lodging and meals 
these reimbursements are included as a component of revenues 
the aggregate amount of reimbursed expenses will fluctuate depending on the location of our customers  the total number of our projects that require travel  and whether our arrangements with our clients provide for the reimbursement of travel and other project related expenses 
software revenues software revenues are derived from sales of third party software 
revenues from sales of third party software are recorded on a gross basis provided we act as a principal in the transaction 
in the event we do not meet the requirements to be considered a principal in the software sale transaction and act as an agent  the revenues are recorded on a net basis 
software revenues are expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on our customers demand for software products 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists primarily of cash and non cash compensation and benefits associated with our technology professionals and subcontractors 
non cash compensation includes stock compensation expenses arising from restricted stock and option grants to employees 
cost of revenues also includes third party software costs  reimbursable expenses and other unreimbursed project related expenses 
project related expenses will fluctuate generally depending on outside factors including the cost and frequency of travel and the location of our customers 
cost of revenues does not include depreciation of assets used in the production of revenues 
gross margins our gross margins for services are affected by the utilization rates of our professionals  defined as the percentage of our professionals time billed to customers divided by the total available hours in the respective period  the salaries we pay our consulting professionals and the average billing rate we receive from our customers 
if a project ends earlier than scheduled or we retain professionals in advance of receiving project assignments  or if demand for our services declines  our utilization rate will decline and adversely affect our gross margins 
subject to fluctuations resulting from our acquisitions  we expect these key metrics of our services business to remain relatively constant for the foreseeable future assuming there are no further declines in the demand for information technology software and services 
gross margin percentages of third party software sales are typically lower than gross margin percentages for services and the mix of services and software for a particular period can significantly impact total combined gross margin percentage for such period 
in addition  gross margin for software sales can fluctuate due to pricing and other competitive pressures 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a consist of salaries  bonuses  non cash compensation  office costs  recruiting  professional fees  sales and marketing activities  training  and other miscellaneous expenses 
non cash compensation includes stock compensation expenses related to restricted stock and option grants to employees and non employee directors 
we work to minimize selling costs by focusing on repeat business with existing customers and by accessing sales leads generated by our software business partners  most notably ibm  whose products we use to design and implement solutions for our clients 
these partnerships enable us to reduce our selling costs and sales cycle times and increase win rates through leveraging our partners marketing efforts and endorsements 
a substantial portion of our sg a costs are relatively fixed 
as a result  we expect sg a costs as a percentage of revenue to decline as we continue to increase revenues in plans for growth and acquisitions our goal is to continue to build one of the leading independent information technology consulting firms in north america by expanding our relationships with existing and new clients  leveraging our operations to expand nationally and continuing to make disciplined acquisitions 
we believe the united states represents an attractive market for growth  primarily through acquisitions 
as demand for our services grows  we believe we will attempt to increase the number of professionals in our north american offices and to add new offices throughout the united states  both organically and through acquisitions 
in addition  we believe our track record for identifying acquisitions and our ability to integrate acquired businesses helps us complete acquisitions efficiently and productively  while continuing to offer quality services to our clients  including new clients resulting from the acquisitions

gross margin increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  gross margin as a percentage of total revenues increased to in from in the increase in gross margin as a percentage of total revenues is due to a mix of improved software margins off set by lower services margins 
services gross margin decreased slightly to in from in primarily due to lower gross margins on consulting services contracts acquired in the acquisitions of zettaworks and ipath 
these businesses are national practices rather than local practices and  as a result  they incur a greater amount of unreimbursed travel expenses for delivery of services outside of their local geographic market 
unreimbursed expenses negatively impact our services gross margins 
services gross margins have also been impacted by the acquisition of vivare which has slightly lower services gross margins than our historical average 
software gross margin increased to in from in primarily as a result of fluctuations in selling prices to customers based on fluctuations in vendor pricing based on market conditions at the time of the sales and from the sale of internally developed software representing software revenues of approximately  for which there was no associated cost of revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due primarily to increases in the cost of compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of  professional service fees associated with external audits  and additions of sales personnel  management personnel  support personnel and facilities related to the acquisitions of ipath and vivare in and the full year impact of the acquisitions of genisys  meritage and zettaworks in however  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of services revenues is the result of operational efficiencies and economies of scale as the company has grown

intangibles amortization expenses  arising from acquisitions  increased to approximately million for the year ended december  from approximately million for the year ended december  the increase in amortization expense is the result of increased acquisition activity 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to approximately  for the year ended december  compared to approximately  during the year ended december  this increase in interest expense is due to the interest expense related to the acquisition line of credit which was drawn down in connection with the acquisitions of meritage in june and zettaworks in december  and on draws on the accounts receivable line of credit in connection with the acquisitions of ipath and vivare 
as of december   there was approximately million outstanding on the acquisition line of credit and approximately million outstanding on the accounts receivable line of credit 
during  we drew down million on the accounts receivable line of credit and repaid million 
provision for income taxes 
we accrue a provision for federal  state and foreign income tax at the applicable statutory rates adjusted for non deductible expenses 
our effective tax rate decreased slightly to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in certain non deductible expenses 
we had deferred tax assets resulting from net operating and capital losses of acquired companies amounting to approximately million for which we had a valuation allowance of approximately million 
we had additional deferred tax assets of approximately million from temporary differences between book and tax valuations 
these combined deferred tax assets of million were off set by deferred tax liabilities of million related to identifiable intangibles  goodwill  and cash to accrual adjustments 
any reversal of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets will be adjusted against goodwill and will not have an impact on our statement of operations 
all of the net operating and capital losses relate to acquired entities  and as such are subject to annual limitations on usage under the change in control provisions of the internal revenues code 
liquidity and capital resources selected measures of liquidity and capital resources are as follows in millions as of december  cash and cash equivalents working capital net cash provided by operating activities we expect to fund our operations from cash generated from operations and short term borrowings as necessary from our credit facility 
we believe that these capital resources will be sufficient to meet our needs for at least the next twelve months 
net cash generated by operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the year ended december  the primary components of operating cash flows for the year ended december  were net income after adding back non cash expenses of million offset by increases to accounts receivable of million and decreases to other liabilities of million 
the increase in operating cash flow is due primarily to an increase in non cash stock compensation of million and intangibles amortization of million 
the increase in accounts receivable is primarily related to acquisitions 
no significant changes occurred in the average days sales outstanding 
net cash used in investing activities for the year ended december   we used approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  to acquire bay street  insolexen  and egg

borrowings under this acquisition line of credit bear interest equal to the four year us treasury note yield plus based on the spot rate on the day the draw is processed at december  
borrowings under this acquisition line are repayable in thirty six equal monthly installments  after the initial interest only period which continues through june  draws under this acquisition line may be made through june  we currently have million of available borrowing capacity under this acquisition line of credit 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility and we expect to be in compliance during the next twelve months 
substantially all of our assets are pledged to secure the credit facility 
there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of our business in lease obligations or other contractual obligations in we believe that the current available funds  access to capital from our credit facilities  possible capital from registered placements of equity through the shelf registration  and cash flows generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements and meet our capital needs to finance acquisitions for the next twelve months 
we have filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission to allow for offers and sales of our common stock from time to time 
approximately million shares of common stock may be sold under this registration statement if we choose to do so 
contractual obligations in connection with certain of our acquisitions  we were required to establish various letters of credit totaling  to serve as collateral to secure facility leases 
the letters of credit reduce the borrowings available under our accounts receivable line of credit 
in january  the letters of credit decreased  in connection with the acquisition of javelin  we issued million in notes  which have been fully repaid since april we have incurred commitments to make future payments under contracts such as leases and certain long term liabilities

if our capital is insufficient to fund our activities in either the short or long term  we may need to raise additional funds 
in the ordinary course of business  we may engage in discussions with various persons in connection with additional financing 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders percentage ownership will be diluted 
these equity securities may also have rights superior to our common stock 
additional debt or equity financing may not be available when needed or on satisfactory terms 
if adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to expand our services  respond to competition  pursue acquisition opportunities or continue our operations 
subsequent event on february   the company consummated the acquisition of e tech solutions 
the company paid approximately million consisting of approximately million in cash and million worth of the company s common stock  subject to certain post closing adjustments 
as required  we will use the closing price of the company s common stock at or near the close date in reporting the value of the stock consideration paid in the acquisition  which was 
the company issued  shares of its common stock in connection with the acquisition 
critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts  accounting for goodwill and intangible assets  purchase accounting allocation  accounting for stock based compensation  deferred income taxes and estimating the related valuation allowances 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts consulting revenues are comprised of revenues from professional services fees recognized primarily on a time and materials basis as performed 
for fixed fee engagements  revenues is recognized using the proportionate performance method based on the ratio of hours expended to total estimated hours 
revenues on uncompleted projects are recognized on a contract by contract basis in the period in which the portion of the fixed fee is complete 
billings in excess of costs plus earnings are classified as deferred revenues 
our normal payment terms are net days 
reimbursements for out of pocket expenses are included in gross revenues 
revenues from the sale of third party software are recorded on a gross basis provided that we act as the principal in the transaction 
in the event we do not meet the requirements to be considered the principal in the software sale transaction  we record the revenues on a net basis 
there is no effect on net income between recording the software sales on a gross basis versus a net basis 
revenues are recognized when the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of the customer arrangement exists  fees are fixed and determinable  delivery and acceptance has occurred  and collectibility is deemed probable 
we consider a non cancelable fully executed agreement or client purchase order to be persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to have occurred upon the rendering of services or delivery of software to the client 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable if the fee is not subject to adjustment  or if we have not granted extended payment terms to the client 
we consider collection to be probable if our internal credit analysis indicates that the client will be able to pay amounts as they become due under the arrangement 
for our sales arrangements that contain multiple revenue elements  such as software licenses  professional services and software maintenance  we first determine whether the arrangement is within the scope of emerging issues task force eitf eitf no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables or statement of position sop sop  software revenue recognition 
under eitf  separate contracts to provide services or for the sale of software to the same client must be evaluated as a multiple element arrangement if they are entered into in the same time frame 
we recognize revenue on arrangements with multiple deliverables as separate units of accounting only if certain criteria are met 
in general  a deliverable meets the separation criteria if the deliverable has standalone value to the client and if there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of all remaining undelivered elements in the arrangement 
we allocate the total arrangement consideration to each separate unit of accounting based on the relative fair value of each separate unit of accounting 
the amount of arrangement consideration that is allocated to a delivered unit of accounting is limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of another separate unit of accounting 
all deliverables of the company s multiple element arrangements meet these criteria 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines  discussed above  in determining revenues  however  certain judgments and estimates are made and used to determine revenues recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of revenues recognized for any period if different conditions were to prevail 
revenues from internally developed software are allocated to maintenance and support and are recognized ratably over the maintenance term typically one year 
revenues allocated to training and consulting service elements is recognized as the services are performed 
our consulting services are not essential to the functionality of our products as such services are available from other vendors 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon specific identification of likely and probable losses 
each accounting period  we evaluate accounts receivable for risk associated with a client s inability to make contractual payments or unresolved issues with the adequacy of our services 
billed and unbilled receivables that are specifically identified as being at risk are provided for with a charge to revenue in the period the risk is identified 
we use considerable judgment in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including reviewing the financial stability of the client  evaluating the successful mitigation of service delivery disputes  and gauging current market conditions 
if our evaluation of service delivery issues or a client s ability to pay is incorrect  we may incur future reductions to revenue 
goodwill  other intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets  and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future 
the determination of the value of such intangible assets requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements 
the company follows statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we assess our goodwill on october of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators and future cash flows related to intangible assets are based on operational performance of the businesses  market conditions and other factors 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill is impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have an adverse impact on our results of operations by decreasing net income 
management assessed goodwill for impairment at october  this analysis indicated that there was no impairment of the carrying values of goodwill 
we evaluate long lived tangible assets and intangible assets other than goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets held and used are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their net book value may not be entirely recoverable 
when such factors and circumstances exist  we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the related asset or group of assets over their estimated useful lives against their respective carrying amounts 
impairment  if any  is based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination was made 
purchase price allocation we allocate the purchase price of our acquisitions to the assets and liabilities acquired  including identifiable intangible assets  based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition 
some of the items  including accounts receivable  property and equipment  other intangible assets  certain accrued liabilities  and other reserves require a high degree of management judgment 
certain estimates may change as additional information becomes available 
goodwill is assigned at the enterprise level and is deductible for tax purposes for certain types of acquisitions 
the purchase price is allocated to intangibles based on management s estimate and an independent valuation 
management finalizes the purchase price allocation within twelve months of the acquisition date as certain initial accounting estimates are resolved 
accounting for stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  on january   using the modified prospective application transition method 
sfas no 
r requires that the costs of employee share based payments be measured at fair value on the awards grant date and recognized in the financial statements over the requisite service period 
the company estimates the fair value of stock option awards on the date of grant utilizing a modified black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of short term traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
however  certain assumptions used in the black scholes model  such as expected term  can be adjusted to incorporate the unique characteristics of the company s stock option awards 
option valuation models require the input of somewhat subjective assumptions including expected stock price volatility and expected term 
the company believes it is unlikely that materially different estimates for the assumptions used in estimating the fair value of stock options granted would be made based on the conditions suggested by actual historical experience and other data available at the time estimates were made 
restricted stock awards are valued at the price of our common stock on the date of the grant 
prior to january   the company accounted for share based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and elected the disclosure option of sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
required that companies either recognize compensation expense for grants of stock  stock options and other equity instruments based on fair value  or provide pro forma disclosure of net income and earnings per share in the notes to the financial statements 
accordingly  the company measured compensation expense for stock options as the excess  if any  of the estimated fair market value of the company s stock at the date of grant over the exercise price 
the company provided pro forma effects of this measurement in a footnote to its financial statements 
income taxes to record income tax expense  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
in addition  income tax expense at interim reporting dates requires us to estimate our expected effective tax rate for the entire year 
this involves estimating our actual current tax liability together with assessing temporary differences that result in deferred tax assets and liabilities and expected future tax rates 
management believes that our net deferred tax asset should continue to be reduced by a valuation allowance to an amount we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
future operating results and projections could alter this conclusion  potentially resulting in an increase or decrease in the valuation allowance 
since the valuation allowance relates solely to net operating and capital losses from acquired companies which are subject to usage limitations  any decrease in the valuation allowance will be applied first to reduce goodwill and then to reduce other acquisition related non current intangible assets to zero 
any remaining decrease in the valuation allowance would be recognized as a reduction of income tax expense 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab  which expresses the staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
the bulletin was effective at fiscal year end the implementation of this bulletin had no impact on the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas will be applied prospectively and will be effective for periods beginning after november  the company is currently evaluating the effect  if any  of sfas on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  treatment of interest and penalties  and disclosure of such positions 
fin will be applied prospectively and will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company will adopt the provisions of fin in the first quarter of as required 
the adoption of fin is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the eitf ratified eitf issue  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of presenting taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis 
an entity should disclose its policy of presenting taxes and the amount of any taxes presented on a gross basis should be disclosed  if significant 
the guidance is effective for periods beginning after december  we present revenues net of taxes 
eitf will not impact the method for recording these sales taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements the company currently has no off balance sheet arrangements  except operating lease commitments as disclosed in footnote to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we believe our exposure to market risks is immaterial 
exchange rate sensitivity during  million of our total revenues was attributable to our canadian operations 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency rates primarily arises from short term intercompany transactions with our canadian subsidiary and from client receivables in the canadian dollar 
our canadian subsidiary incurs a significant portion of its expenses in canadian dollars as well  which helps minimize our risk of exchange rate fluctuations 
based on the amount of revenues attributed to canada during  this exchange rate risk will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
interest rate sensitivity as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable line of credit and million of available borrowing capacity  excluding  reserved for two outstanding letters of credit to secure facility leases 
our interest expense will fluctuate as the interest rate for this accounts receivable line of credit floats based on the bank s prime rate 
the interest rate on the acquisition line of credit is fixed 
since there were no amounts outstanding under the accounts receivable line of credit as of december   an increase in the interest rate of basis points would add no interest expense per year 
we had unrestricted cash and cash equivalents totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
these amounts were invested primarily in money market funds 
the unrestricted cash and cash equivalents are held for working capital purposes 
we do not enter into investments for trading or speculative purposes 
due to the short term nature of these investments  we believe that we do not have any material exposure to changes in the fair value of our investment portfolio as a result of changes in interest rates 
declines in interest rates  however  will reduce future investment income
