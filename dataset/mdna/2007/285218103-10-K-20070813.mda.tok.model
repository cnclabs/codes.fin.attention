item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
information appearing under the above caption in our annual report is hereby incorporated by reference 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
historically  our primary market risk exposure has been risks related to interest rate fluctuations  primarily related to our previous borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility 
while we have the ability to draw on our revolving credit line  we had no borrowings under this credit facility on may  
table of contents instead  our financial results reflect the effect of changes in interest rates on our leasing yields 
our leasing yields generally directly correlate with market interest rates when interest rates are higher  our leasing terms incorporate a higher financing charge 
however  in times of relatively lower interest rates our financing charges also decrease  and some of our customers choose to purchase new equipment  rather than leasing equipment at all 
lower leasing yields are reflected in lower rental and lease revenues 
as of may   our cash and cash equivalents included money market securities  and we had investments in marketable securities 
due to the short term duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our portfolio 
we have wholly owned chinese and european subsidiaries 
our international operations subject us to foreign currency risks ie  the possibility that the financial results could be better or worse than planned because of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
currently  we do not use derivative instruments to hedge our economic exposure with respect to assets  liabilities and firm commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in fiscal  we experienced minimal impact on net income due to foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
although there can be no assurances  given the extent of our international operations  we do not expect future foreign exchange gains and losses to be significant 
we have no derivative financial instruments that expose us to significant market risk
