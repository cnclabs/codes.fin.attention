item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a specialty biopharmaceutical company with expertise in identifying and acquiring promising drug candidates and in designing and managing late stage clinical trials for central nervous system conditions 
below is an overview of the material developments and trends that affected our results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented 
viprinex development activity 
following our acquisition of empire in july  we established facilities and operations in new jersey  where the empire development team had been located  and we commenced planning for two phase clinical trials designed to enable us to seek regulatory approval for viprinex 
commencing in early  we contracted to procure a clinical supply of viprinex and  in addition to our clinical management team and clinical research assistants  or cras  engaged clinical research organizations  or cros  to oversee our trials 
we enrolled our first patient in the first trial near the end of and have expanded the clinical trials since that time with the inclusion of additional sites and countries to enhance trial enrollment 
these activities have resulted in a significant increase in our research and development expenses since fiscal  during which time we have spent approximately million on the development of viprinex 
we expect to complete enrollment in both asp trials by the end of the first quarter of if these trials are successful  we expect to be able to file for regulatory approval by the end of the first quarter of we expect that our development expenses will continue to increase as the number of patients in our phase trials increases 
this means that we will continue to operate at a loss for the foreseeable future and will need significant additional capital to fund our operations to a point when we can operate profitably 
xerecept sale 
in november  we sold our rights in xerecept to two subsidiaries of celtic for approximately million in upfront payments 
we may receive up to an additional million in contingent payments if celtic achieves certain development milestones for xerecept and we will be entitled to profit sharing and royalty payments if xerecept receives regulatory approval and is sold commercially 
the principal purpose of the xerecept sale was to focus our operations and limited capital resources on developing our core asset  viprinex 
through the sale of xerecept  we have been able to finance a portion of our operations while retaining a financial interest in the drug and have maintained much of our existing personnel and infrastructure as we provide clinical trial support services to celtic on a fee for services basis 
we expect that celtic will transition much of this support work to third party vendors in fiscal any reduction in the scope of our services to celtic will result in a decrease in our expected expenses and revenues under our arrangement with celtic 
memantine revenue 
since the commercial launch of ebixa by merz and namenda by forest  our royalties from memantine sales have grown considerably 
in april and july  we received quarterly royalty payments of million and million  respectively 
this compares to royalty payments of million and million for the same periods in the prior year 
although we are not provided with sales estimates from merz  forest or any other merz marketing partner  we expect that memantine sales will remain at or increase from these recent levels 
however  we are continuing discussions with merz and cmcc regarding our license and collaboration agreement and it is possible that this agreement could be amended or even terminated 
as a result  we cannot be certain that our royalty payments will continue in future periods 

table of contents critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of our evaluation form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider our accounting policies related to revenue recognition  research and development expenses  stock based compensation and valuation of equity financing warrants to be critical 
revenue recognition revenues are recorded according to the terms of formal agreements to which we are a party  when our performance requirements have been fulfilled  the fee is fixed and determinable and when collection of the fee is probable or reasonably assured 
revenues related to license fees with non cancelable  non refundable terms and no future performance obligations are recognized when collection is assured 
revenues associated with milestone payments  pursuant to the non cancelable and non refundable terms of agreements to which we are a party  are recognized when we have fulfilled development milestones and when collection of the fee is assured 
revenues resulting from royalty fees earned from the sale of the product are based upon the sales reported by our licensees and determined in accordance with the specific terms of the license agreements 
we record royalty revenues when payments are received because we are unable to estimate and accrue royalty revenues due to the limited sales history of memantine 
we have made no material adjustments to date for revenues recorded from royalty fees 
revenues received as a reimbursement of direct expenses incurred for performing services to administer clinical trials are recorded in the period during which the expenses are incurred 
we recognize revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and the securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue arrangements with multiple components are divided into separate units of accounting if certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered component has stand alone value to the customer  and whether there is objective reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
consideration received is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are identified and applied to each of the units 
technology sale and collaboration services revenues represent fees received from celtic under an asset purchase agreement and a collaboration and services agreement related to the sale of our worldwide rights and assets in xerecept in november in accordance with eitf issue no 
 the asset sale  together with the related clinical development services we provide  is treated as one unit of accounting because we are unable to determine the fair value of the future services to be provided by us under the collaboration and services agreement 
accordingly  we are recording the total upfront revenue of million from the sale of technology ratably over the six year term of the collaboration and services agreement  which began november  costs of collaboration 
table of contents services provided by us are billed on a monthly basis to celtic generally based on actual internal and external expenses incurred to administer the clinical trials of xerecept and recognized as revenues combined with the amount of revenues from the sale of technology 
costs of development services paid and related expenses are recognized as incurred 
potential future milestone payments and royalty sharing payments will be recognized as earned  provided that payment is reasonably assured 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include certain expenses that are incurred over multiple reporting periods  such as fees for contractors and consultants  patient treatment costs related to clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing costs  and license fees for use of third party intellectual property rights 
management assesses how much of these multi period costs should be charged to research and development expense in each reporting period by assessing the level and related costs of the services provided during each reporting period 
in determining whether clinical trial activities performed by third parties should be recognized in a specific reporting period  management considers estimates of the percentage of work completed through the applicable reporting period in accordance with agreements established with the third party service providers  and estimates of the percentage of work completed through the applicable reporting period in accordance with discussions with internal clinical and preclinical personnel and independent service providers as to the progress or stage of completion of trials or services and the agreed upon fee to be paid for such services 
the assessment of the percentage of work completed that determines the amount of research and development expense that should be recognized in a given period requires significant judgment and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
management applies judgment and bases its estimates on historical experience with the development of similar drugs and with third party contracts structured with similar performance and payment terms 
while our historical estimates have been materially accurate  we recognize that estimates of expenses incurred during current and future periods are determined greatly by patient enrollment levels and related activities  which may vary from historic patterns 
we monitor service providers activities to the extent possible in order to assess current enrollment levels and related activities  however  if we under or overestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time  we could materially under or overestimate research and development expenses in future periods 
stock based compensation effective july   we adopted the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  utilizing the modified prospective transition method  by which we have recognized the cost of stock based payments based on their grant date fair value from the beginning of the fiscal period in which the provisions of sfas no 
r were first adopted 
measuring and assigning of compensation cost for stock based grants made prior to  but not vested as of  the date of adopting sfas no 
r have been based upon the same estimate of grant date fair value previously disclosed under sfas no 
r in a pro forma manner 
the total amount of stock based compensation expense recognized during the year ended june  and was  and  respectively 
as of june   we had  of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements  which is expected to be recognized over the next years 

table of contents under sfas no 
r  the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model 
under that method  assumptions are made with respect to the expected lives of the options granted  the expected volatility of our stock  its dividend yield percentage and the risk free interest rate at the date of grant 
in addition  under sfas no 
r  we recognize and report stock based compensation expense  net of pre vesting forfeitures  which we estimate on the basis of historical forfeiture experience or other factors that could affect future forfeitures 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
prior to the implementation of sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock based awards under the intrinsic method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock options granted to employees and directors because the exercise price of the stock options equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
pro forma net loss and pro forma net loss per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
valuation of equity financing warrants we issued warrants in connection with equity financings pursuant to effective shelf registration statements 
we account for these warrants at fair value in accordance with eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s stock 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of these warrants 
use of this model requires us to make assumptions regarding stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the warrants and risk free interest rates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the fair value of these warrants reflected as of each balance sheet date and the resulting change in fair value that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous periods 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin no 
requires a company to recognize in its financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin no 
are effective for our fiscal year beginning july   with the cumulative effect  if any  of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin no 
on our consolidated financial statements  but we believe that fin no 
will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a market based framework or hierarchy for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is applicable whenever another accounting pronouncement requires or permits assets and liabilities to be 
table of contents measured at fair value 
sfas no 
does not expand or require any new fair value measures 
the provisions of sfas no 
are to be applied prospectively and are effective for our fiscal year beginning july  we are currently evaluating what effect  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits the measurement of many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
entities may choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates  reporting unrealized gains and losses on such items at each subsequent reporting period 
the objective of sfas no 
is to provide entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
it is intended to expand the use of fair value measurement 
sfas no 
is effective for our fiscal year beginning july  we are currently evaluating what effect  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  which requires nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities to be capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or services are performed 
the effects of applying eitf will be reported as a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings in the statement of financial position as of the beginning of the year of adoption 
eitf will be effective for our fiscal year beginning july  we are currently evaluating what effect  if any  the adoption of eitf will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
results of operations revenues fiscal year ended june  increase from prior year royalty revenue xerecept sale collaboration services revenues of  in fiscal increased by  over revenues of  in fiscal our fiscal revenues consisted of  of royalty fees earned from the commercial sales of memantine by merz and its marketing partners in the united states and certain european countries   from the sale of our worldwide rights and assets related to xerecept to two subsidiaries of celtic  and  from the reimbursement of the direct expenses incurred for services provided to celtic for administering the phase clinical trials for xerecept in the united states 
revenues of  in fiscal increased by  over revenues of  in fiscal our fiscal revenues consisted of  of royalty fees earned from the commercial sales of memantine by merz and its marketing partners in the united states and certain 
table of contents european countries   from the sale of our worldwide rights and assets related to xerecept to two subsidiaries of celtic  and  from the reimbursement of the direct expenses incurred for services provided to celtic for administering the phase clinical trials for xerecept in the united states 
our fiscal revenues consisted entirely of royalty fees earned from the sale of memantine in the united states and certain european countries by merz and its marketing partners 
we expect to record revenue from the sale of our worldwide rights and assets related to xerecept to two subsidiaries of celtic in the approximate amount of  annually through november  the period through which we are required to provide services to celtic under a related collaboration and services agreement 
in fiscal  we and celtic mutually agreed to reduce the extent of the services we will continue to provide and we currently expect our services in fiscal and beyond to be limited to support for chemistry manufacturing and controls 
merz and its marketing partners do not make anticipated future sales volumes available to us  nor  given the limited history of memantine sales  are we able to estimate future royalty revenues 
merz or cmcc can terminate our research and marketing cooperation agreement upon six months notice  as described above under the caption risk factors 
the amendment or termination of our agreement with merz or any failure by merz or its partners to successfully commercialize memantine or defend memantine against generic competition could reduce or terminate our future royalties under the research and marketing cooperation agreement and would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
research and development expenses fiscal year ended june  increase decrease from prior year viprinex xerecept research and development expenses of  in fiscal increased by  from expenses of  in fiscal the increase in research and development expenses resulted from an additional  of expenses incurred for the phase clinical trials of viprinex  which was partially offset by a decrease of  in expenses for the continuing phase clinical trials for xerecept 
the increase of  for viprinex consisted primarily of the following an increase in the cost of manufacturing and chemistry of  an increase in clinical consultants of  an increase of  in salaries and benefits  and an increase of  in marketing expenses  partially offset by a decrease of  in expenses associated with animal facilities 
the decrease of approximately  for xerecept consisted primarily of a decrease of  in manufacturing and chemistry expenses 
research and development expenses of  in fiscal increased by  from expenses of  in fiscal the increase included  of incremental expenses incurred to prepare for our two phase clinical trials for viprinex  which commenced enrollment in november and march  respectively  and  of incremental expenses for the continuing phase clinical trials for xerecept  which were initiated in april and 
table of contents february  respectively 
the  increase in research and development expenses incurred for viprinex resulted primarily from approximately  for clinical  statistical and consulting expenses  approximately  of compensation and related benefit expenses  including approximately  of stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees  approximately  for depreciation of clinical material production equipment  and approximately  of incremental travel expenses  partially offset by a reduction of  related to the manufacture of viprinex clinical materials 
the  increase of research and development expenses for xerecept resulted primarily from approximately  of clinical and regulatory consulting fees  approximately  for the manufacture of xerecept clinical materials and approximately  of compensation and related benefit expense for an increased level of personnel dedicated to the xerecept program  including approximately  of stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to employees  and approximately  in increased legal fees 
all expenses for the development and commercialization of memantine are borne by merz and its marketing partners  forest and lundbeck 
we have incurred approximately million of expenses for the development of viprinex for the period from july   the date at which we purchased empire  through june  these expenditures do not include expenses of  in fiscal and  in fiscal  which represent charges associated with acquired in process research and development 
we estimate that the additional cost of manufacturing including process development  validation runs to produce commercial batches and product production for clinical trials  completion of the two phase clinical trials  quality control activities  regulatory activities  and other pre commercial expenses for viprinex will exceed million 
however  these estimates are subject to the uncertainties inherent in conducting clinical trials and seeking regulatory approval for product candidates 
as discussed above under results of operations revenues  we expect that our expenses and corresponding revenues from our development agreement with celtic will be lower in fiscal and beyond 
research and development expenditures are charged to operations as incurred 
research and development expenses  including direct and allocated expenses  consist of independent research and development expenses and expenses associated with sponsored research and development 
material cash inflows resulting from the successful completion and commercialization of our current research and development projects are estimable and realizable only if our clinical trials are successfully completed and our drug candidate is approved by the fda 
because of the inherent uncertainty relating to clinical trials and receipt of regulatory approval by the fda  we cannot estimate the amount or timing of receipt for significant cash inflows resulting from the potential successful commercialization of our drug candidate 
acquired in process research and development fiscal year ended june  decrease increase from prior year we acquired empire  a development stage company  in july in order to secure the worldwide rights to viprinex 
the terms of the purchase agreement provided for initial and contingent 
table of contents payments  requiring us to pay one half of the purchase price upon closing and one half of the purchase price if and when pivotal phase clinical trials for viprinex commenced 
the acquisition of empire was recorded as a purchase of assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and  accordingly  the purchase price was allocated to tangible assets and acquired in process research and development based on their relative fair values 
at the date of acquisition in july  the initial payment to empire of  consisting of common stock valued at  and cash of  and acquisition related expenses of  were assigned to the assets acquired based on their relative fair values 
in november  we initiated phase trials for viprinex  which required us to make a contingent payment to the selling stockholders of empire 
this payment of  was made in december and consisted of an additional  shares of common stock valued at  and cash of  and was assigned to the assets acquired based on their relative fair values 
during the identification and valuation process related to the acquisition  we determined that the acquired in process research and development related to viprinex had a fair value of  associated with the initial payment made in july and  associated with the contingent payment in december at the date of the purchase and payment of the contingent amount  viprinex had not received regulatory approval to be marketed and the in process research and development had no alternative future uses  in accordance with the criteria described in the practice aid titled assets acquired in a business combination to be used in research and development activities  published by the american institute of certified public accountants 
accordingly  the acquired in process research and development was charged to expense at the time the initial and contingent payments were made 
general and administrative expenses fiscal year ended june  increase from prior year general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal increased  over expenses of  in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses resulted primarily from increases of approximately  for compensation   for consultants and  for audit fees  offset by a decrease in legal fees of  general and administrative expenses of  in fiscal increased  over expenses of  in fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses results primarily from an increase of approximately  in compensation  which includes approximately  of stock based compensation expense for stock options granted to administrative employees and directors  and an increase of approximately  for legal fees associated with pursuing various strategic alternatives  including the sale of our worldwide rights and assets related to xerecept

although the terms of the warrants do not provide for net cash settlement  in certain circumstances  physical or net share settlement is deemed not to be within our control and  accordingly  we are required to account for these warrants as a derivative financial instrument liability  rather than as stockholder s equity 
the warrant liability is initially measured and recorded at the warrants fair value  and is then re valued at each reporting date with changes in the fair value reported as non cash charges or credits to earnings 
for warrant based derivative financial instruments  the black scholes option pricing model is used to value the warrant liability 
the classification of derivative instruments  including whether these instruments should be recorded as liabilities or as equity  is re assessed at the end of each reporting period

we have entered into agreements with service providers and clinical sites that administer and conduct our clinical trials  respectively 
we generally make payments to the service providers and sites based upon the number of patients enrolled 
we have estimated the future patient enrollment costs based on the number of patients that we expect to enroll and have included those estimates in the table below 
these estimates may not be achieved in the periods indicated  and the payments could vary materially 
as we move forward with the clinical development of viprinex  we may enter into contractual commitments for additional expenditures relating to these clinical trials  these additional expenditures are not reflected in the table below 
following the table is a brief summary of certain principal terms of key contracts under which we have potentially significant payment obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations other long term commitments commitments to clinical research organizations commitments to manufacturers commitments to licensor commitments to other total in july  upon our acquisition of empire  we acquired the rights to an exclusive royalty bearing license from abbott for viprinex 
under this license  we have the exclusive worldwide rights to viprinex for all human therapeutic indications 
pursuant to our license agreement with abbott  we have an obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop viprinex for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke and  if viprinex receives regulatory approval from the fda  to market the product for that indication 
we will be required to make milestone payments of up to an aggregate of million  consisting of payments of i  upon receiving regulatory approval in the united states and ii  upon first approval in each of europe  latin america and asia 
commitments to the licensor provide for the potential commitment for the four payments of  each to abbott for anticipated regulatory approval of viprinex in the united states and europe in and  respectively  and latin america and asia in we will also be required to make royalty payments to abbott based on worldwide viprinex sales 
our royalty obligations will terminate on a country by country basis as the applicable patents for viprinex expire in each applicable country  which will generally occur between and depending on the patent and the country 
to date  we have made no payments to abbott under this agreement 
prior to our acquisition of the rights to viprinex in connection with our acquisition of empire in july  empire had paid abbott a total of  in license fees under this agreement 
the agreement will continue until terminated by either party 
abbott has the right to terminate the agreement only in the event of our breach  and we have the right to terminate the agreement for our convenience upon providing days notice 

table of contents in january  we entered into an agreement with nordmark  which was amended in march  pursuant to which nordmark established a snake farm and a purification unit for the supply of raw venom of the malayan pit viper  the starting material for viprinex 
under the agreement  both we and nordmark are responsible for funding this effort  and we were obligated to make payments to nordmark of million or approximately million toward the costs of the snake farm and purification unit  which are owned and operated by nordmark 
the final payment for the establishment of the snake farm was made in january we are also obligated to pay nordmark for certain operating costs until the commercialization of viprinex 
if  among other things  we abandon the development and or commercialization of viprinex before the end of  we will be required to reimburse nordmark for certain operating costs and make an additional payment of up to million or approximately million 
we have also agreed to pay for certain fully burdened costs and certain other expenses to nordmark 
as of june   our remaining aggregate contractual commitment to nordmark under the agreement  for the cost of the snake farm and purification unit and related operating costs  is million or approximately million 
in march  we entered into a supply agreement with nordmark  pursuant to which nordmark supplies us with the active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  of viprinex 
pursuant to this agreement  we paid nordmark  or approximately  to purchase equipment for the development and manufacture of viprinex 
for the supply of the api  we are required to make periodic payments over the term of the contract totaling million or approximately million as work is performed  of which million or approximately million has been paid as of june  the agreement will continue until  unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
our outstanding contractual commitment to nordmark for the march agreement as of june  was million or approximately million 
in july  we entered into an agreement with scirex  pursuant to which scirex serves as the clinical research organization supporting our phase clinical program for viprinex 
this agreement was amended in april and the scope of services to be performed by scirex was significantly reduced 
the agreement  as amended  provides for aggregate payments to scirex of approximately million over the term of the agreement  which will end upon the completion of the project in based on our current estimates 
our outstanding contractual commitment to scirex as of june  was approximately million 
in april  we entered into an agreement with icon  pursuant to which icon serves as the clinical research organization supporting our phase clinical program for viprinex in certain european countries 
the agreement provides for aggregate payments to icon of million including pass through costs over the term of the agreement  and is to end upon the completion of the project  which was expected to occur in our outstanding contractual commitment to icon as of june  was approximately million 
at june   our balance of available cash  cash equivalents and investment securities was  as described above  we expect to incur increased costs in fiscal primarily for phase clinical trials for viprinex  along with related administrative support costs 
the product development expenses for xerecept are the responsibility of celtic  for which we are reimbursed  and all development costs for memantine are paid by merz  together with its marketing partners 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and investment balances as of june   along with the reimbursement of our ongoing development costs for xerecept  anticipated 
table of contents royalties from sales of memantine  and the proceeds from our september debt financing  which matures on january   will provide adequate liquidity to fund our operations through december in order to continue as a going concern for the next months  we will need to raise capital from external sources 
in an effort to raise additional working capital  we filed a registration statement in august and plan to sell up to million of common stock in an underwritten offering 
the offering  if successful  is expected to close in october there can be no assurance that this offering will be completed on favorable terms  if at all  and the issuance of additional securities needed to fund our operations could significantly dilute our existing stockholders 
if we are unable to raise capital as needed  our clinical trials may be delayed significantly and we may be required to curtail or cease operations 
our future capital requirements are difficult to estimate and will depend on a number of factors  including the following the cost of our clinical development program for viprinex  the amount of royalties received from merz for future sales of memantine  the receipt of payments pursuant to our agreements with celtic  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the acquisition or licensing of new drug candidates  competing technological and market developments  our ability to establish collaborative relationships  and the development of commercialization activities and arrangements

the primary objective for our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in widely diversified short term investments  consisting primarily of investment grade securities 
as of june   the fair value of our investments was approximately million  of our total portfolio will mature in one year or less  and the total portfolio had duration of less than six months 
a hypothetical basis point decrease or increase in interest rates would not result in a material decrease or increase in the fair value of our available for sale securities 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk
