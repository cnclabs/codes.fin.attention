item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
refer to forward looking statements following the index and item a risk factors of this form k overview our business we develop  manufacture  and sell a complete line of reagents and automated systems used primarily by hospitals  clinical laboratories and blood banks in tests performed to detect and identify certain properties of human blood prior to blood transfusion 
we have manufacturing facilities in the united states and canada 
we sell our products from these facilities and through our affiliates in germany  italy  belgium  spain  portugal and japan 
the fda regulates all aspects of the immunohematology industry  including marketing of reagents and instruments used to detect and identify blood properties 
our industry has been very labor intensive but in recent years it has made noticeable advances in automating certain manual processes 
we believe that companies that successfully introduced new technologies and automated products have seen their profitability improve 
we have introduced several instruments in the past  and we continue to focus on developing new instruments and improving our existing instruments 
in june  we received fda clearance to market our latest instrument  galileo echo  which is a compact bench top  fully automated walk away instrument for small and medium sized hospitals  blood banks and transfusion laboratories 
echo uses capture products  our proprietary reagents  and offers an extensive test menu and significant labor reduction while increasing productivity and patient safety 
we expect to increase our market share and revenues from the sale of echo and galileo instruments and the sale of capture products in the near term 
instruments and capture products currently account for approximately of our revenues 
performance in fiscal we continued to focus on increasing revenue and improving gross margins  using the strategies we first implemented in fiscal we also concentrated our efforts on ensuring that the echo was ready for submission to the fda for clearance and would start generating revenue in fiscal as part of this effort  we made changes in our organization structure  and hired and trained additional sales and technical personnel to ensure the smooth introduction of this new product 
we also continued to place galileo instruments in the market 
during fiscal  we received purchase orders for galileo instruments 
our overall gross margin increased to for fiscal year from achieved in fiscal year and achieved in fiscal the increase in revenue and a improvement in overall gross margin during the year ended may   as compared to the prior year period  were mainly attributable to the price increases introduced in fiscal and our reporting of revenue and gross margins is affected by the application of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the accounting treatment mandated by this pronouncement results in the deferral of certain revenue for sales agreements that have multiple deliverables while the related costs are recorded up front 
as of may   may  and may   we had deferred revenue liabilities of approximately million  million and million  respectively  and a major portion of these balances related to the deferral of revenue from sale of instruments 
in fiscal  we were again successful in containing operating expenses which rose by only while revenues increased by  which translated into a increase in net income compared to the prior year 
increased revenues  improved gross margin  and containment of expenses contributed to our achieving a third consecutive record year of growth in terms of revenue and net income 
this is reflected in the increase in our cash resources and short term investments from million at may  to million at may  business outlook for fiscal  our primary focus will be in successfully introducing and marketing our new instrument  the galileo echo to small and medium size customers 
we will also continue to focus on placing galileo instruments with larger customers 
over the next few years  we expect our core business to shift gradually from being mainly a supplier of traditional reagents to being a major supplier of automated instruments that use our proprietary capture technology and products 
simultaneously  we intend to increase our research and development efforts to introduce the next version of the galileo with additional and improved features 
however  with the probable change in sales mix as more instruments are sold  it could be difficult to sustain the overall gross margin of achieved in fiscal the higher margins on the capture reagents used on our instruments may not be enough to offset the lower margins on the instruments themselves 
moreover  there is likely to be further pressure on our overall gross margin because we are required by eitf to expense the cost of instruments up front and then spread the revenue over the entire period of sale contracts with reagent price guarantees  and we will need to hire additional service personnel to support the echo launch 
we expect to improve our margins on reagents but at a slower rate than those achieved in the last three years 
listed below are the key factors which we expect will drive revenue and improve reagent gross margins in fiscal introduction of galileo echo we expect to further improve our competitive position going into fiscal through the launch of the galileo echo  which is being released in european and us markets in the first quarter of fiscal galileo echo is significantly smaller and faster than our abs  and has substantially all of the features of our larger instrument  galileo  apart from lower throughput 
we believe the galileo echo will appeal to the small to medium sized hospital market  the largest segment of our customers approximately  to  worldwide  to which our abs instrument was previously marketed 
we expect to gradually increase our share in this market and increase revenues from sales of our capture products 
increased market penetration by galileo we expect capture revenues to increase in fiscal  as we continue to increase galileo placements 
as of may   we have received purchase orders for galileo instruments from european customers since introducing the galileo to the european market in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  as of may  galileo purchase orders have been received from us customers since fda clearance was received in april  galileo purchase orders have been received from canadian customers since health canada clearance was received in july  and two purchase orders have been received from japanese customers since ministry of health clearance was received in july as of may   of these instruments were generating reagent revenues 
expanding our customer loyalty program we continue to offer our customer loyalty program to expand reagent utilization throughout our customer base 
the program promotes customer loyalty and higher sales volumes while partially shielding our more loyal customers from the effects of price increases 
increased manufacturing efficiencies our decision to consolidate manufacturing operations in norcross  georgia and close the houston  texas facility by december will further reduce overheads and improve margins and net income 
results of operations comparison of years ended may  and may  for the year ended may  change amount in thousands net sales gross profit gross profit percentage n m operating expenses income from operations non operating income n m income before income tax provision for income tax net income improved sales and margins  along with a proportionately lower increase in operating expenses  resulted in an increase in net income for fiscal of million  higher than fiscal of the million  or  increase in operating expenses  stock compensation expense relating to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  effective june   accounted for million and the weakening of the us dollar against the euro in fiscal accounted for approximately million 
a large portion of the remaining increase was related to the launch of echo and the anticipated growth of our instrument business 
the expense relating to the adoption of sfas r and the impact of the weakening of the us dollar against the euro together accounted for of the million increase in the operating expenses 
diluted earnings per share totaled for fiscal  as compared to diluted earnings per share of for the prior year  an increase of 
united states operations continue to generate a majority of our revenue and operating income 
us operations generated and  respectively  of our revenue and operating income in fiscal compared to and  respectively  in fiscal net sales for the year ended may  change amount in thousands traditional reagents capture products instruments collagen the growth in traditional reagent revenue ie products not using our patented capture technology in fiscal compared to fiscal occurred mainly as a result of price increases in the united states 
traditional reagent sales have historically been our primary source of revenue and still constitute roughly of our revenue 
we expect the significance of this line of products to gradually decline as we place more instruments in the market and increase sales of our capture products 
sales of capture products increased by million  or  in fiscal compared to fiscal mainly due to volume increase million and price increases million in the us  exchange rate gains of million due to strengthening of euro against the us dollar and an increase of million was attributable to our foreign affiliates 
sales of capture products are largely dependent on the number of installed instruments requiring the use of capture reagents 
as we succeed in placing more instruments in the market  we expect revenue from capture products to increase 
revenue from instruments increased by in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  million of deferred revenue was recognized from previously placed instruments compared to million recognized in fiscal most instrument sales in the united states are recognized over the life of the underlying reagent contract  which is normally five years 
in fiscal approximately million of instrument sales and associated service revenues were deferred in this manner  compared to million in fiscal as of may  and may   deferred instrument and service revenues totaled million and million  respectively 
we expect to place more galileo instruments in the market and begin generating revenues from the sale of our new galileo echo instruments for which we received fda clearance in june human collagen forms a very small part of our business  and we expect to discontinue this product in fiscal when our manufacturing commitment expires 
gross margin for the year ended may  change amount margin amount margin amount in in in traditional reagents capture products instruments collagen overall gross margin improved during fiscal to  up from in fiscal  due to improvement in margins in all three main categories of our business 
gross margin on traditional reagents improved by to primarily due to price increases 
the gross margin on capture products improved by to due to volume and price increases 
in the case of instruments  comparing gross margin from period to period can be misleading because of the way revenue and cost for certain types of instrument sales are recorded 
where sales contracts have price guarantee clauses  instrument costs are expensed when the sale is made  but the related revenue is deferred and recorded as income over the term of the agreement 
for fiscal  the gross margin on instruments was a negative and  for fiscal  it was a negative 
in fiscal  we deferred million less revenue million in fiscal  million in fiscal from sales of instruments and recognized million more revenue million in fiscal  million in fiscal compared to fiscal both these factors largely contributed towards the improvement of margin on instruments 
the gross margin on human collagen sales was in fiscal compared to in fiscal due to an increase in costs 
operating expenses for the year ended may  change amount in thousands research and development selling and marketing distribution general and administrative restructuring expense amortization expense and other total operating expenses an increase in research and development expenses of million  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was mainly attributable to an increase in consultancy fees of million relating to the second generation galileo  an accrual for bonuses of million  an increase in compensation cost of million on adoption of sfas r  an increase in salaries and payroll taxes of million  an increase in laboratory supplies of million primarily for echo clinical trials  and an increase in depreciation charges of million 
in fiscal  no costs were recorded for sfas r  bonuses or the second generation galileo 
as we reached the final phase of the development of the galileo echo in fiscal  the spending on this project was minimal compared to million spent in fiscal an increase in selling and marketing expenses of million to million  or  over the prior fiscal year was largely due to an increase in salaries  payroll taxes and staff moving expenses of million  an increase in compensation cost of million on adoption of sfas r  an increase in travel and convention costs of million  an accrual for bonuses of million and an increase in staff commissions of million 
we increased our sales staff to by hiring additional sales personnel in preparation for the launch of the echo and also to more aggressively market the galileo 
this accounted for a major portion of the increase in the personnel cost in fiscal the impact of the weakening of the us dollar against the euro by about in fiscal accounted for an increase of approximately million in selling and marketing expenses of the european affiliates 
an increase in distribution expenses of million  or  in fiscal over fiscal was mainly due to an increase in freight expenses of million as a result of increased shipments of instruments and setting up costs for centralization of european operations in germany  an increase in salaries of million  an increase in our new japanese affiliate s distribution costs of million  and an increase in compensation cost of million on adoption of sfas r 
general and administrative expenses rose marginally in fiscal by million  or  to million over fiscal in fiscal  professional fees legal  audit  sox and tax decreased by approximately million  mainly due to a reduction in outsourcing of certain work relating the documentation and testing of the internal controls to ensure compliance with the sarbanes oxley act requirements and a reduction in legal fees relating to the italian investigation 
the savings in professional fees was mostly off set by an increase in compensation cost of million on adoption of sfas r  an increase in salaries  payroll taxes and bonus of million  an increase in recruiting cost of million and an increase in consultancy fees of million 
the impact of the weakening of the us dollar against the euro by about in fiscal accounted for approximately million increase in general and administrative expenses of the european affiliates 
we are consolidating our manufacturing operations in norcross  georgia and closing the houston plant 
this action resulted in restructuring charges of million in fiscal we spent million for production consolidation  million for retention bonuses and million for relocation expenses 
in fiscal  of the total charge of million  million was for the impairment of long lived assets at the houston facility 
this plant closure is expected to be complete by december the total cost of restructuring is estimated at million  of which million has already been incurred as of may  the future cash outlay for the houston plant closure  all of which is expected to occur in fiscal  is estimated at approximately million 
non operating income for the year ended may  change amount in thousands non operating income in fiscal  we earned million more interest income compared to fiscal due to the increase in our cash resources by million  miscellaneous items accounted for the balance of the increase of million 
income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million in fiscal from the prior year  primarily due to higher pre tax income  partially offset with a decease in the overall effective tax rate to for fiscal  compared to for fiscal net deferred tax assets increased by million mainly due to an increase in deferred revenue of approximately million and an increase of million in reserves not currently deductible  off set by minor changes in other items resulting in a net decrease of million 
as a result of utilizing compensation cost deductions arising from the exercise of nonqualified employee stock options for federal and state income tax purposes  we realized income tax benefits of approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal as required by us generally accepted accounting principles  these income tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements as additions to additional paid in capital rather than as reductions of the respective income tax provisions in the consolidated financial statement because the related compensation deductions are not recognized as compensation expense for financial reporting purposes 
our income tax liability is reduced by these amounts 
comparison of years ended may  and may  for the year ended may  change amount in thousands net sales gross profit gross profit percentage operating expenses income from operations non operating income n m income before income tax provision for income tax net income improved sales and margins  along with a proportionately lower increase in operating expenses  resulted in net income for fiscal of million  or  higher than fiscal of the million  or  increase in the operating expenses  the acquisition of a new japanese subsidiary in july  accounted for million and the restructuring expenses relating to the planned closure of our houston facility accounted for million 
these two expense items together accounted for of the million increase in the operating expenses 
diluted earnings per share totaled for fiscal  as compared to diluted earnings per share of for the prior year  an increase of 
united states operations continued to generate a majority of our revenue and operating income 
us operations generated and  respectively  of our revenue and operating income in fiscal compared to and  respectively  in fiscal net sales for the year ended may  change amount in thousands traditional reagents capture products instruments collagen the growth in traditional reagent revenue ie products not using our patented capture technology occurred mainly as a result of price increases  the effect of which was marginally offset approximately million by a slight decrease in sales volume in the united states 
the increase in capture revenue is primarily attributable to the change of marketing strategy in january from selling products in kits to selling individual components and to price increases 
sales of instruments were million in fiscal and fiscal most instrument sales in the united states are recognized over the life of the underlying reagent contract  which is normally five years 
in fiscal approximately million of instrument sales and associated service revenue were deferred in this manner  compared to million in fiscal  a increase 
as of may  and may   deferred instrument and service revenues totaled million and million  respectively 
revenue recognized from instrument sales and associated service revenue was approximately million in fiscal and million in fiscal  a increase 
sales of human collagen were million in fiscal  an increase of million compared to the prior year 
gross margin for the year ended may  change amount margin amount margin amount in in in traditional reagents capture products instruments n m collagen gross margin of on traditional reagents for fiscal was higher than the achieved in the prior year  primarily due to benefits from higher prices and manufacturing efficiencies 
for fiscal  the gross margin on instruments was a negative and for fiscal it was a negative 
in fiscal  we recorded more cost from sales of instruments but the growth in revenue recognized was at a slower rate 
this resulted in negative gross margin increasing to from in fiscal operating expenses for the year ended may  change amount in thousands research and development selling and marketing distribution general and administrative restructuring expense n m amortization expense and other total operating expenses research and development expenses were million for fiscal  million higher than those recorded in the prior fiscal year 
as we reached the final phase of the development of the galileo echo  the new third generation instrument targeted for the small to medium sized hospital market  the spending on this project decreased to million in fiscal from million spent in fiscal cost incurred on other projects accounted for a net increase of million in the research and development expenses for fiscal compared to fiscal selling and marketing expenses increased by approximately million to million  or over the prior fiscal year 
the japanese affiliate  which was acquired in the first quarter of fiscal  added million to selling and marketing expenses in the current fiscal year 
distribution expenses for fiscal were million which was marginally less than the amount incurred in the prior fiscal year 
the japanese affiliate added million to distribution expenses in fiscal general and administrative expenses in fiscal rose million  or  to million over fiscal the increase was attributable primarily to sarbanes oxley compliance million  hiring of new personnel million and severance cost million 
the japanese affiliate added million to general and administration expenses in fiscal our decision to consolidate our manufacturing operations in norcross  georgia resulted in restructuring charges of million in fiscal year of the total charge of million  million was for the impairment of long lived assets at the houston  texas facility 
no restructuring charges were recorded in fiscal year income taxes the provision for income taxes increased million in fiscal from the prior year  primarily due to higher pre tax income with the overall effective tax rate for fiscal and remaining at 
deferred tax assets pertaining to operating loss carry forwards increased by approximately million  of which approximately million related to our foreign affiliates a major portion of it relating to the european restructure and to the operating loss incurred by the japanese affiliate acquired in fiscal and approximately million was for state operating losses relating to unwinding of the state and local tax structure implemented in it is more likely than not that these tax losses will not be used and as a result we have recorded deferred tax valuation allowances against these assets 
this is reflected in an increase in the deferred tax valuation allowances of million 
as a result of utilizing compensation cost deductions arising from the exercise of nonqualified employee stock options for federal and state income tax purposes  we realized income tax benefits of approximately million in fiscal and fiscal as required by us generally accepted accounting principles  these income tax benefits are recognized in our financial statements as additions to additional paid in capital rather than as reductions of the respective income tax provisions in the consolidated financial statements because the related compensation deductions are not recognized as compensation expense for financial reporting purposes 
our income tax liability is reduced by these amounts 
liquidity and capital resources our principal source of liquidity is our operating cash flow 
this cash generating capability is one of our fundamental strengths and provides us with substantial financial flexibility in meeting operating  investing and financing needs 
we have adequate working capital and sources of capital to carry on our current business and to meet our existing capital requirements 
at may   we had working capital of million  compared to million of working capital at may  the following table shows the cash flows provided by or used in operating  investing and financing activities for fiscal years  and  as well as the effect of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents for those same years for the year ended may  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents increase in cash and cash equivalents our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at may   as compared to million at may  in fiscal  we spent million to repurchase our stock  million less than the million we spent in fiscal we also used million to repay long term obligations in the current period  million less than our cash outlay of million in the previous fiscal year 
besides an increase of million in net income  these two factors  along with a million increase in tax benefits received from the exercise of stock options in the current year compared to the previous year  significantly contributed to the increase in the cash resources in fiscal in fiscal  we paid million for the purchase of immucor kainos  repaid million of long term debt and capital leases and spent million to repurchase shares of our common stock under the stock repurchase plan 
these significant and non recurring payments were more than compensated for by million in cash generated through operating activities for fiscal  resulting in net improvement of million in cash and cash equivalent balances in fiscal operating activities net cash generated by operating activities was million for the year ended may   a million decrease over the million generated in the year ended may  the increase in net income of million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal was offset by  among other things  an adjustment of approximately million for the tax benefit arising on exercise of stock options which is required to be disclosed as cash generated by financing activities since our adoption of sfas r effective june  we reported this tax benefit as cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years and an increase in accounts receivable and inventory levels by approximately and million  respectively  in fiscal also adversely impacted the cash generated by operating activities 
accounts receivable increased due to higher revenues in fiscal  approximately million of the inventory increase was due to the build up of inventory of instruments and related parts in anticipation of an increase in instrument shipments in the near term 
in fiscal  net cash generated by operating activities was million  a million increase over the million generated in the year ended may  this increase was primarily driven by a million  or  increase in net income  adjusted for non cash income statement items  in fiscal compared to fiscal positive movement in certain components of working capital further improved the cash generated from operating activities  significantly  an increase in deferred revenue contributed million of cash in fiscal compared to million in fiscal another major factor in the increase in cash generated from operating activities was the improved management of inventory  accounts receivable and accounts payable  additional capital required for these components of working capital during fiscal was million compared to million increase in fiscal in fiscal  net cash generated by operating activities was million  an million increase over the million generated in the year ended may  this increase was primarily driven by a million  or  increase in net income  adjusted for non cash income statement items  and million due to reduction in net operating assets 
investing activities in fiscal  million of cash was used in investing activities  primarily for capital expenditures million  partly offset by proceeds of million received from sale of short term investments 
the million in capital expenditures for fiscal consisted primarily of million for building  machinery and equipment and furniture additions and upgrades  million for instruments used for demonstration purposes or placed at customer sites under leasing arrangements  and million for computer hardware and software enhancements and replacements 
planned capital expenditures for fiscal total million  including million for building renovations  million for instruments to be used for leasing contracts  million for upgrades of manufacturing  quality and support systems  million in computer hardware and software expenditures for infrastructure upgrades and million for other miscellaneous items 
in fiscal  million of cash was used in investing activities primarily for the acquisition of immucor kainos  inc million and capital expenditures million 
the million in capital expenditures for fiscal consisted primarily of million for building  machinery and equipment and furniture additions and upgrades  million for computer hardware and software enhancements and replacements  and million for instruments used for demonstration purposes or placed at customer sites on reagent rental agreements 
in fiscal  million of cash was used in investing activities consisting primarily of capital expenditures totaling million and investments in marketable debt securities totaling million  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of our long term investment in lionheart technologies  inc the million in capital expenditures for the year ended may  consisted primarily of million for instruments  million for machinery and equipment upgrades for use primarily at our norcross facility  and million for computer hardware and software enhancements of the enterprise software system 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities totaled million in fiscal  compared to million and million of cash used in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
in fiscal  we used million to repurchase shares of our common stock  compared to the million and million spent in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we had a cash outlay of million in fiscal to pay part of our acquisition liability  while in fiscal and fiscal  we repaid million and million of our long term debt  respectively 
we received million  million and million from the exercise of employee stock options in fiscal  and  respectively 
in connection with our adoption of sfas r in fiscal year  we reported million of excess tax benefits from share based compensation as cash provided by financing activities  which was reported as cash provided by operating activities in fiscal years million and million 
our cash position and cash generated by operations allowed us to repay all capital lease obligations and long term borrowings from financial institutions during fiscal and stock repurchase program during the fiscal year ended may   we repurchased  shares of common stock for approximately million at an average per share price of  bringing the aggregate number of shares to  repurchased under that program through may  in fiscal and fiscal  the total amount spent for the shares bought under this program amounted to million and million  respectively 
since the introduction of the plan in  we have repurchased shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of approximately million 
as of may    shares were available for repurchase under the program 
contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose contingent liabilities when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
while we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings  we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
contingent liabilities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
future cash requirements and restrictions in july  we paid kainos million approximately million in cash on signing of the purchase agreements  and are required to pay an additional million approximately million over three years with minimum payments of million in each of the first two years and the remaining million in the third year 
as of may   we have paid million approximately million of this liability 
in addition  a final payment of million approximately million will be made after a three year transition period ending on june   or earlier upon mutual agreement 
we expect that cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to support operations and planned capital expenditures for the next months 
we have no long term debt except the acquisition liability for the purchase of immucor kainos 
there are no restrictions on our foreign subsidiaries in the matter of sending dividends  or making loans or advances to the parent company 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments  primarily for the next five years  are detailed in the table below contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt and lines of credit capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations includes outstanding purchase commitments and commitments to celliance  ltd 
and bio tek instruments  inc as more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
represents japan acquisition liability 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet financial arrangements as of may  critical accounting policies and estimates general we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and certain assumptions could prove to be incorrect 
senior management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates and the related management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations disclosure with the audit committee of our board of directors 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to the following i 
revenue recognition ii 
trade accounts receivables and allowance for doubtful accounts iii 
inventory iv 
goodwill v 
taxation vi 
stock based compensation i revenue recognition in accordance with the staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  guidance  we recognize revenue when the following four basic criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
reagent sales revenue from the sale of our reagents to end users is recognized upon shipment when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  unless there are specific contractual terms to the contrary 
revenue from the sale of our reagents to distributors is recognized fob customs clearance when both title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
medical instrument sales revenue from the sale of our medical instruments without multiple deliverables is generally recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations 
revenue from rentals of our medical instruments is recognized over the term of the rental agreement 
instrument service contract revenue is recognized over the term of the contract 
in cases of sales of instruments with multiple deliverables  we recognize revenue on the sale of medical instruments in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
our medical instrument sales contracts with multiple deliverables include the sale or rental of an instrument including delivery  installation and training  the servicing of the instrument during the first year  and  in many cases  price guarantees for consumables purchased during the contract period 
we have determined the fair value of certain of these elements  such as training and first year service 
the portion of the instrument sales price applicable to the instrument itself is recognized upon shipment and completion of contractual obligations relating to training and or installation 
if the agreement does not include any price guarantees  the sales price in excess of the fair values of training and service is allocated to the instrument itself 
the fair value of a training session is recognized as revenue when services are provided 
if multiple training sessions are contractually provided  then additional training revenue is recognized upon delivery 
the fair value of first year service is recognized over the first year of the contract 
if the agreement contains price guarantees  the entire arrangement consideration is deferred and recognized over the related guarantee period due to the fair value of the price guarantee not being determinable at the point of sale 
the allocation of the total consideration  which is based on the estimated fair value of the units of accounting  requires judgment by management 
ii trade accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts trade receivables at may   totaling million  and at may   totaling million  are net of allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  respectively 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay their debts 
the collectibility of trade receivable balances is regularly evaluated based on a combination of factors such as customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment patterns 
if it is determined that a customer will be unable to fully meet its financial obligation  such as in the case of a bankruptcy filing or other material events impacting its business  a specific allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded to reduce the related receivable to the amount expected to be recovered 
iii inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market net realizable value 
cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
we use a standard cost system as a tool to monitor production efficiency 
the standard cost system applies estimated labor and manufacturing overhead factors to inventory based on budgeted production and efficiency levels  staffing levels and costs of operation  based on the experience and judgment of management 
actual costs and production levels may vary from the standard established and such variances are charged to the consolidated statement of income as a component of cost of sales 
since us generally accepted accounting principles require that the standard cost approximate actual cost  periodic adjustments are made to the standard rates to approximate actual costs 
the provision for obsolete and or excess inventory is reviewed on a quarterly basis or  if warranted by circumstances  more frequently 
in evaluating this reserve  management considers technology changes  competition  customer demand  product shelf life and manufacturing quality 
no material changes have been made to the inventory policy during fiscal  or iv goodwill on adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
intangible assets that have finite lives are continuing to be amortized over their useful lives 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill as at the end of the third quarter of each year and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
such circumstances could include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in business climate  unanticipated competition  or an adverse action or assessment by a regulator 
when evaluating whether goodwill is impaired  we compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is assigned to the reporting unit s carrying amount  including goodwill 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using primarily the income  or discounted cash flows  approach 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of the impairment loss must be measured 
the impairment loss would be calculated by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount 
in calculating the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the other assets and liabilities of that unit based on their fair values 
the excess of the fair value of a reporting unit over the amount assigned to its other assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our evaluation of goodwill completed during the year resulted in no impairment charges 
v income taxes our income tax policy records the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the value of our deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  and we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  carry back opportunities  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we assess the need for additional valuation allowances quarterly 
no material changes have been made to the income tax policy during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements 
vi stock based employee compensation in december  the financial accounting standards board revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas r  requiring companies to record share based payments to employees as compensation expense at the grant date fair value 
we adopted sfas r on june   using the modified prospective transition method  which requires that i compensation costs be recorded as earned for all unvested stock options outstanding at the beginning of the first fiscal year of adoption of sfas r based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and ii for compensation costs for all share based payments granted or modified subsequent to the adoption be recorded  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  we have not restated the financial statements for prior periods and those statements do not include the impact of sfas r 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we elected to attribute the value of share based compensation to expense using the straight line method  which was previously used for disclosing our pro forma information required under sfas prior to adopting sfas r  we presented all tax benefits resulting from the exercise of stock options as operating cash flows in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires cash flows resulting from excess tax benefits to be classified as a part of cash flows from financing activities 
excess tax benefits are realized tax benefits from tax deductions for exercised options in excess of the deferred tax asset attributable to stock compensation costs for such options 
we elected to value our share based payment awards using the black scholes option pricing model the black scholes model  which was previously used for disclosing our pro forma information required under sfas for fiscal years and the black scholes model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
the black scholes model requires the input of certain assumptions 
our stock options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and changes in the assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimates 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of sfas r 
we have calculated our additional paid in capital pool apic pool based on the actual income tax benefits received from exercises of stock options granted after the effective date of sfas using the long method 
the apic pool is available to absorb any tax deficiencies subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of statement no 
r s fair value method negatively impacts our results of operations 
the future impact of adoption of statement no 
r will depend on the level of share based payments granted in the future  expected volatilities and expected useful lives  among other factors  present at the grant date 
however  had statement no 
r been effective in prior periods  the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of statement no 
as described in our disclosure of pro forma net income and net income per share in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
as of june   the unrecognized compensation expense associated with the remaining portion of the unvested outstanding awards was million million  net of tax 
statement no 
r also requires the benefit of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as previously required 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin describes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin will be effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal we are in the process of reviewing and evaluating fin  however  the impact of its adoption to our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows is not expected to be material 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
due to diversity in practice among registrants  sab expresses sec staff views regarding the process by which misstatements in financial statements are evaluated for purposes of determining whether financial statement restatement is necessary 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both the balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending after november   and early application is encouraged 
the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our results from operations or financial position 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 

sfas no 
provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
this standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas no 
applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
the standard does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  therefore  we expect to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal we do not believe sfas no 
will have a material impact on our results from operations or financial position 
on february   the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas no 
which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value ie  the fair value option  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards 
the election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability or upon entering into a firm commitment 
subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and is therefore effective for us in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently assessing the effect of implementing this guidance  which is dependent upon the nature and extent of eligible items elected to be measured at fair value upon initial application of the standard 
however  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks for foreign currency exchange rates and to a lesser extent for interest rates that could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we repaid all of our interest bearing debts during fiscal and interest rate risk applies only to our cash and short term investment portfolio 
to manage these risks  we regularly evaluate our exposure and  if warranted  may enter into various derivative transactions when appropriate 
we do not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we are not currently subject to significant market risks for commodity prices or other relevant market price risks 
foreign currency risk fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  principally with the us dollar versus the euro  canadian dollar and japanese yen  could impact our operating results 
it has not been our practice to actively hedge our foreign subsidiaries assets or liabilities denominated in local currencies 
operating income generated outside the united states as a percentage of total operating income was in  in and in in fiscal years   and  we recorded foreign currency translation gains of million  million and million  respectively 
during these years the foreign currency transaction gains were negligible 
in fiscal  a increase compared to fiscal in the us euro weighted average exchange rate increased net sales and net income by approximately million and million  respectively 
in the case of the us dollar versus the canadian dollar  a increase in fiscal compared to fiscal in the weighted average exchange rate increased net sales and net income by approximately million and million  respectively 
a change in the year to date weighted average euro exchange rate would have had the effect of increasing or decreasing net sales and net income by approximately million and million  respectively 
a change in the year to date weighted average canadian dollar exchange rate would have had the effect of increasing or decreasing net sales and net income by approximately million and million  respectively 
interest rate risk we place our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  which generally have a term of less than one year  with high quality financial institutions and have investment guidelines relative to diversification and maturities designed to maintain safety and liquidity 
as of may   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities totaling million 
if  during fiscal  average short term interest rates decreased by from fiscal average rates  based on our quarterly average balance of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  our projected interest income from short term investments would have decreased by approximately million
