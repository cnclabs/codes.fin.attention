item business general turbochef technologies  inc is a leading provider of equipment  technology and services focused on the high speed preparation of food products 
our user friendly speed cook ovens employ proprietary combinations of heating technologies  such as convection  air impingement  microwave energy and other advanced methods  to cook food products at speeds up to times faster than  and to quality standards that we believe are comparable or superior to  that of conventional heating methods 
we believe that one of our primary competitive advantages is the strength of our research and development capabilities and the breadth and depth of our portfolio of patents 
our staff of engineers has a long history of developing innovations in the foodservice industry 
our research and development focus combines the development of innovative cooking technologies with the commercialization of those technologies into finished products to meet specific market needs 
currently  we focus our efforts on the approximately billion annual worldwide commercial primary cooking equipment market with our three primary speed cook oven models  the c  the tornado and the high h batch 
the speed  quality  compact size  ease of use and ventless operation of our ovens provide significant advantages to a wide range of foodservice operators  including full and quick service restaurants  hotels  stadiums  convenience stores and coffee shops 
these customers increasingly value the ability to cook food in a quick and high quality manner with minimal employee training 
in addition  our ovens enable certain other customers to significantly broaden their foodservice offerings 
we believe the advantages of our technologies have been validated by the exclusive supply agreements we have been awarded to provide speed cook ovens to several of the most widely known food service brands 
we offer our customers a high level of product service and support via a centralized call center and a network of certified third party service technicians  which we believe significantly differentiates us from our competitors in the commercial cooking equipment market 
we currently sell our ovens through a broad sales organization that includes both internal direct salespeople as well as a broad base of manufacturer s representatives and equipment distributors 
in addition  we employ a flexible manufacturing model that relies on external suppliers of components for our ovens coupled with final assembly in our own facilities or through contract manufacturers as needed 
this attractive operating model provides a level of operating leverage and capital efficiency within our business 
in order to leverage our success in the commercial cooking equipment market  we have entered the approximately billion annual domestic residential oven market with the shipment of our first consumer model in early consumers increasingly value speed and convenience in home food preparation and continue to demand higher levels of quality and functionality in their kitchen appliances  resulting in a significant rise in recent years in the purchase of restaurant caliber kitchen appliances for the home 
we offer a double wall oven with an original and unique design and control system to bring commercial speed cook technology right into the home 
our first residential products target the premium segment of the residential oven market and are priced at a point that we believe is appropriate for a high end consumer purchase 
we expect to follow with a single wall version of the speed cook oven by the end of the year and with other configurations over time to most successfully satisfy all consumer needs in the kitchen for residential oven appliances 
our senior management team has a successful track record of improving operating results  building scale through organic growth and strategic acquisitions and enhancing stockholder returns  and it is dedicated to accomplishing these same things for the company 
since joining us in october  our senior management team has made notable progress in developing the speed cook market and positioning the company as the foremost player in that field 
a number of members of our management team have specific and significant experience in speed cook technology and the commercial foodservice industry in general 
since  we have seen the development of a tremendous relationship with the subway franchise restaurant system with our tornado ovens with approximately  units installed and continued meaningful sales each year 
the company believes that success has been a springboard to the development it has experienced of solid relationships as the exclusive provider of speed cook ovens to other well known brands 
the company now has a solid sales and marketing effort and operates its own production line out of our operations center in dallas  texas  which opened in the company has added to its strong technology base through acquisitions  including the acquisition of enersyst development center  llc enersyst and the acquisition of the assets of global appliance technologies global 
these strategic acquisitions will enhance our future product development capabilities 
in the company unveiled a working prototype of its first remarkable residential speed cook oven and was able to attract senior and experienced managers to our residential oven program 
assuming ovenworks  lllp  our majority stockholder  distributes its shares of our common stock to its limited partners  our executive officers collectively beneficially own approximately of our common stock  based on shares outstanding at september   strongly aligning their interests with those of other stockholders 
our technologies speed cook technologies combine various heat transfer technologies  such as hot air convection  air impingement  induction and microwave energy  to cook food significantly faster than traditional heating methods 
our research and development team works continuously to design and test new combinations of these and other cooking methods  and our speed cook technologies are the primary subject of our more than issued patents and patent applications worldwide 
through our acquisition of enersyst  we brought in an experienced group of engineer inventors and a robust portfolio of impingement and impingement microwave oven technologies that we are successfully applying in both our commercial and residential product lines 
we expanded our ownership of core speed cook technology further with our acquisition of the technologies of global 
these tactical moves will help us to continue to define speed cook technology applications today and for the future 
the core of the speed cook technology used in our currently available commercial ovens is a proprietary combination of high speed forced air convection and microwave energy or high speed forced air convection alone 
in our c and tornado models  a smooth flowing field of heated air is circulated within the oven at speeds of up to miles per hour to wrap the surface of food in a fast moving shroud of hot air  while the food simultaneously is cooked with precisely controlled bursts of microwave energy 
this system creates a unique set of temperature and moisture control conditions within the food that preserves and enhances flavor 
our high h batch oven uses our air impingement cooking system specially placed nozzles that force high velocity jets of heated air from above and below the food product to produce faster and more consistent cooking than conventional methods  but without microwave 
we are applying a combination of these same technologies to our residential oven product and to our newest commercial oven  the i  to be available early all of our commercially available ovens and the residential oven design include our patented system of scrubbing the circulating air using a catalytic converter 
heated air is circulated through the internal catalytic converter  instead of being vented outside the unit  as with a conventional oven  resulting in a ventless system 
our ovens employ this technology to cook food at high speeds with food quality we believe to be comparable  and in many instances superior  to both conventional methods and other speed cook methods 
in march the company announced its debut of a gas fired conveyor oven  its hhc  and showcased it at the international pizza expo the oven capitalizes on enersyst s technology roots and delivers pizza cook times easily reaching the three and a half minute mark  which the company believes is at least faster than any other competing oven on the market today 
it delivers this impressive performance while using only about half of the valuable kitchen floor space needed by the closest competing oven 
the small footprint was designed to fit virtually any application and avoid the energy losses and higher hvac needs of larger ovens 
the speed comes from a new and unique air handling design and techniques that create a more efficient  smoother air flow  which combined with its engineered nozzle design yield the highest heat transfer rates measured on any conveyor to date 
our commercial ovens employ a proprietary operating system  which incorporates our patented layered logic system of user controls 
this system allows for step by step  intuitive operation of the ovens via a digital touchpad  enabling users to easily specify one of up to as many as previously saved cooking profiles 
these memorized settings allow operators of varying culinary skill levels to easily cook a variety of menu items in a consistent  high quality manner 
in addition  our operating system allows users to create and save their own custom cooking settings 
this system also tracks and records selected cooking data  allowing a commercial operator to review cook times  production volume and other characteristics 
our commercial ovens also incorporate our chefcomm technology  which offers users the ability to upload and download menus from to their ovens through the use of readily available memory devices  such as smart cards and usb drives  and our proprietary software application 
this coupled with smart menu  our menu management system  enables foodservice chains to easily make changes to their menus for promotions and or new product offerings and have their new menus burned to low cost memory media and mailed to the operator s central location or to each individual location for a quick  consistent and cost efficient update 
some of our air impingement cooking system technologies  including those that employ a proprietary combination of air impingement and microwave energy  are the subject of licenses to third parties 
in addition to these commercially available technologies  we also have developed other proprietary speed cook technologies  incorporating various combinations of hot air convection  air impingement  microwave energy and other heating methods 
we continue to work towards refining and developing these technologies and to explore ways in which they can be used for commercial and residential applications 
our products and services our commercial ovens we have three primary commercial oven models currently available for sale  our c  tornado and high h batch ovens the turbochef c the c model uses a patented combination of high speed forced air convection heating and microwave energy to cook up to times faster than conventional methods 
the c bakes  browns  broils and roasts with food quality that we believe to be comparable or superior to that of traditional cooking 
the primary benefit of the c is its versatile capability to cook a wide spectrum of food  from dense proteins like filet mignon to delicate souffl s 
because it is certified by underwriter s laboratory ul to be operated in a ventless environment  the c does not require a hood  ventilation or a fire suppression system 
its preprogrammed  digital touchpad makes operation and training simple for any operator or chef 
the turbochef tornado 
our tornado oven has many of the same operational benefits as our c  but is specifically designed to cook  toast and brown sandwiches  pizzas  breakfast items  appetizers and similar food products 
the tornado combines our patented ventless speed cook technology with a conventional wire baking rack or stone and independently controlled infrared browning element to cook up to times faster than conventional methods with food quality that we believe to be comparable or superior to that of traditional cooking 
like the c  the tornado is ul certified to be operated in a ventless environment 
we believe the adoption of the tornado as their exclusive speed cook oven by several large and widely known restaurant and coffee shop brands validates the oven and its underlying technologies 
the turbochef high h batch 
in the high h batch oven  we applied breakthrough impingement technology in a batch oven as an efficient alternative to currently marketed commercial small conveyor ovens 
the high h batch oven also includes our patented ventless technology and bakes  browns and toasts with speeds up to twice that of tabletop conveyors and five times the speed of conventional equipment 
this model utilizes heated air only with no microwave  and it is particularly suited for fresh dough pizzas  pasta entrees and appetizers  and raw dough and batter based baked goods  and it can accommodate a full sheet pan 
we assemble our commercial ovens in our own assembly line at our facilities in dallas  texas  from parts and components sourced commercially 
we maintain relationships with third party assemblers who can augment our production capabilities as demand requires 
performance characteristics of our commercial ovens we believe the key performance characteristics of our c  tornado and high h batch ovens provide a unique value proposition to our customers 
these key performance characteristics include speed 
our c and tornado ovens cook up to and times faster  respectively  than conventional ovens  and each are capable of cooking diverse items together or consecutively with no lag time 
this capability results in significantly increased food throughput for users of our ovens 
our high h batch oven  applying an advanced version of the heated air impingement technology commonly found in conveyor ovens  but in a batch configuration in our oven  can double the speed of tabletop conveyor cooking  and it can cook up to times as fast as a conventional oven 
quality and versatility 
we believe that our ovens produce food that is comparable  and in many cases superior  in quality to conventional and other speed cook methods 
additionally  our ovens are able to bake  brown  broil or roast  allowing them to be used in a broad spectrum of venues  including fine dining establishments  quick service restaurants  hotels  movie theaters  concessions  convenience stores  coffee shops and bakeries 
ventless cooking 
during the cooking process  air in our speed cook ovens is circulated through an air scrubbing catalytic converter that breaks down fume and grease by products of food  enabling the ovens to operate without venting these by products into the air 
this ventless system eliminates the need for commercial kitchen hood systems  allows our ovens to be installed in almost any location  and significantly reduces flavor transfer and odor transfer between different products cooked together or consecutively in the oven 
ease of use 
our layered logic operating system allows for step by step  intuitive operation of our ovens via a digital touchpad  allowing users to easily specify one of up to as many as pre preprogrammed cooking profiles  depending on the oven model 
these memorized settings allow operators of varying culinary skill levels to easily cook a variety of menu items in a consistent  high quality manner 
in addition  our operating system allows users to program their own custom cook settings 
our chefcomm technology offers users the ability to upload and download menus to from their ovens through the use of readily available memory devices  such as smart cards and usb drives  and our proprietary software application 
this coupled with smart menu  our menu management system  enables foodservice chains to easily make changes to their menus for promotions and or new product offerings and have their new menus burned to low cost memory media and mailed to the operator s central location or to each individual location for a quick  consistent and cost efficient update 
our residential ovens we have taken our restaurant proven technology and adapted and expanded it to suit the needs of today s home cook through our double wall speedcook oven 
the residential product brings to the home the opportunity to prepare meals up to times faster than conventional methods leaving more time to spend with family and friends 
the secret to the oven s speed is turbochef s airspeed technology tm that includes heated air blown through the oven cavity at speeds up to mph  foods retain more moisture than when cooked in conventional ovens resulting in enhanced quality and flavor 
with a retro modern design and easy to use cookwheel tm and cook navigator tm control system  the turbochef double wall speedcook oven harnesses advanced technology within a warm  stylish frame that fits equally well in traditional and modern kitchen settings 
each turbochef model comes pre programmed with nearly cooking profiles that automatically determine the ideal cook time and temperature 
maintaining superior quality  the turbochef double wall speedcook oven cooks food evenly and thoroughly  locking in natural juices to retain more moisture and savory flavor 
while the upper oven employs turbochef s proprietary speed cook technology  the bottom cavity features a traditional convection oven  allowing this unit to serve as the ultimate appliance  catering to both state of the art and time honored culinary techniques 
cutting the cook time by up to allows consumers to spend more time savoring the preparation of the meal and enjoying it with friends and family 
a lb 
turkey that once took four hours now cooks in minutes in the turbochef oven 
a perfectly browned and juicy oz 
filet mignon in a grill pan drops from minutes  seconds  to minutes for rare  and minutes for medium rare 
a freshly prepared oz 
chocolate souffl can be baked to perfection in minutes 
future oven products we continue to develop new technologies and augment our existing technologies  and we are in various stages of development of new commercial ovens based on these technologies 
in march at the pizza expo turbochef introduced a gas fired high speed conveyor oven  currently named the hhc which can bake and toast food items up to faster than conventional conveyor ovens without compromising quality 
it delivers this impressive performance while using only about half of the valuable kitchen floor space needed by the closest competing oven 
the hhc utilizes the most advanced application of impingement air technology developed by our engineers 
the new and unique air handling design and techniques create a more efficient smoother air flow  which combined with its engineered nozzle design yield the highest heat transfer rates measured on any conveyor to date and allow for the oven s remarkable speed 
at the national restaurant association show in may  we introduced our newest commercial speed cook oven  the i the i is a combination air impingement microwave countertop batch oven that enables large batch throughput with uniform chef quality results  all at cooking speeds up to ten times faster than conventional ovens 
separately controllable upper and lower air allows for flexibility in cooking and top launched microwave permits the use of metal cookware 
these two new commercial products are targeted for delivery to customers in early the company also intends to begin offering a single wall version of our consumer speed cook oven by the end of the single wall oven will add flexibility of choice making our superior technology available to an even wider variety of consumer applications where there just is not room for a double wall unit 
licensing and technologies certain of our patented technologies gained through acquisitions in and are the subject of exclusive or non exclusive licenses to third parties who have produced  and may continue to produce  commercial ovens based on our technologies 
although we do not intend to continue to actively seek licensees for our technologies  these existing licenses will continue to provide a source of revenue for us until they expire or are terminated 
other products and services in addition to the primary products and services described above  we offer certain consumables related to our ovens  such as ceramic platters  cooking utensils and proprietary oven cleaners  and replacement parts for our ovens  in each case to support our customers use of our ovens

our industry commercial cooking equipment market according to the size and shape of the industry study conducted by the north american association of food equipment manufacturers nafem  the north american market for commercial primary cooking equipment including ovens  broilers  grills  toasters  and fryers is approximately billion annually 
the oven component of this market is approximately million annually 
nafem estimates that the annual global market for commercial primary cooking equipment is to times the north american market  or approximately billion 
this market is driven in large part by the trends and growth of the restaurant foodservice industry 
the national restaurant association nra estimates that domestic restaurant industry sales will reach billion in  an increase of over  marking the th consecutive year of real sales growth for the restaurant industry 
the nra defines the restaurant industry as all meals and snacks prepared away from home including all takeout meals and beverages  and includes both commercial and institutional foodservice providers 
over the past years  the restaurant industry has grown at a compound annual growth rate of 
according to the nra  sales at full service restaurants are projected to reach billion in  and sales at quick service restaurants are projected to reach billion in it is estimated that there are nearly  restaurant locations in the u 
s  including full service and quick service restaurants and operations where food is not the primary source of the operation s revenues  including convenience stores  lodging places  coffee shops  bars and taverns  recreation venues such as movie theaters and other institutions such as military and educational facilities 
the restaurant industry is projected to continue this growth primarily as a result of population growth and consumer desire for food quality and convenience 
consumer demand for convenience  speed and product quality is shaping foodservice and operating model trends  resulting in concept growth in new venues and specifically in the fast casual niche  a sub sector of the full service restaurant segment 
this continued industry growth drives foodservice equipment sales based on new location openings and remodelings  new venues and concepts  menu and operational modifications and equipment obsolescence 
several industry trends are anticipated to have a favorable impact on speed cooking  including the increasing demand by consumers for speed and convenience without a loss of food quality and the rapidly growing integration by foodservice providers of new technologies into their businesses in order to improve efficiency  throughput and consistency of product 
we believe that we are well positioned to benefit from the following equipment trends in the commercial cooking equipment industry as highlighted by foodservice operators according to a nafem survey multi functional  multi tasking equipment that fits in a small footprint  is easy to clean  and is fully mobile  energy efficient with minimal heat and fume emission  programmable via integrated memory storage devices or connected remotely by a modem  easy to train new employees to use  given high industry turnover rates and increasing number of non english speaking employees  improved quality of equipment service  and accelerated cooking using specialized heat concentration technology 
in addition  we believe that speed cook technology is further expanding the market for primary cooking equipment beyond domestic full service and quick service restaurants to include other domestic foodservice venues such as convenience stores  coffee shops  bars and taverns  stadiums  schools and movie theaters 
these other establishments now have the option to expand their food selection to encompass foods that previously took too long to cook for their time constrained customers  and foods that were previously cooked in a conventional microwave oven at the expense of the food s optimal flavor 
our speed cook ovens offer these other operations a cooking platform that provides an additional revenue source while requiring little  if any  additional investment in kitchen infrastructure  staff or training 
residential oven market we believe that the residential oven market represents a large  untapped opportunity for our business 
according to industry sources  the domestic oven market excluding microwaves is approximately billion annually  representing approximately million units 
the global market for residential ovens is approximately billion 
the domestic market for premium residential ovens has been growing at a rate faster than the overall residential oven market  which growth is driven by several trends  including consumer desire for speed and convenience in food preparation at home  increased demand for higher end kitchen equipment driven by increases in the size of the average american home  new home construction and remodeling trends  emergence of premium kitchen equipment as a status symbol  and increasing consumer comfort with using technology in virtually every part of their daily lives 
we believe that by leveraging the advantages of our speed cook technologies  including our high cooking speed and food quality and our user friendly operating system  as well as our marketing expertise  we are well positioned to capitalize on these market trends 
competition commercial cooking equipment market the speed cook oven sector of the commercial cooking equipment market is characterized by intense competition 
our speed cook ovens compete with conventional cooking systems  such as commercial ovens  grills and fryers  as well as equipment that cooks through the use of conduction  convection  induction  air impingement  infrared  halogen and or microwave heating methods or combinations thereof  sold by numerous well established manufacturers and suppliers 
in addition  we are aware that other industry participants are developing  and in some cases have introduced  commercial ovens based on speed cook methods and technologies 
our principal methods of competing in the commercial cooking equipment market are through our product performance  our research and development capabilities and our service and warranty offerings 
we do not believe there has been a significant introduction into the marketplace of any competitive products which are functionally equivalent to our cooking system ie  products that have the same capabilities to cook a variety of food items to the same high quality standards and at comparable speeds 
among our major competitors in the commercial cooking equipment market are amana commercial aga foodservice  duke manufacturing company  fujimak corporation  groen  inc dover corporation  merrychef and lincoln foodservice products enodis  llp  the middleby corporation  and vulcan hart corporation illinois tool works  inc 
we currently license certain technologies to some of these competitors who are currently producing  and may in the future produce  products that may be competitive with our speed cook ovens 
residential oven market we have recently begun sales of our residential speed cook ovens to consumers 
competition is growing in the emerging residential speed cook sector of the residential oven market 
however  we do not believe there are any speed cook products currently being sold in the residential oven market that possess the same combination of speed and quality as our new residential speed cook oven 
certain companies have introduced speed cook residential ovens  including the general electric advantium and trivection ovens utilizing microwave and halogen light technology  the whirlpool gmicroven tm speedcook appliance utilizing convection  microwave and halogen light technology and the amana lightwave tm utilizing microwave and infrared light technology 
regulation and accreditation we are subject to regulations administered by various federal  state  local and international authorities  such as the united states food and drug administration  the federal communication commission  the european community council and the japan ministry of international trade including those regulations limiting radiated emissions from our cooking system products  which impose significant compliance burdens on us 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements may subject us to civil and criminal sanctions and penalties 
we test our ovens  from time to time  in order to confirm continued compliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
we believe that compliance with these laws and regulations will not require substantial capital expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our future operations 
new legislation and regulations  as well as revisions to existing laws and regulations at the federal  state and local levels  in the united states and or in foreign markets  affecting the commercial foodservice equipment and residential oven markets may be proposed in the future 
such proposals could affect our operations  result in material capital expenditures  affect the marketability of our existing products and technologies and or could limit or create opportunities for us with respect to modifications of our existing products or with respect to our new or proposed products or technologies 
in addition  an expanded level of operations by us in the future could require us to modify or alter our methods of operation at costs which could be substantial and could subject us to increased regulation  and expansion of our operations into additional foreign markets may require us to comply with additional regulatory requirements 
we have received certification of our commercial ovens under ul accreditation standards relating to product safety and under the national sanitation federation accreditation standards regarding sanitation and the ability of our ovens to be cleaned 
our residential oven has satisfied the product safety standards required to mark them with the etl certification 
these agencies have established certain standards for a variety of categorized products and can be engaged to inspect a manufacturer s products for compliance with the applicable standards 
certification by each agency authorizes the marking of any such product with the agency s labels  which indicates that the product has met the applicable standards of the agency for such use 
such certifications  which require periodic renewal  only represent compliance with established standards and are not legally required 
however  failure by us to comply with these accreditation standards in the future could have a material adverse effect on our marketing efforts 
in addition  we have met the requirements necessary to apply the ce mark which indicates compliance with the european community council directive relating to electromagnetic compatibility and low voltage to our c  tornado and high h batch ovens 
as an equipment manufacturer  we are allowed to self certify compliance with this directive and we have had an independent third party  t v america  a leading technical service company  attest to the results 
we are required by law to meet this european community council directive in order to apply the ce mark and thereby sell our cooking systems in the european union 
employees as of september   we employed persons  including personnel providing technological support and development  manufacturing  sales  marketing  customer service  and finance and administration support 
none of our employees are represented by labor unions 
we consider relations with our employees to be good

item a 
risk factors as previously discussed  our actual results could differ materially from our forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed below 
these and many other factors described in this report could adversely affect our operations  performance and financial condition 
our historic stock option granting practices are the subject of an ongoing sec inquiry 
in february of  we were contacted by the sec in connection with their informal inquiry into the company s stock option granting practices for the period from to the present 
we have cooperated and continue to cooperate fully with the sec s investigation 
we undertook our own investigation and review under the oversight of our audit committee and with the assistance of outside legal counsel and forensic accounting experts  and we concluded that the measurement dates for financial accounting purposes for a number of stock option grants differed from the recorded grant dates for such awards 
because some of the prices at the originally stated grant dates were lower than the prices on the revised measurement dates  we incurred material amounts of stock compensation expense that were not recognized in our previously issued financial statements 
although we have addressed the restatement of financial information for those prior periods in this report  the filing of the restated financial statements and information does not resolve the sec s inquiry 
the sec may disagree with our accounting and reporting of the financial impact of the revised measurement dates  and there is a risk that we may have to further restate our prior financial statements  amend our filings or take other actions stemming from such an sec response 
the matters relating to the investigation of our stock option granting practices and the restatement of our consolidated financial statements may result in additional litigation and governmental enforcement actions 
our past stock option granting practices and the restatement of prior financial statements have exposed us to greater risks associated with litigation  regulatory proceedings  and government enforcement actions 
no assurance can be given regarding the outcomes from any future litigation  regulatory proceedings  or government enforcement actions relating to our past stock option practices 
if any litigation or government enforcement action is instituted against us  the resolution of such matter will be time consuming  expensive  and will distract management from the conduct of our business 
furthermore  if we are subject to adverse findings in litigation  regulatory proceedings  or government enforcement actions  we could be required to pay damages or penalties or have other remedies imposed  which could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
any regulatory action against us could cause us to incur significant expenses  and result in diversion of management resources 
we have incurred  to date  significant expenses relating to legal  accounting  tax  and other professional services in connection with the review of our stock option grant practices and the related restatement  and may incur significant expenses in the future with respect to such matters  which may materially adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
our senior management team and our audit committee have devoted a significant amount of time on matters relating to these investigations  as well as to our possible delisting from nasdaq and other regulatory inquiries  the restatement  and our outstanding periodic reports 
if our senior management is unable to devote an appropriate amount of time in the future to developing and attaining our strategic business initiatives and running our ongoing business operations because of the distraction of these other extraordinary matters  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected 
a de listing by nasdaq could adversely affect our stock price and marketability 
on march   we received a nasdaq staff determination letter stating that  as a result of the delayed filing of our form k for the year ended december   we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in marketplace rule c and were therefore subject to delisting from the nasdaq stock market 
on may  and august   we received additional nasdaq staff determination letters stating additional bases for delisting our securities from the nasdaq stock market because of our failure to file our forms q for the quarters ended march  and june  on june   the nasdaq listing qualifications panel granted our request for continued listing  subject to our filing this form k and any other required documents within certain time periods 
on august  we requested the panel to permit us more time to comply with the filing requirements and the panel has granted us an extension until september  with the filing of this form k and certain other reports  we believe that we have remedied our non compliance with marketplace rule c 
however  if the sec disagrees with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of past stock option grants  there could be further delays in filing subsequent sec reports that might result in delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq stock market 
if our common stock is delisted from nasdaq  our stock price could lose value and there may be little or no trading market for our common shares 
as a result of the delayed filing of certain of our periodic reports  we are ineligible to use form s for the registration of our securities for a period of time 
this may adversely affect our ability to engage in certain capital raising transactions 
as a result of our delayed filing of certain of our periodic reports  we will be ineligible to register our securities on form s for sale by us or resale by other security holders until we have timely filed all periodic reports under the securities exchange act of for a period of at least twelve calendar months 
in the meantime  we have the ability to use form s to raise capital or complete acquisitions 
the need to use form s  and the inability to use form s  could increase our transaction costs and adversely affect our ability to engage in certain types of corporate acquisition and capital raising transactions until we regain our s eligibility 
we are subject to review by taxing authorities  including the internal revenue service 
we are subject to review by domestic and foreign taxing authorities  including the internal revenue service 
we understand the irs intends to focus on issues relating to stock option grants 
although we have received no inquiry from any taxing authority  we believe the investigation of the company s stock option practices  the re measurement of various historic stock option grants and our handling of related tax issues may subject us to a higher risk of inquiry or audit with its attendant potential costs 
we may incur costs related to the application of irc section a to re measured stock options 
certain transition rules allow the company to remedy the penalties and other adverse tax effects on deferred compensation that arise under section a of the internal revenue code with respect to re measured stock options 
although we have not offered our option holders any remedy or other amelioration  we are considering doing so which may be under the transition rules mentioned above or otherwise 
the cost of available remedies or dispensations  while uncertain  could be significant 
we have a history of losses  we could continue to incur losses in the future  and we may never achieve sustained profitability 
although we were profitable during the fiscal year ended december   we had net losses of million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively  and our accumulated deficit as of december  was million 
our future results will be affected by our ability to grow our commercial sales and expand the commercial customer base  continue to reduce our product warranty charges  manage costs related to the residential product launch and capture meaningful market share after the residential product is launched 
we can provide no assurance that our future operations will be profitable 
we continue to expand rapidly  and we may be unable to manage our growth 
we intend to continue the rapid growth of our business  but we cannot be sure that we will successfully manage this growth 
continued growth could place a strain on our management  operations and financial resources 
there also will be additional demands on our sales  marketing and information systems and on our administrative infrastructure as we develop and offer new and additional products and enter new markets 
we cannot assure you that our operating and financial control systems  administrative infrastructure  outsourced and internal production capacity  facilities and personnel will be adequate to support our future operations or to effectively adapt to future growth 
if we cannot manage our growth effectively  our business may be harmed 
we have a long sales cycle that requires an extended sales effort and is difficult to predict 
a customer s decision to purchase our commercial ovens often involves a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process  and selling our commercial ovens often requires us to educate potential customers about the uses and benefits of our speed cook technology and services 
in addition  the integration of our ovens into a customer s business is often a company wide initiative  which can include the development of new menus and food products and the launch of new marketing and advertising campaigns 
these factors have made the sales cycles for our commercial ovens long  ranging from a few months to several years  making it difficult for us to predict when sales to potential customers may occur 
we may not be able to disclose the identity of our customers or potential customers and their oven orders 
we may not be able to disclose the identity of our existing and potential customers or any information about their plans for our products 
companies in the competitive restaurant and food service industry are secretive about their plans for new food concepts and expansion of menu items  and they usually do not approve of vendors disclosing information about equipment tests  orders or purchases that directly or indirectly expose their plans 
many also require that we enter into non disclosure agreements prohibiting us from disclosing such information 
we have an obligation to our stockholders not to risk the loss of new business because of our premature disclosure of the plans of our customers or potential customers against their wishes or in violation of our contractual commitments 
our inability to disclose this information could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock 
because the market for our commercial ovens is an emerging sector of the commercial cooking equipment market  we will be required to undertake significant marketing efforts to achieve market acceptance  the success of which we cannot predict 
the market for our commercial ovens is a nascent sector of the commercial cooking equipment market 
as is typical with new products based on innovative technologies  demand for and market acceptance of our commercial ovens are subject to a high level of uncertainty 
achieving market acceptance for our commercial ovens will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant funds to increase public awareness of our brand and our products  and to educate potential customers as to the distinctive characteristics and benefits of our products and our technologies 
there can be no assurance that our marketing efforts will result in significant market acceptance of our commercial ovens 
the success of our entry into the residential oven market is subject to the risks inherent in establishing a new business enterprise  and we cannot assure you that we will be successful in this endeavor 
an important part of our growth strategy includes the research  development and introduction of residential speed cook ovens 
historically  our expertise has been in the speed cook sector of the commercial cooking equipment market  and although we have developed technologies that at one time were being licensed for use in certain residential oven products  we have no prior experience in the production  marketing and sale of products in the residential oven market 
our entry into the residential oven market is subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise  and acceptance of our speed cook products in this market will depend upon our ability to  among other things  successfully create and develop demand for and market acceptance of our technologies in the residential oven market  market  promote and distribute our speed cook ovens and establish public awareness of our brand in the residential oven market  compete with the numerous  well established manufacturers and suppliers of conventional and speed cook ovens already in the residential oven market  and establish and maintain sufficient internal research and development  marketing  sales  production and customer service infrastructures to support these efforts 
although this new line of business is closely related to our commercial oven business  there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully enter this market 
we have and expect to continue to devote considerable resources and expenditures to this new line of business  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to be successful in this market 
if we cannot successfully build our residential oven business  our financial performance may suffer and our business may be harmed 
we are subject to risks associated with developing products and technologies  which could delay product introductions and result in significant expenditures 
we continually seek to refine and improve upon the physical attributes  utility and performance of our existing ovens and to develop new ovens 
as a result  our business is subject to risks associated with new product and technological development  including unanticipated technical or other problems and the possible insufficiency of funds allocated for the completion of development of a particular product or technology 
the occurrence of any of these risks could cause a substantial change in the design  delay in the development  or abandonment of new technologies and products 
consequently  there can be no assurance that we will develop oven technologies superior to our current technologies  successfully bring to market new commercial ovens  or develop and successfully commercialize a residential line of ovens 
additionally  there can be no assurance that  if developed  new technologies or products will meet our current price or performance objectives  be developed on a timely basis or prove to be as effective as products based on other technologies 
the inability to successfully complete the development of a product  or a determination by us  for financial  technical or other reasons  not to complete development of a product  particularly in instances in which we have made significant expenditures  could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
if we are unable to keep up with evolving technology  our products may become obsolete 
the market for our products and technologies is characterized by evolving technology 
we will not be able to compete successfully unless we continually enhance and improve our existing products  complete development and introduce to the market in a timely manner our proposed products  adapt our products to the needs and standards of our customers and potential customers  and continue to improve operating efficiencies and lower manufacturing costs 
moreover  competitors may develop technologies or products that render our products obsolete or less marketable 
we may not be able to compete effectively because our target markets are highly competitive  and some of our competitors have greater financial or technological resources 
both the speed cook sector of the commercial cooking equipment market and the residential oven market are characterized by intense competition 
we compete  and will in the future compete  with numerous well established manufacturers and suppliers of commercial and residential ovens  including manufacturers and suppliers whose ovens have been developed under licenses of our proprietary speed cook technologies 
we also are aware of others who are developing  and in some cases have introduced  new ovens based on other speed cook methods and technologies 
there can be no assurance that other companies do not have or are not currently developing functionally equivalent products  or that functionally equivalent products will not become available in the near future 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the products that we develop will be functionally superior to  or gain more commercial acceptance than  products currently being produced by third parties who have exclusive licenses to some of our proprietary technologies 
most of our competitors possess substantially greater financial  marketing  personnel and other resources than we do  and have established reputations relating to product design  development  manufacture  brand recognition  marketing and service of cooking equipment 
the use of outsourced manufacturing subjects us to potential disruptions in product supply and other potential adverse effects 
we do not maintain supply agreements with third parties for raw materials or components 
instead  we purchase these items pursuant to purchase orders in the ordinary course of business 
we attempt to maintain multiple sources of supply for these items  but some of the specially designed components used in our ovens are sourced from a limited number of suppliers 
we may utilize contract manufacturers to fabricate components and assemble our residential oven  and we may outsource fabrication and assembly of ovens  parts or components to foreign operations 
we are and will continue to be dependent on the ability of these third parties to  among other things  meet our design  performance and quality specifications  provide components and produce finished ovens in a timely manner 
events beyond our control could have an adverse effect on the cost or availability of raw materials and components 
shipment delays  unexpected price increases or changes in payment terms from our suppliers of components could impact our ability to secure necessary components  and could adversely affect the ability of our contract manufacturers to produce finished ovens for shipment to our customers 
additionally  if any of our contract manufacturers experience delays  disruptions  capacity constraints or quality control problems in its operations  or negatively changes the payment or other terms under which it agrees to assemble ovens for us  we may be unable to replace the lost manufacturing capacity on a timely and cost effective basis  product shipments to our customers could be delayed and we may experience an increase in our component part inventory levels 
the occurrence of any of these events would have a material adverse effect on our financial performance  competitive position and reputation 
depending upon supply from foreign countries also subjects us to various risks inherent in foreign manufacturing  including increased credit risks  tariffs  duties and other trade barriers  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  shipping delays  acts of terrorism and international political  regulatory and economic developments 
any of these risks could increase our costs of goods  interrupt our operations or have a significant impact on our foreign manufacturer s ability to deliver our products 
we may need additional capital to finance growth and to execute our business plan  and we may be unable to obtain additional capital under terms acceptable to us or at all 
our capital requirements in connection with the execution of our business plan  including our marketing and sales efforts  continuing commercial and residential product development and working capital needs  are expected to be significant for the foreseeable future 
in addition  unanticipated events could cause our revenues to be lower and our costs to be higher than expected  resulting in the need for additional capital 
historically  cash generated from our operations was not sufficient to fund our capital requirements  and we relied upon proceeds from sales of our securities to fund our operations 
while we believe that our present capital  together with our bank credit facility  provides us the ability to execute our business plan  we cannot make assurances in this regard 
further  if we do not have sufficient funds available  or are unable to obtain capital necessary to meet our future requirements  we may be unable to fund the research  development and sale of ovens  and we may have to delay or abandon one or more aspects of our business plan  any of which could harm our business 
our financial performance is subject to significant fluctuations 
our financial performance is subject to quarterly and annual fluctuations due to a number of factors  including our lengthy  unpredictable sales cycle for commercial ovens  the gain or loss of significant customers  unexpected delays in new product introductions  level of market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  unexpected changes in the levels of our operating expenses including increased research and development and sales and marketing expenses associated with new product introductions  competitive product offerings and pricing actions  and general economic conditions 
the occurrence of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our operating results and the price of our common stock 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile and difficult to predict and may continue to be volatile and difficult to predict 
the market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile in the future 
the market price of our common stock will be affected by  among other things variations in quarterly operating results  potential initiation and subsequent changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets  changes in accounting standards  policies or interpretations  other developments affecting us  our industry  clients or competitors  and  the operating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us 
any of these factors could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock on the nasdaq stock market  make it difficult to predict the market price for our common stock and cause the value of your investment to decline 
we rely heavily on our senior management team and the expertise of management personnel 
our operations will depend for the foreseeable future on the efforts of our executive officers and our other senior management to execute our business plan  and any of our executive officers or senior management can terminate his relationship with us at any time 
our business and prospects could be adversely affected if these persons  in significant numbers  do not perform their key roles as expected  or terminate their relationships with us  and we are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements 
many of our senior executive officers have limited prior experience in our industry 
many of our senior executive officers have limited experience in operating a business in our industry  and there is no guarantee that these persons will fully develop the necessary expertise to successfully execute our business plan 
the failure of these senior executive officers to fully develop this expertise would have a significant impact on our ability to compete in this industry and to operate our business effectively 
our chairman controls a significant interest in our common stock and may cause the shares to be voted in ways with which you may disagree 
as of september   ovenworks  lllp owns  of record   shares of our common stock  representing approximately of our outstanding common stock 
the sole general partner of ovenworks is oven management  inc richard e 
perlman  our chairman  is the sole stockholder  sole director and president of oven management  inc and also is a limited partner of ovenworks 
ovenworks will be able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may also delay or prevent a change in control of us even if beneficial to our stockholders 
the exercise of options or warrants will result in dilution to you 
at september   million shares of our common stock were subject to issuance upon exercise of outstanding stock options   shares of our common stock were subject to issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants  and  shares were subject to issuance upon vesting and payout under outstanding restricted stock units 
your ownership will be diluted by the exercise of any of these outstanding stock options and warrants and the vesting and payout of the restricted stock units 
we may not realize the potential benefit of our patents  trademarks and other intellectual property 
there can be no assurance as to the breadth or degree of protection which existing or future patents  if any  may afford us  that any patent applications will result in issued patents  that our patents  pending patent applications  registered trademarks or service marks  pending trademark applications or trademarks will be upheld if challenged or that competitors will not develop similar or superior methods or products outside the protection of any patent issued to us 
there can be no assurance that we will have all of the resources necessary to enforce or defend a patent infringement or proprietary rights violation action 
we also rely on trade secrets and proprietary know how and employ various methods to protect the concepts  ideas and documentation of our proprietary technologies 
however  those methods may not afford complete protection and there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar know how or obtain access to our know how  concepts  ideas and documentation 
if our products or intellectual property violate the rights of others  we may become liable for damages 
if any of our existing or future products  trademarks  service marks or other proprietary rights infringe patents  trademarks  service marks or proprietary rights of others  including others to which we have exclusively licensed some of our proprietary cooking technologies  we could become liable for damages and may be required to modify the design of our products  change the name of our products or obtain a license for the use of our products 
there can be no assurance that we would be able to make any of these modifications or changes in a timely manner  upon acceptable terms and conditions  or at all 
the failure to do any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect upon our ability to manufacture and market our products 
our business subjects us to significant regulatory compliance burdens 
we are subject to regulations administered by various federal  state  local and international authorities  including those administered by the united states food and drug administration  the federal communications commission and the european community council 
these regulations impose significant compliance burdens on us and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with such regulations 
failure to comply with these regulatory requirements may subject us to civil and criminal sanctions and penalties 
moreover  new legislation and regulations  as well as revisions to existing laws and regulations  at the federal  state  local and international levels may be proposed in the future affecting the foodservice equipment industry 
these proposals could affect our operations  result in material capital expenditures  affect the marketability of our existing products and technologies and or limit opportunities for us with respect to modifications of our existing products or with respect to our new or proposed products or technologies 
in addition  expansion of our operations into new markets may require us to comply with additional regulatory requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with additional applicable laws and regulations without excessive cost or business interruption  and failure to comply could have a material adverse effect on us 
a product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage  or an inability to acquire insurance at commercially reasonable rates  could have a material adverse effect upon our business 
we are engaged in a business which could expose us to various claims  including claims by foodservice operators and their staffs  as well as by consumers  for personal injury or property damage due to design or manufacturing defects or otherwise 
we maintain reserves and liability insurance coverage at levels based upon commercial norms and our historical claims experience 
however  a material product liability or other claim could be brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage  or could not be covered by our then existing insurance 
additionally  a material product liability or other claim could be brought against us that damages the reputation of our technologies or products in the market 
any of these types of claims could have a material adverse effect upon our business  operating results and financial condition 
an increase in warranty expenses could adversely affect our financial performance 
we offer purchasers of our ovens a one year limited warranty covering workmanship and materials  during which period we or an authorized service representative will make repairs and replace parts that have become defective in the course of normal use 
we estimate and record our future warranty costs based upon past experience 
future warranty expenses on the one year warranty  however  may exceed our warranty reserves  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance

in reaction to this inquiry and to respond to the sec s information requests  the company s management  under the oversight of the audit committee of the board of directors  began to conduct a comprehensive review of the company s stock option grants and practices 
the company engaged an investigative team the investigative team consisting of outside legal counsel experienced in these matters  as well as deloitte financial advisory services serving as forensic accounting experts and kroll ontrack  performing computer forensic collection services  who were each engaged by our outside legal counsel 
the audit committee also engaged its own separate legal counsel 
two members of the audit committee have served on our compensation committee at all times since october these directors recused themselves from any participation in matters relating to the historic performance of the compensation committee 
as a result of the findings of the review by the investigative team  as well as our internal review  our management has concluded  and the audit committee of the board of directors agrees  that the measurement dates that the company used for financial accounting purposes and pro forma disclosure purposes for various stock option awards made over the entire review period differ from the measurement dates that should have been used under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb for those grants 
measurement dates are dates at which  for accounting purposes  one compares the exercise price at which an option is awarded against the fair market value of the underlying shares of stock at the measurement date  as determined under apb and applicable interpretative guidance related thereto 
if the exercise price awarded is less than the fair market value of the shares at the time of grant  as determined under apb  then the issuer of the stock option award is subject to a compensation charge for any discount that results 
the company found in its review that certain awards had an exercise price less than the market price of the shares on the revised measurement date  and the company had not reflected the resultant compensation charges in its financial results 
accordingly  we are recording net additional non cash  stock based compensation expense of million  over the thirteen year period from the company s initial public offering through the present  with regard to past stock option grants net of forfeitures related to employment terminations  and we are restating previously filed financial statements for years ended december  and in this form k 
by the end of  in response to the requirement of sfas r for the company to begin expensing stock options the next year  the company suspended the use of stock options as a type of equity award under its employee stock incentive plan  and no new stock options have been issued since the end of that year 
in addition  the company accelerated the vesting of all outstanding stock options by the end of to minimize future compensation expense that the company would otherwise recognize in its consolidated statements of operations upon the effectiveness of sfas r 
the determination of appropriate measurement dates  especially in the context of a historical review  is subject to complex factual  analytical and judgmental factors 
alternate approaches to those used could have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those recorded in the restatement 
the determination by management of the appropriate measurement dates for the stock option grants was based upon the best available information  including the input from the outside legal and accounting experts conducting the review 
where we had incomplete documentation  we considered all available relevant information to determine the first date on which all stock option terms were fixed 
as described later in this explanatory note  where evidence necessary for a determination of the appropriate measurement date under apb was wholly lacking  we estimated compensation charges or a range of possible compensation charges through certain statistical analyses 
we believe that the approaches we used to determine or  in some cases estimate  appropriate measurement dates for historic stock option grants were the most appropriate under the circumstances 
the review initially considered two distinct periods january  through october  the pre change of control period  and the period subsequent to october  the post change of control period 
during the review process  the investigative team also determined that it was appropriate to review grant events from the company s initial public offering in until january  accordingly  the review period and the pre change of control period were re defined to also include these periods 
while the review of grant events was not as extensive as it was for the remainder of the review period  we believe it included sufficient detail to determine compensation expense for that period  which is reflected in the restated stockholders equity 
the review encompassed approximately individual grants made during the review period and included analysis of more than  pages of documents  including e mails and other electronic documents  and interviews of current and former directors  officers  and employees 
substantially more documentation  and all of the management personnel involved  for the post change of control period were available to the investigative team reviewable records were less available for the pre change of control period  and not all of the members of senior management during the earlier periods could be interviewed 
results of the review the company has completed the investigation and analysis of its option grants and processes during the review period 
the audit committee accepted factual findings and recommendations of the investigative team and made certain additional findings and recommendations 
these findings and recommendations were then presented to our board of directors which has accepted the findings and directed that the recommendations be implemented 
the key findings of the investigative team and the audit committee for each of the post change of control period and the pre change of control period are summarized below 
current management of the company in the post change of control period includes no one from the previous period 
one current member of the board of directors was also a member of the board of directors of the company for a period of time during the pre change of control period 
key findings related to post change of control period current management the audit committee does not believe that the evidence reviewed establishes intentional misconduct on the part of any current member of senior management or director  and the audit committee retains confidence in the integrity of these individuals 
the audit committee believes that it received the full cooperation of the company s current senior management and directors 
the audit committee recognized in its findings the absence of administrative infrastructure that prevailed at the time of the october  change of control 
nonetheless  the audit committee found that the company s and management s administration of its stock option program was marked by errors  poor administrative practice and a failure to understand or properly apply applicable accounting principles 
the company is reporting that the current chief financial officer has determined to leave that position and will be transitioned to another role at the company by year end other key findings include the following the investigative team found that the company did not have an established and consistent policy or practice for granting stock options 
for example  i new employees generally received stock options on or around their start dates or batched with other stock option grants  ii grant dates for new employees were often inconsistent with start dates reflected in offer letters  payroll and personnel records and regulatory filings  iii certain grants reflected transactions with inconsistent documentation or documentation approved subsequent to the grant date  iv in most cases  there was insufficient documentary evidence of board of directors or compensation committee approval of the specific grant terms on or before the grant dates  v management granted some options to employees prior to the delegation of authority from the compensation committee being formalized and documented in may the compensation committee subsequently approved all such grants  and vi certain new employees received stock option grants prior to the board of directors formal adoption of the company s applicable stock option plan 
the investigative team found that a statistical analysis of average forward returns on grant dates versus non grant dates did not suggest a stock option backdating practice by current management 
the investigative team found that the board of directors delegated authority to senior management to grant up to million stock options in connection with the change of control transaction in october  and evidence suggested a decision by management to grant options to each director and employee at the fair market value on the date of the change of control  but the company failed to finalize the determination of fair market value and exercise price until shortly after the grant date  and the allocation of options to certain employees was not finalized on or before the grant date 
the actual stock option plan pursuant to which the stock options were granted was not formally approved by the board until on or about december  although evidence suggested certain directors were informally designated as board members prior to grant dates for certain of their stock options  these grants were made prior to formal appointment to the board or acceptance of the appointment 
stock options were also granted to certain directors for service on board committees prior to their formal appointment to the committee or  in one instance  prior to the creation of the committee itself 
formal approval of stock option grants associated with board committee service was not obtained until january the investigative team found that of senior management  only one executive officer  three other non executive officers and no directors exercised stock options granted during the post change of control period 
the investigative team found that with respect to one grant to an administrative employee  the number of stock options was increased subsequent to the grant date 
the investigative team found that with respect to one grant to an executive officer and two grants to employees  stock options were granted prior to their formal employment dates 
the investigative team found that with respect to one grant to an executive officer and five grants to employees  evidence suggested that grant dates and exercise prices were modified subsequent to the recorded grant dates  but it was unclear whether the modifications were intended to capture a lower exercise price 
the investigative team found that with respect to one annual grant to two executive officers and certain employees  there was insufficient evidence that the allocation of stock options was complete on or before the grant date 
the investigative team found that certain consultants received stock option grants prior to the date of formal board approval  but it was unclear when the terms of the grants were finalized 
the audit committee accepted the investigative team s recommendation to revise measurement dates for certain stock options  resulting in those options effectively having been granted in the money and the company having not disclosed or accounted for the grants as such and having understated reported compensation expense in financial statements and related periodic reports for the fiscal periods covering the last calendar quarter of through the end of calendar year when the company ceased granting stock options 
the investigative team also found that the board had responsibility for approving stock option grants during the post change of control period 
the board formally delegated that authority to the company s compensation committee in december  and the committee in may formally delegated authority to the chief executive officer and chairman to grant stock options to non executive officers and employees 
neither the board nor the compensation committee were involved in the logistics of stock option grants  and neither detected grants that deviated from the terms of the stock option plan  including grants with exercise prices below fair market value due to incorrect measurement dates 
on certain occasions for grants requiring its approval  the board or compensation committee executed resolutions approving those grants significantly after the grant date 
the audit committee found that the governance practices at the company should be strengthened 
the audit committee has recommended a lead director should be designated i to promote the continuing improvement of the company s governance practices  ii to spearhead an assessment of the optimum composition of the board and its committees from a governance standpoint  and iii to institute a review to assure that the professional advice provided to management and the board in compensation and governance matters is fully adequate 
the investigative team also made a number of recommendations for improvements in procedures and administration of equity grants generally and stock options  should the company grant them again in the future  as well as recommendations regarding corporate governance and internal controls 
these recommendations were accepted by the audit committee and the board of directors has directed that they be implemented 
key findings related to pre change of control period prior management the audit committee accepted the investigative team s factual findings with respect to the pre change of control period 
these findings include the following there is evidence that certain former members of management and of the board of directors at the time determined grant dates and exercise prices in hindsight for certain stock option grants by i apparently selecting grant dates in hindsight to obtain more favorable exercise prices within a particular range of dates  and ii apparently re pricing certain grants in hindsight based  in some cases  on the lowest closing market price within a particular range of dates to attain lower exercise prices 
there is evidence that certain employees and one director were granted stock options prior to their start dates or election to the board 
stock option terms were modified subsequent to certain grant dates 
the company s stock option grant practices did not comply consistently with the company s applicable stock option plan 
board actions by written consents of all directors in lieu of a meeting unanimous written consents or uwcs were prepared  approved and executed significantly after the date indicated on the documents 
documentation for many grant events is incomplete or missing from the company s records 
the documentary evidence suggests that certain members of management and the former board  serving at various tenures  were involved or may have been aware of the retrospective selection of certain grant dates and or modifications to stock option amounts subsequent to the recorded grant date 
it is unclear whether these individuals were aware of the accounting implications or accounting treatment of the stock option grants at issue 
in addition  based on the foregoing  the audit committee found that the review suggested that the one current director of the company who at various times was on the company s board during the pre change of control period may have been aware of the retrospective selection of grant dates and modifications of grant terms with respect to grants he received during that period  but the committee does not believe he understood the accounting consequences of those actions 
the audit committee therefore concluded that the evidence did not establish that the director engaged in intentional misconduct 
the company understated its reported compensation expense for the pre change of control period because of the improper measurement dates selected for certain options  and the company granted in the money options without disclosing or accounting for them as such 
analysis of specific grants post change of control period current management grants of stock options in the post change of control period give rise to million of the additional stock based compensation expense 
during the post change of control period  grant events subject to revised measurement dates related to i the change of control transaction in october  ii a may award to an executive officer in connection with his assumption of increased responsibilities  iii a may grant of options to certain key employees in the only broadly based grant of options since the change of control transaction  iv a may grant of options to a newly hired executive officer  and v new employee hires 
a summary of these grants  based upon the findings of the investigative team is outlined below 
change of control transaction grants 
a majority of all options granted to officers and directors occurred in connection with the company s october private placement of preferred stock to a group of investors which effectively transferred a controlling interest in the company 
in connection with the change of control  new management and a new board of directors were installed  and plans had been publicly announced that the company would reserve million shares of common stock for issuances of options to the officers  directors  employees and consultants of the company 
the private placement closed on october  at an as converted price per common share of 
options on approximately million shares million to officers and directors were granted as announced in connection with the change of control 
the options were issued with an indicated grant date of october  and an exercise price of  a price substantially in excess of the price paid by investors in the change of control transaction 
the exercise price  however  was not finalized until shortly after october in addition  the company determined that formal board approval of the allocation schedule fixing the list of the recipients of the options and the number of shares for each was not finalized until on or about december   the date appearing on the last faxed signature to the uwc 
as a result  the company has determined in the review that the documentation of the october award was deficient to support an october grant date and that december  should be used 
using december as the measurement date under apb  the fair market value of the company s stock is deemed to be the last closing price before december  or per share  resulting in compensation expense of million 
of that amount million resulted from options granted to executive officers and directors 
additionally  until the board ratified the grant of  options to certain directors as compensation for board and committee service on january   there was no documentary evidence found that certain directors were formally appointed to a committee on or before the original october  grant date of their options for committee service or  in one instance  that the committee was formally created on or before the original grant date 
based on the review  the company determined that those grants should be re measured to the later date of ratification 
the new measurement date fair market value of the company s shares was per share  resulting in additional compensation expense of  under apb additional executive officer grant 
on one occasion in may an executive officer was granted options in connection with his assumption of expanded responsibilities in connection with an acquisition 
the options were documented as granted at the same time as options granted to new officers and employees being hired from the acquired company 
the uwc listing the executive s options and documenting the ratification by the compensation committee of his grant was not fully signed until eighteen days later 
from the review  the company determined that the proper measurement date under apb for this grant was the later signature date on the uwc which yielded a fair market value for the shares at an amount higher than the grant price applied to the award  resulting in additional compensation expense of  broadly based grant 
the company  at a board meeting in may  secured board approval for a broad grant of options to certain key employees  including officers 
however  it appears from the review that the specific allocation of the awards by name to each key person who received an option grant was not finalized until six days later when the last compensation committee member signed the uwc consenting to the allocation list 
the company determined that the proper measurement date under apb should have been the date documentation indicated the allocation was approved by the compensation committee  the date of the last signature of the committee members  and it is re measuring that grant to that date 
the new measurement date yields a fair market value for the shares at an amount higher than the grant price applied to the award  resulting in additional compensation expense of  of that amount  resulted from options granted to executive officers 
new executive grant 
a grant made to a newly hired executive officer in was pre approved by the compensation committee prior to his start date 
because this officer was being hired in connection with the creation of a new business unit representing a new direction and potential significant investment for the company  and because the board was holding a meeting around the time the new executive was joining the company  the compensation committee chairman requested that the officer s compensation package be considered by the entire board at the board meeting 
for that grant  the measurement date was originally established by the company as of the date of the full board approval 
from the review  the company determined  based on the relevant factors  that the officer s employment start date  which was approximately one week prior to the board meeting  fixed the proper measurement date and that the subsequent full board action and documentation of the award as of the meeting date resulting in a lower price was a re pricing of the grant making it a variable award which requires that compensation cost be adjusted to intrinsic value each reporting period 
the company has computed compensation expense in the amount of  as a result of the application of variable accounting 
new employee hires 
our practice prior to had been to grant stock options to all full time employees in connection with commencement of employment 
on many occasions  management would determine how many options an employee should receive and the award date to be used for documenting and pricing the option 
management would seek and receive final approval of such option awards from the compensation committee by ratification of the various awards in batches at a later time 
in the review  the company determined that awards of stock options to new employees were not documented as consistently being made on exact start dates  and approvals for many recorded grant dates for options were not consistently documented at the time of the grant  but rather the option certificates and the final approval actions of the compensation committee lagged the recorded grant dates by varying periods of time 
based on all available facts and circumstances from the review  the company determined that the originally recorded measurement dates for option awards made to many employees during the post change of control period from october through december were not the correct measurement dates under apb and that the dates of formal approval by the board and or the compensation committee should be the measurement dates 
using the various new measurement dates determined in the review  as generally described above  and after accounting for forfeitures  we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering million shares of common stock resulting in incremental stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms 
pre change of control period prior management grants of stock options in the pre change of control period gave rise to approximately million of the additional stock based compensation expense 
as previously indicated  the company  as part of the review  expanded the pre change of control period by conducting a more limited review of an additional individual grants from the company s initial public offering to december  which consisted of all grant events during such period 
that review led to re measurements of option grants giving rise to approximately million of additional stock based compensation expense 
this amount is included in the million noted above and has been recorded in shareholders equity in the restated financial statements 
in general  during the pre change of control period  the entire board  rather than a committee  made awards to officers  directors and employees 
grants were approved at meetings of the board or by action by uwc and were made in broad grants to groups of officers and employees at various times  selectively to individuals and small numbers of personnel at various times and in connection with beginning employment 
records for option awards during the pre change of control period were found in some cases to be missing or incomplete 
accordingly  option grants during the pre change of control period were addressed in the review under one of the following two categories those for which the investigative team found adequate records to enable the company to determine appropriate measurement dates  or for which there were some records  enabling the company to make a judgment about an appropriate measurement date  in each case based upon the best available information  and those for which little or no records were found to support a determination of an appropriate measurement date 
category one grants 
for option grants during the pre change of control period under the first category  there were several instances in which awards were documented as having been made  and were priced accordingly  on a date prior to the date documents in the company s records show formal corporate action making the grant was taken 
this appears to have been done  in the case of reporting persons  to make the grant date coincide with a specific event  such as the due date of applicable regulatory filings ie  form or form  the appointment or re election of a director or the purported date options were granted to non officers 
in many of these cases  we have determined that the correct measurement date is the date on which the board took the action to approve the grant 
however  we often had to make reasonable judgments based on the best available information about when the board took such action 
the review also identified instances in which awards to officers were made effective upon a future event  such as the commencement of employment and instances where the record suggests new employees were granted stock options prior to their start dates 
in these cases  we determined that the date of the future event is the correct measurement date for such grants 
the review also identified instances where stock option terms amount  expiration  etc 
were modified subsequent to grant dates  where documents indicate grant dates were selected in hindsight partly based on the timing of required form filings to obtain more favorable exercise prices  and where evidence suggests that members of the board and senior management re priced grants subsequent to the award to obtain a lower exercise price 
the selection of dates and prices in these instances appears to have been made in hindsight based on the lowest closing stock price within a particular range of dates 
in all instances where documents were available to indicate a different measurement date than the one apparently used  the grants were re measured 
in connection with the application of these measurement principles for option grants to officers and directors of the first category  and after accounting for forfeitures  the company has adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms 
re measurement of options of the first category covering million shares granted to non officers resulted in additional stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis over the awards vesting terms after accounting for forfeitures 
category two grants 
the company had insufficient or no documentation to review in connection with the second category of stock options granted during the pre change of control period 
accordingly  the company could not reach any conclusions about any required re measurements or compensation charges through a normal review or application of any methodology to limited documents 
instead  the company performed a sensitivity analysis on those grants where the selection of an alternative measurement date could have resulted in a compensation charge 
the sensitivity analysis was based on a computation of the minimum and maximum number of days between the grant date and the re measurement date for those grants in category ones with good or some information by classification of grantee consultant  director  executive  other 
the intrinsic value  if any  used to calculate the net compensation expense for category grants was determined by comparing the strike price of the grant to the average stock price between the minimum and maximum number of days after the grant date by classification of grantee 
based on this methodology  the company has adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering  shares of common stock resulting in incremental stock based compensation cost  net of forfeitures  of  on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms 
all of this amount was related to non officers 
the company believes that the foregoing analysis is a reasonable basis for recording additional compensation expense related to the category grants 
however  the sensitivity analysis was also extended to a computation of hypothetical compensation cost for these grants using the highest and lowest stock prices within the above described date ranges 
if the highest stock price in the date ranges by grantee classification were used the potential additional compensation expense is estimated at million 
conversely  if the lowest stock price in these same date ranges is used there is no additional compensation cost 
the company believes that the  it has recorded is appropriate for the additional compensation cost related to the category grants 
of this amount  relates to years prior to other matters compensation expense of  on a pre tax basis was also recognized  of which  related to the termination of a former officer 
the remaining amount was recognized as a result of non employee grants to consultants in exchange for services and other matters 
these grants were also fixed by management with subsequent final approval by the board or compensation committee  and new measurement dates were determined in the review based upon the later ratification actions giving final approvals except for two grants subject to counterparty performance conditions  which were remeasured until performance was complete 
to the extent we reasonably can  we intend to take actions to deal with certain adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of incorrectly priced options 
the primary adverse tax consequence is that incorrectly priced stock options vesting after december  that resulted in the employees receiving an exercise price at a discount from fair market value of the company s common stock on the date determined in the review to be the proper grant date for measurement purposes may subject the option holder to tax on unrealized gain and a penalty tax under irc section a and  as applicable  similar penalty taxes under various state tax laws 
we are currently evaluating the actions to be taken and the potential cost thereof 
we expect to incur future charges to resolve the adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of incorrectly priced options related to non section reporting persons  however  such amounts are not expected to be material 
the company continues to explore alternatives and has not concluded whether it will take any action related to the adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of incorrectly priced options related to section reporting persons and is under no obligation to make any such payments to these individuals 
in addition to any costs associated with resolving the adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by holders of the incorrectly priced options  the company may have obligations with respect to failure to withhold taxes on such employee exercises 
the company may incur certain penalties and related costs associated with the adverse tax consequences of incorrectly priced options and such amounts could be material 
if future payments are required  we believe the company has sufficient resources to make such payments 
additionally  approximately  of payroll taxes associated with certain exercises of options  which for payroll tax purposes were originally deemed to be incentive options but subsequent to re measurement are now deemed to be non qualified options  have not been recorded in the restatement due to immateriality 
all options granted in the pre change of control period and a significant portion of options granted in the post change of control period were originally deemed to be non qualified options 
summary of stock based compensation adjustments the additional stock based compensation expense was amortized over the vesting period relating to each option award  typically months in the pre change of control period  for which vesting was accelerated at the change in control  and months in the post change of control period 
as of december   the company changed its equity compensation programs to include acceleration of all unvested options as of december  and to cease awarding any more stock options 
consequently  of the expense being recorded is in years prior to fiscal the additional stock based compensation expense increased selling  general and administrative expenses in the affected periods 
the adjustments did not affect turbochef s previously reported revenue  cash and cash equivalents or net working capital balances in any of the restated periods 
the aggregate stock based compensation charge of approximately million recorded by the company resulted in no deferred income tax benefits as the company maintained a full valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets for the review period 
the incremental impact from recognizing stock based compensation expense and the cumulative effect on accumulated deficit resulting from the review of past stock option grants is as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year expense cumulative increase to accumulated deficit subtotal total additionally  we have restated the pro forma expense under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k to reflect the impact of these adjustments for the years ended december  and judgment many of the revised measurement dates for grants in the pre change of control period to october could not be determined with certainty  and we made judgments  as described above  to establish the revised dates based on the best information available 
judgments different from those used by us regarding the timing of the revised measurement dates would have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those recorded by us in the restatement 
we therefore prepared a sensitivity analysis to determine the hypothetical minimum and maximum compensation expense charge that could occur if different judgments to determine the revised measurement dates were used 
we provided a minimum and maximum range to the sensitivity analysis as a result of significant volatility in prices versus the revised measurement date prices 
in reviewing all available data  we considered other possible alternative grant dates for determining a sensitivity analysis  but were unable to find any such data or evidence that would provide an alternative measurement date we believed to be better than the one we selected 
we applied our sensitivity methodology on a grant date by grant date basis to examine the largest hypothetical variations in stock based compensation expense within a range of possible approval dates for each grant event 
the range of possible approval dates was developed for each grant after considering all available evidence for example  unanimous written consents  email dates  and board of director or compensation committee meeting dates 
for grants that had insufficient evidence to identify either an earliest possible measurement date or the latest possible measurement date or for category grants  both dates we based the range of possible measurement dates on a computation of the minimum and maximum number of days between the grant date and the re measurement date for those grants in category ones with good or some information by classification of grantee consultant  director  executive  other 
while we believe the evidence and methodology used to determine the revised measurement dates to be the most appropriate  we also believe that illustrating differences in stock based compensation expense using these alternative date ranges provides some insight into the extent to which hypothetical stock based compensation expense would have fluctuated if the available evidence had caused us to chose other dates 
after developing the range for each grant event by grantee category  we selected the highest closing price of our stock within the range and calculated the difference in stock based compensation expense to determine the maximum possible compensation expense 
we then selected the lowest closing price within the range and calculated the difference in stock based compensation expense to determine the minimum possible compensation expense 
if the low closing price was less than the closing price on the original date of grant  there was no resulting compensation charge 
we compared these aggregated amounts to the stock based compensation that we recorded 
if we had used the highest closing price of our stock within the range  our total restated stock based compensation adjustment relating to the revision in measurement dates would have been increased by approximately million 
conversely  had we used the lowest closing stock price within the range  our total restated compensation expense would have decreased by million 
our hypothetical ranges of stock based compensation expense were affected by the high level of volatility in our stock price and the date ranges used in our sensitivity analysis 
for example  in the year in our restatement period with the largest sensitivity range based on option grant date  our stock price closed at a low of per share and a high of per share during the range of potential alternative measurement dates 
in the year in our restatement period with the second largest sensitivity range based on option grant date  our stock price closed at a low of per share and a high of per share during the range of potential alternative measurement dates 
since we do not have evidence that the grant dates and exercise prices were selected on the date when our stock price was at its highest or lowest during each period  we concluded that selecting a revised measurement date on the highest or lowest closing price when measuring compensation expense would not have been consistent with the requirements of apb no 
 which looks to the first date on which the terms of the grants were fixed with finality 
the majority of option grants during this time period had some uncertainty related to the measurement date  therefore grants during such period were included in the sensitivity analysis 
the following tables set forth the effect on earnings before income taxes net of estimated forfeitures that would result from using different alternate measurement date determinations for the pre change of control period as compared to the measurement date selected in our evaluation and used for accounting purposes 
the first table  titled sensitivity analysis by option grant year illustrates actual pre tax stock based compensation expense and the hypothetical stock based compensation expense for this period based on the year each option in the restatement was granted 
the second table  titled sensitivity analysis by option vest year illustrates the actual amortization of the pre tax stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements and the hypothetical stock based compensation expense in the period that the options are earned

overview turbochef technologies  inc is a leading provider of equipment  technology and services focused on the high speed preparation of food products for the speed cook sector of the commercial cooking equipment market 
our user friendly speed cook ovens employ proprietary combinations of heating technologies such as convection  air impingement  microwave energy and other advanced methods to cook food products at high speeds with food quality that we believe to be comparable or superior to that of conventional heating methods 
we currently offer three commercial ovens the c oven  the tornado oven and  introduced in the second quarter of  our high h batch oven 
we are working to develop new ovens for the commercial cooking equipment market and to introduce speed cook ovens to the residential marketplace in early we currently derive revenue primarily from the sale of our ovens to commercial foodservice operators throughout north america  europe and australia 
in north america we sell our equipment through our internal sales force as well as through manufacturer s representatives 
in europe and australia we utilize a network of equipment distributors 
we are working to expand the market for our commercial ovens in latin america and asia 
we also derive revenues from licensing our technologies to food service equipment manufacturers 
prior to  we operated in one primary business segment 
in  the launch of our residential product line  planned for early  created an additional business segment 
we believe it is important to our success that we continue to sell to our existing base of commercial customers to meet their expansion or replacement needs  while at the same time to extend that customer base by concentrating our internal sales efforts on major foodservice operators and by supporting our networks of manufacturer s representatives and equipment distributors 
we must strive to do that while maintaining a cost structure for our products and controlling our operating expenses to provide a satisfactory return on sales 
we must compete effectively in the marketplace on the basis of price  quality and product performance  and we must meet market demand through development and improvement of our speed cook ovens and introduction of new oven products 
these same marketplace and product development factors will apply to our achieving success with the launch  planned for early  of our residential speed cook oven products  however  the residential market is new to us and there may be factors important to our success that are unknown to us at present 
see risk factors in section a of this annual report on form k 
our financial results in as compared to and reflect our efforts to strengthen our operating systems and infrastructure  solidify our sales and marketing efforts  continue to perform under our supply agreement with the subway system  expand our non subway customer base  integrate our global asset acquisition and develop our residential oven and market strategy 
sales to subway franchisees during the equipment rollout supporting their toasting initiative resulted in concentrated revenues and income in the quarters ended september   december  and  to a lesser extent  march  in  we substantially completed the initial rollout with delivery of ovens to international subway locations 
however  the subway relationship has and should continue to be a meaningful contributor to future revenues 
demand for equipment will continue from this major customer as new subway restaurants are opened and existing restaurants seek additional ovens 
in and continuing in  we focused our sales efforts on expanding our customer base  with the notable expansion plans of one major contract customer  the addition of several smaller new customers and progress with a number of other customer prospects 
during  we will continue to focus on generating revenues from other foodservice establishments  expanding our commercial products line  increasing the profitability of commercial products  introducing our residential oven products and developing enabling strategies 
the historical and results have been restated for the findings of our review of stock option grants and practices see the explanatory note immediately preceding part  item and note to the consolidated financial statements in this form k 
we have not amended  and do not intend to amend  any of our previously filed annual reports on form k and quarterly reports on form q for the periods affected by the restatement

we completed the rollout in the first quarter of subway sales accounted for  and of our total revenues during  and  respectively 
we expect subway to be a meaningful contributor to future revenues 
during  our non subway revenue increased million  or  over one other major customer accounted for of our revenue 
no other single customer accounted for more than of our total revenues 
we expect our non subway revenue to continue to increase in as our customer base continues to grow  we expect our customer concentration levels to decline 
during  we experienced a decrease in our cost of product sales as a percentage of revenue and an improvement in our gross margin percentage as compared to the improvement is primarily due to price increases implemented in and a reduction in warranty related charges related to having addressed a longevity and reliability issue in  offset somewhat by increases in component pricing 
in  we recorded a warranty charge of million related to our tornado ovens sold to subway 
in and  we experienced increases of and  respectively  in our tornado oven bill of materials due to increases in component pricing  primarily the result of increased stainless steel pricing 
additionally  we experienced increased freight and handling costs 
in  we expect gross profit percentages to improve as we anticipate no recurrence of product performance issues causing material warranty related charges  as we believe a favorable sales mix will result from continued expansion of our customer base and as we expect to address component part price increases by a continuous value engineering of our bills of material for all products 
during  we increased our research and development expenditures primarily as the result of our residential oven initiative 
in  we expect our research and development expenditures to approximate the levels as we develop additional residential and commercial products 
during  we recorded a million in process research and development charge in connection with resolution of certain contingencies associated with the acquisition of technology assets from global 
we had previously recorded a million in process research and development charge in at the time the acquisition was made 
during  we increased our selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding restructuring costs  depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation  by million over primarily due to costs related to our residential segment 
we expect an increase in  primarily due to increased marketing costs related to the residential product launch 
based on our analysis of the aforementioned trends and events  it is likely that we will continue to generate net losses on a quarterly basis during primarily due to our continued investment in the residential product launch coupled with the uncertainty as to market acceptance of this new product offering and the volume of sales that can be generated 
our future results will be affected by many factors  some of which are identified below and in section a of this report entitled risk factors  including our ability to increase our commercial revenue across our customer base  reduce our product warranty charges  manage costs related to the commercial business segment  successfully launch our residential product line  manage costs related to the residential product launch  manage costs related to the residential product launch 
as a result  there is no assurance that we will achieve our expected financial objectives 
application of critical accounting policies overview and definitions our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  cash flow and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates include those related to revenue recognition  warranty reserves  accounts receivable reserves  goodwill and other intangible assets  stock based compensation other equity instruments  income and other taxes  and contingent obligations 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates  and the impact of changes in key assumptions may not be linear 
our management has reviewed the application of these policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for a complete description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we define our critical accounting policies as those accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america that require us to make highly judgmental estimates about matters that are uncertain and are likely to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations as well as the specific manner in which we apply those principles 
our estimates are based upon assumptions and judgments about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made and require us to continually assess a range of potential outcomes 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales are recognized when no significant vendor obligation remains  title to the product passes depending on terms  either upon shipment or delivery  and the customer has the intent and ability to pay in accordance with contract payment terms that are fixed and determinable 
royalty revenues are recognized based on the sales dates of licensees products  and services revenues are recorded based on attainment of scheduled performance milestones 
certain customers may purchase extended warranty coverage 
revenue from sales of extended warranties is deferred and recognized in product sales on a straight line basis over the term of the extended warranty contract 
we provide for returns on product sales based on historical experience and adjust such reserves as considered necessary 
to date  there have been no significant sales returns 
deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
deferred revenue primarily consists of sales deposits  unearned revenue from extended warranty contracts and other amounts billed to customers where the sale transaction is not yet complete and  accordingly  revenue cannot be recognized 
product warranty we warrant our ovens against defects in material and workmanship for a period of one year from the date of installation 
anticipated future warranty costs are estimated based upon historical experience and are recorded in the periods ovens are sold 
periodically  our warranty reserve is reviewed to determine if the reserve is sufficient to cover the repair costs associated with the remaining ovens under warranty 
because warranty estimates are forecasts that are based on the best available information  claims cost may differ from amounts provided  and these differences may be material 
in  the company identified a potential longevity and reliability issue with the tornado oven 
the success of the toasting initiative implemented by subway  our largest customer  had resulted in higher use of the tornado oven and more cook cycles than anticipated 
we experienced increasing warranty calls from the subway installed base  as certain components degraded under the high usage much earlier than expected 
we determined that we could improve the longevity and reliability of the ovens through a change in the oven s software or operating system 
we incorporated the software change in production and launched a voluntary and proactive software upgrade program for installed units 
this program also included replacement of certain components in the ovens to ensure that the installed base of tornado ovens would benefit from the latest enhancements to the ovens 
for the year ended  we recorded a charge aggregating million or per share to increase the warranty reserve as our best estimate to address costs of warranty claims incurred  estimated future warranty claims  and the voluntary upgrade 
extensive engineering tests of the revised software provide evidence led us to believe that the longevity and reliability issue with subway s tornado ovens has been satisfactorily resolved 
at this time  we believe that  based upon historical data  the current warranty reserve is sufficient to cover the associated costs 
if warranty costs trend higher  we would need to record a higher initial reserve as well as reserve the estimated amounts necessary to cover all ovens remaining under warranty 
any such additional reserves would be charged to cost of goods sold and could have a material effect on our financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess purchase price of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations over their estimated fair values 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires goodwill and other acquired intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life no longer to be amortized  however  these assets must undergo an impairment test annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant 
in conjunction with change in segment reporting  we updated the goodwill impairment analysis and determined that the change did not impair the carrying amount of goodwill 
we also completed our annual goodwill impairment test in october and determined that the carrying amount of goodwill was not impaired  and there have been no developments subsequently that would indicate an impairment exists 
we will continue to perform our goodwill impairment review annually or more frequently if facts and circumstances warrant 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful life and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we are currently amortizing acquired developed technology and covenants not to compete using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of years 
stock based compensation and other equity instruments effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
sfas no 
r  using the modified prospective method 
sfas no 
r requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the grant date and recognition of compensation expense over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of stock option grants is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with the valuation techniques previously utilized for options in footnote disclosures required under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas no 
as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

the fair value of restricted stock awards is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date 
such fair values will be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period  net of estimated forfeitures  using the straight line method under sfas no 
r 
in december  in response to sfas r  the board of directors of the company  upon recommendation of its compensation committee  approved an acceleration of all unvested options granted to employees and directors under the company s stock incentive plan 
as a result of the acceleration  options to acquire approximately million shares of the company s common stock became immediately exercisable 
the decision to accelerate vesting of these options was made primarily to minimize future compensation expense that we would otherwise recognize in our consolidated statements of operations upon the effectiveness of sfas r 
as a result of the acceleration  we expected to reduce the stock option expense we otherwise would be required to record in connection with accelerated options by approximately million in  million in and  in in connection with the acceleration and in order to prevent unintended personal benefit to the holders of these options  the optionees agreed to certain restrictions on any shares received through the exercise of accelerated options 
these restrictions generally prevent the sale of stock obtained through exercise of an accelerated option prior to the original vesting date 
all other provisions of the original option grants remain 
employees who terminate prior to their original vesting date ostensibly receive a benefit from the acceleration of options measured by the differences in the estimated fair value of the options pre and post acceleration 
we estimate the benefit associated with possible future employee terminations is approximately  and  accordingly  recorded a one time non cash compensation charge in the fourth quarter of as a result of the acceleration 
see the explanatory note immediately preceding part of this form k for information regarding review of our stock option grants in prior periods and restatement of historical financial statements as a result of the findings 
we account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments issued based on the fair value of the equity instruments issued in accordance with sfas no 
and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
the two factors which most affect charges or credits to operations related to stock based compensation are the fair value of the underlying equity instruments and the volatility of such fair value 
we believe our prior and current estimates of these factors have been reasonable 
we account for transactions in which we issue convertible securities in accordance with eitf issues no

 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
during the year ended december   we issued  restricted stock units rsu to certain employees and non employee members of the board of directors 
these restricted stock units had a weighted average fair value of per unit and the aggregate fair value was  the fair value of these awards was based upon the market price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant 
 of these awards vest at the end of a two year period  with the remaining awards vesting over one  two and three year periods from the date of grant  provided the individual remains in the employment or service of the company as of the vesting date 
additionally  these shares could vest earlier in the event of a change in control  merger or other acquisition  or upon termination for disability or death 
the shares of common stock will be issued at vesting  or  in some cases  at a deferred payout date 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   include  recognized as stock based compensation expense for these awards 
as of december   there was  of unrecognized compensation cost related to these rsu awards  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
deferred income taxes in preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
in addition  as of december   we have net operating losses nols of approximately million  of which million are subject to annual limitations resulting from the change in control provisions in section of the internal revenue code 
these nols begin to expire in we currently have significant deferred tax assets  including those resulting from nols  tax credit carryforwards and deductible temporary differences 
we provide a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 
management weighs the positive and negative evidence to determine if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed is difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in past years 
despite our profitability in and our future plans and prospects  we have continued to maintain a full valuation allowance on our tax benefits until profitability has been sustained over a time period and in amounts that are sufficient to support a conclusion that it is more likely than not that a portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
a decrease in our valuation allowance would result in an immediate material income tax benefit  an increase in total assets and stockholder s equity  and could have a significant impact on earnings in future periods 
loss contingencies we define a loss contingency as a condition involving uncertainty as to a possible loss related to a previous event that will not be resolved until one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
our primary loss contingencies relate to pending or threatened litigation 
we record a liability for a loss contingency when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
when we believe the likelihood of a loss is less than probable and more than remote  we do not record a liability but we disclose material loss contingencies in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we make these assessments based on facts and circumstances and in some instances based in part on the advice of outside legal counsel 
enersyst acquisition on may   we acquired enersyst development center  llc enersyst  a leading provider and source of innovations to the foodservice industry 
historically  enersyst researched  developed and licensed its proprietary foodservice technologies to foodservice equipment manufacturers  and provided fee based consulting services to members of the foodservice industry to test and develop products for the foodservice market 
enersyst holds more than issued patents and patent applications worldwide related to heat transfer  air impingement and associated food technologies 
as a result of this acquisition  we believe we are better positioned to deliver the most advanced speed cook equipment  technology and services to customers worldwide 
the results of enersyst s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the acquisition date 
total consideration for this transaction  million  consisted of million cash  including transaction costs  and million equity in the form of enersyst preferred membership units exchangeable in the future  at the discretion of the holders  for approximately  shares of our common stock 
as of december   approximately  shares have yet to be exchanged 
the cash portion of the acquisition was funded by a may private placement of common stock 
total goodwill recorded was million  none of which is deductible for income tax purposes 
purchase of patent and technology assets and research and development on september   we entered into an asset purchase agreement the purchase agreement with global appliance technologies  inc global and stockholders of global 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we acquired the patent and technology assets of global further expanding our ownership of proprietary commercial and residential speed cook technologies 
these technologies will allow us to enhance our products with additional or different features as well as enable us to expand the range of product offerings 
at the closing of the transaction  global received million in cash and  shares of the company s common stock with a value of  at the date of acquisition 
additionally  the company entered into services agreements with the principals of global which provided  among other things  for delivery of three patent applications by the end of the first year  and two additional patent applications by the end of the eighteenth month following closing 
upon timely delivery of these patent applications  the company was obligated to pay global three nearly equal installment payments totaling million  payable on each of the first three anniversaries of the closing date the payments will be made in cash and in stock 
in september  all of the patent applications required under the terms of the agreement were delivered 
the transaction was accounted for as an asset acquisition 
the aggregate consideration for the assets acquired is comprised of million  including transaction costs  given at closing and million for the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration which became payable upon delivery of the patent applications 
the million for contingent consideration includes million  the estimated fair value of  shares of common stock issued as part of the first installment  and million  the estimated fair value of the two remaining installments 
the company allocated the consideration for these technology assets to in process research and development iprd and expensed million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
amounts allocated to iprd include the value of products in the development stage that are not considered to have reached technological feasibility or to have alternative future use 
accordingly  this item was expensed as research and development in the consolidated statement of operations for the quarter ended september   upon the completion of the asset acquisition 
technology development and iprd were identified and valued by an independent valuation firm through extensive interviews  analysis of data provided by global concerning development projects  their stage of development  the time and resources needed to complete them  if applicable  and their expected income generating ability and associated risks 
no development projects had reached technological feasibility  therefore  all the intangible assets were deemed to be purchase of iprd 
the income approach  which includes an analysis of the cash flows and risks associated with achieving such cash flows  was the primary technique utilized in valuing acquired iprd 
key assumptions for iprd included a discount rate of and estimates of revenue growth  cost of sales  operating expenses and taxes 
the purchase allocation is based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to change based on completion of the final valuation 
any changes could be material to our consolidated statement of operations 
in connection with this transaction  we also entered into restrictive covenant agreements the restrictive covenant agreements with each of the two principals of global 
under the restrictive covenant agreements  the principals agreed to certain covenants regarding the disclosure of trade secrets and confidential information  and to covenants restricting their ability to compete with us 
as consideration for these covenants  each principal received million in cash at closing  and each can receive additional cash payments totaling million  which are payable in equal portions on the first three anniversaries of the closing date 
the estimated fair value of these agreements  million  will be amortized over the agreements ten year term 
results of operations revenues we currently derive all sales  cost of product sales and gross profit from our commercial segment 
total revenues decreased  or million  to million for as compared to million for total revenues decreased million for  from million for the fluctuation in total revenues from to is attributable to the initial system wide rollout of our tornado model oven to subway franchisees which commenced in and was completed in the decrease in total revenues for as compared to was attributable to decreased oven sales of million related to sales to subway franchisees 
in  increased oven sales to other customers combined with increased sales of parts and consumables accounted for an increase of million in product revenues  but did not offset the reduced sales to subway following completion of the rollout 
subway sales accounted for of our revenue in  in and in the subway rollout was  in our opinion  unusual in several respects 
the subway system comprises one of the largest foodservice operations in the us additionally  a rollout of such magnitude would not typically be completed over such a short time 
subway will continue to be an important contributor to our revenues as we supply ovens for new stores and as existing stores evaluate their needs for additional ovens 
we expect continued growth in commercial oven sales as we expand our customer base 
however  we do not expect future transactions with large foodservice operators to impact the timing and magnitude of oven sales in the same way the subway transaction has done 
royalty and services revenue  which consists principally of revenue from licensing our technology to third parties  was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  royalty and services revenue increased  for  from million for we had only a partial year of such revenue in since these activities are associated primarily with the enersyst acquisition which was completed in may we expect further diminution in services revenue as the resources which generate this revenue are repurposed to support our commercial oven business and to benefit our residential speed cook oven initiative 
cost of product sales and gross profit cost of product sales for was million  a decrease of million compared to million for cost of product sales decreased  for  from million for the variability in cost of product sales in compared to and was due primarily to increases in our warranty provision of million recorded in  and  to a lesser extent  the number of ovens sold 
in increased costs of materials and component parts  primarily stainless steel  and increased costs of freight and handling began to increase our cost of manufacturing compared to in  we continued to experience increased costs of materials and component parts compared to and we experienced higher costs in our extended warranty program  which were partially offset by a reduction in cost of products sold in connection with settlement of a dispute over amounts due for prior product purchases 
much of our sales volume is presently based on contracts with somewhat fixed pricing which constrains our ability to pass on these increased manufacturing costs 
we instituted price increases late in for our non contract customers and we reached agreement with our major contract customers on price increases  fully in effect in mid  that have begun to help mitigate these increased costs 
excluding the million increase to our warranty provision recorded in  the combined effect of the foregoing factors resulted in a similar cost of product sales as a percentage of product sales for and and an increase in cost of product sales as a percentage of related product sales for as compared to gross profit on product sales for was million  an increase of million  compared to gross profit on product sales of million for gross profit on product sales decreased million for  from million for the variability in the gross profit on product sales was due primarily to the number of ovens sold and to a million increase in our warranty provision recorded in gross profit on product sales as a percentage of product sales revenue  excluding the effects of the million increase in our warranty provision in  remained constant for as compared to  and decreased in as compared to barring any future warranty charges in excess of reserves provided and barring any continued pricing pressures on materials and components  we expect improvement in gross margins on commercial oven sales to be largely sustained as the sales mix shifts to include relatively fewer sales from lower margin contracts 
research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of payroll and benefits  consulting services paid to third parties  supplies  facilities and other administrative costs for support of the engineers  scientists and other research and development personnel who design  develop  test and enhance our ovens and oven related services 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
research and development expenses increased  or  to million for as compared to million for research and development expenses increased or million for as compared to million for the increase in as compared to  as well as as compared to  was attributable to an expanded scope of research activities to support new product development  including most recently the development of our residential speed cook ovens 
additionally  in  the enersyst acquisition increased the headcount and resources committed to research activities 
the following table quantifies the net increase in research and development expenses over periods presented in thousands increase decrease in research and development expenses to to payroll and related expenses general and administrative expenses design  prototype and other related expenses total increase we believe that research and development expenses for will approximate levels  as we continue our development efforts for residential speed cook ovens and related products and for new commercial ovens planned for introduction in early to mid purchased research and development purchased research and development expenses for and were million and million  respectively  and related to the acquisition of technology assets from global 
this charge is an allocation of the purchase price  based on a valuation  to recognize the fair value of in process research and development for new products and modifications to existing products that have not reached technological feasibility or were not ready for commercial production 
the expense represents the fair value of the liability incurred for additional consideration payable now that certain contingencies are resolved 
there are no further consideration contingencies associated with the global acquisition

restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of  we closed our underperforming operation in the netherlands and re aligned the resources and cost structure 
we now direct the activities of all of our international distributors directly from our domestic operations center 
since we continue to have a presence in the markets previously managed by our netherlands operation  the results of that unit s operations are included in continuing operations 
the closing of the netherlands operations resulted in restructuring charges in the fourth quarter of of  including  of non cash charges  principally related to impairment of fixed assets 
in the first quarter of  the company negotiated to terminate the lease of the closed facility and recorded a reduction in the restructuring reserve of  the lease termination payment was made in april and concludes the restructuring plan initiated in the fourth quarter of interest income interest income includes amounts earned on invested cash balances 
interest income was million for and million for representing earnings on available cash  including proceeds from the february public offering of our common stock

this tax provision is an effective tax rate of and reflects utilization of approximately million in nols carried forward from prior years which reduced our taxable income in as of december   we have available approximately million in remaining nol carryforwards  of which million are subject to annual limitations resulting from the change in control provisions in section of the internal revenue code 
these nols begin to expire in as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  a valuation allowance has been recorded to reduce our net deferred income tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
based on our previous history of losses  we have recorded a valuation allowance as of december   equal to the full amount of our net deferred income tax assets including those related to our nols 
future profitable operations would permit recognition of these net deferred income tax assets  which would have the effect of reducing our income tax expense 
future operations could also demonstrate a return to profitability sufficient to warrant a reversal of the valuation allowance  which would positively impact our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements in connection with our product and technology development and marketing efforts have been significant 
in light of the planned launch in of our residential speed cook ovens  the capital requirements for these efforts likely will continue to be significant 
on february   we closed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at before discounts and commissions to underwriters and other offering expenses 
of the shares sold   were sold by the company and  were sold by certain selling stockholders 
we are using the net proceeds  approximately million  to finance the development and introduction of our residential speed cook ovens  to pursue possible acquisitions or strategic investments and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
our management anticipates that current cash on hand provides sufficient liquidity for us to execute our business plan and expand our business as needed in the near term 
additionally  we renewed our credit facility with bank of america which now expires on february  this facility provides stand by credit availability to augment the cash flow anticipated from operations 
however  should the launch of our residential speed cook oven products or a significant increase in demand for commercial products engender significant expansion of our operations  we may require additional capital in future periods

we intend to seek financing for any amounts that we are unable to pay from operating cash flows 
financing alternatives are routinely evaluated to determine their practicality and availability in order to provide us with additional funding at the least possible cost 
we believe that our existing cash  credit availability and anticipated future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital investment requirements for the next twelve months and a reasonable period of time thereafter 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
this interpretation clarifies the application of sfas no 
by defining a criterion that an individual tax position must meet for any part of the benefit of that position to be recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
the interpretation would require us to review all tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
and apply a more likely than not recognition threshold 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is initially and subsequently measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
subsequent recognition  de recognition  and measurement is based on management s best judgment given the facts  circumstances and information available at the reporting date 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of this statement will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  however  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
the definition of fair value retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value 
this statement emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data and the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances 
this statement clarifies that market participant assumptions include assumptions about risk and assumptions about the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and clarifies that a fair value measurement for a liability reflects its nonperformance risk 
this statement expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission the sec issued sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
the primary concepts set forth in sab no 
are as follows a registrants should quantify errors using both the rollover approach current year statement of operations effect and iron curtain approach year end balance sheet effect and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material  b if correcting an item in the current year materially affects the current year but the item was not material in any prior years  the prior year financial statements should be corrected  even though such revision previously was and continues to be immaterial to the prior year financial statements  however  in this circumstance  the correction can be made the next time the prior year financial statements are filed  c for purposes of evaluating materiality under the iron curtain approach  all uncorrected errors on the balance sheet are presumed to be reversed into the statement of operations in the current period even though some or all of the uncorrected difference may relate to periods prior to the latest statement of operations presented and  therefore  would only impact opening accumulated earnings deficit or if the amount of the uncorrected difference s is determined to be material to the current period statement of operations  then such amount would be deemed material and would have to be corrected for in the manner set forth above 
sab no 
provides for the following transition guidance in the initial period of adoption a restatement of prior years is not required if the registrant properly applied its previous approach  either rollover or iron curtain approach  so long as all relevant qualitative factors were considered  b the sec staff will not object if a registrant records a one time cumulative effect adjustment to correct errors existing in prior years that previously had been considered immaterial  quantitatively and qualitatively  based on the appropriate use of the registrant s previous approach  c if prior years are not restated  the cumulative effect adjustment is recorded in opening accumulated earnings deficit as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption eg january  
sab no 
is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november   with earlier adoption encouraged 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective of which is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
eligible items for the measurement option include all recognized financial assets and liabilities except investments in subsidiaries  interests in variable interest entities  employers and plans obligations for pension benefits  assets and liabilities recognized under leases  deposit liabilities  financial instruments that are a component of shareholder s equity 
also included are firm commitments that involve only financial instruments  nonfinancial insurance contracts and warranties and host financial instruments 
the statement permits all entities to choose at specified election dates  after which the entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings  at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option may be applied instrument by instrument  however  the election is irrevocable and is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we conduct business in several foreign countries 
as a result  we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
additionally  we may continue to expand our operations globally  which may increase our exposure to foreign exchange fluctuations
