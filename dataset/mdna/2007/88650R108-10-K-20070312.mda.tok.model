our management strategy in an effort to increase our profitability  we implemented a plan to grow and diversify our operations to become a regional community bank 
in our primary banking market area we have endeavored to position ourselves as a local alternative to national and super regional competitors 
in addition  we have availed ourselves of additional loan opportunities outside our primary banking market area and have selectively entered into relationships with other financial institutions throughout the united states to purchase whole loans or participation interests in loans  particularly commercial real estate  land and land development and construction loans 
additionally  we have opened or acquired loan production offices in high growth cities of the united states in an effort to strategically supplement our loan origination activities 
highlights of our long term management strategy are as follows continuing our controlled growth and expanding our franchise 
we have increased our total assets in each of the past five years 
during this previous five year period  total assets have increased by billion to billion 
in addition  we believe that our conversion from mutual to stock form in october facilitated our ability to expand our franchise 
we have also executed a strategic acquisition plan designed to strengthen market share in our primary banking market area as well as to build our lending presence in growing metropolitan areas outside of our primary banking market area 
building a quality loan portfolio to increase yields and or reduce interest rate risk 
we have focused on increasing our holdings of quality loans with relatively higher yields  adjustable interest rates and or shorter terms to maturity 
at december   our second mortgage residential  multi family residential  commercial real estate  land and land development  construction  business  agricultural  warehouse mortgage lines of credit and consumer loans amounted to billion in the aggregate or of our total loan portfolio 
this compares to billion  or  of total loans at december  we have sought to maintain a high level of asset quality and moderate credit risk by utilizing loan underwriting standards which we believe are conservative 
although we are an acquirer of loans and participation interests in loans from outside our primary lending market area  we generally apply our own underwriting standards to all such loans 
our nonperforming loans as a percentage of net loans at december  were compared to at december  while our nonperforming loan ratio has generally trended upward in the past five years due in part to our strategy of increasing yields  we remain focused on minimizing credit risk through our loan origination  monitoring and recovery processes 
emphasizing growth of our core deposits and minimizing our cost of funds 
our core deposits  consisting of checking  money market and savings accounts  have increased from million at december  to million at december  we continue our emphasis on increasing the number of core checking account relationships  which during the five year period ended december   have grown by from  to  the establishment of additional core relationships  including consumer and business banking relationships  provides new opportunities to sell other profitable products and services and increase market share 
increasing our fee income and expanding our products and services 
noninterest income increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase primarily reflects increased fee income due largely to an increase in the number of core deposit accounts 
we have been pro active in our efforts to increase noninterest income  largely by increasing the number of customers that we serve in our primary banking market area as well as increasing the number of our financial products that we offer our customers 
we expect our employees to cross sell our financial products and services to customers and we provide them with economic incentives to do so 
our efforts have also included redesigning a number of our banking offices to be retail sales centers  which have a floor plan we believe is more conducive to cross selling of products 
we continually search for new products and services that serve the needs of our customers 
in the past five years  we have introduced on line banking  farm and ranch management services  cash management services  business checking and an expanded business loan program 
improving brand awareness and perception 
our success in continuing to build a profitable market share in the areas we serve is partially driven by our ability to positively extend the reach of our corporate identity through increased public awareness and market perception 
in our competitive environment  where consumers and businesses are offered a multitude of choices for banking services  a strong corporate brand enhances our ability to be among the candidates when a final selection is made 
this is achieved through a comprehensive  consistent and sustainable marketing program  an effective delivery of competitive products and services and a well trained and knowledgeable workforce 
while building brand awareness and perception is important throughout the entire market region  special emphasis has and will be placed in growing metropolitan and economically vibrant regional growth center market areas
