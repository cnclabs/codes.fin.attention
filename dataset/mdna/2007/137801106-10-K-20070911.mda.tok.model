overview introduction we are a growing independent oil and natural gas company that is actively pursuing waterflooding and enhanced oil recovery techniques to increase production and reserves at our existing properties and properties acquired in the future 
our primary focus is crude oil and our target acquisitions are onshore us properties 
our focus on domestic  mature oil fields eliminates exploration risks and uncertainties of international sources 
we use waterflooding and enhanced oil recovery methods  such as alkaline surfactant polymer technology 
during our first two years of operations through june   our primary focus was to achieve growth through acquiring existing  mature oil and natural gas fields 
in march  we acquired permian basin oil and natural gas properties located in new mexico 
we believe the portfolio of oil and natural gas properties that we have acquired thus far provides ample opportunities to apply our operational strategy 
as of june   we had proved reserves of  mboe  of which  mboe were proved producing   mboe were proved non producing  and  mboe were proved undeveloped 
during the fiscal year ended june   our primary emphasis was to achieve growth by developing our existing oil and natural gas properties through development activities such as waterflooding and eor technology 
we will continue to evaluate potential acquisition targets that are consistent with our operational strategy 
these development activities are more clearly defined later in the next section titled capital development update 
as discussed in greater detail below under liquidity and capital resources  during september  we issued preferred and common stock that had net proceeds of million 
these proceeds were used to repay long term debt of million  and the remainder was used to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes  including the funding of our fiscal capital budget  as discussed below 
our outstanding subordinated debt totaling million  with an interest rate of  has been permanently retired 
the credit agreement is our only source of long term debt 
capital development update for the year ended june  fiscal year  we incurred million of capital expenditures 
of the million  million was incurred million spent to implement developmental projects at our existing fields to increase reserves  convert existing proved undeveloped reserves to proved producing reserves  and increase production 
the remaining million pertained to our acquisition of new mexico properties  as discussed below 
the million was financed by the september financing and credit agreement  as discussed below under liquidity and capital resources 
for the year ending june  fiscal year  we have a capital development budget of million  which is further discussed under planned capital expenditures 
the status of our capital development activity during fiscal year and planned activity during fiscal year is summarized as follows panhandle properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the panhandle properties are  mboe  of which  mboe are proved producing   mboe are proved undeveloped and none of which is proved non producing 
current production is approximately boepd 
we are progressing with the execution of our waterflood development plan at the cockrell ranch unit of the panhandle field 
we were granted our phase i waterflood injection permits from the texas railroad commission in february we have had two drilling rigs running in the field since april and have drilled and completed waterflood replacement wells in our phase i and phase ii development patterns 
replacement wells remain to be drilled to complete phase iii 
we commenced water injection into the cockrell ranch unit waterflood at the panhandle field on july  at the present time  we have a total of injection wells water moving into the brown dolomite formation at roughly  barrels per day 
as we continue bringing additional injection wells on  we anticipate achieving the full well injection pattern by mid october with a maximum injection rate of  barrels per day 
preliminary response from the waterflood is still anticipated in december full waterflood development over the remaining  net acres of the panhandle properties is anticipated once the initial response data is available 
desdemona properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the desdemona properties are  mboe  of which mboe are proved producing   mboe are proved non producing and  mboe are proved undeveloped 
current production is approximately boepd 
desdemona properties waterflood 
we have drilled and completed required replacement wells to initiate the development of the duke sand waterflood at desdemona 
procurement and infrastructure development of the waterflood facilities is complete 
we have received preliminary approval of our waterflood permit from the texas railroad commission and expect to initiate water injection within the next days 
we anticipate an initial waterflood response in the first calendar quarter of desdemona properties barnett shale 
we have successfully drilled and completed wells in the barnett shale formation in this field  located some miles west of established barnett shale production in the ft 
worth basin 
we have drilled fifteen vertical wells to delineate the lateral extent of the barnett shale formation within the roughly  acres of our desdemona field 
currently  the barnett shale vertical wells are averaging mcfpd of total gas production 
the results of the vertical well test program have provided encouraging results that have allowed us to initiate our horizontal well development program in the field 
based on our vertical test results and analogs  it is internally estimated cano has total horizontal locations on roughly acre spacing  of which future horizontal locations were considered for proved undeveloped reserves 
we booked proved reserves of mmboe for the barnett shale play at june  of this amount  mmboe was proved undeveloped 
we also have marble falls formation re completion potential in all of our vertical and horizontal barnett shale wells 
based on the three existing marble falls re completions producing in the field  we booked mmboe of proved reserves  of which mmboe was proved undeveloped in the marble falls formation 
we have drilled and completed horizontal wells out of the announced fy budget horizontal wells in the field 
the four new wells are currently flowing back load and are under evaluation 
in response to currently low natural gas prices  we have elected to defer the drilling program in the barnett shale 
of the remaining capital amount of roughly million committed to this program  roughly million will be re directed to the new mexico properties as discussed below and the balance of million will committed to the barnett shale program once natural gas prices improve 
nowata properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the nowata properties are  mboe  all of which are proved producing 
as a result of prior waterflood operations on the nowata properties  current net production is approximately boepd 
we completed the budgeted workovers to return wells to production in the nowata field to optimize the existing waterflood pattern 
our tertiary recovery pilot project at the nowata field is underway 
the asp pilot plant  associated equipment and supplies were installed and tested during july and august asp pilot start up operations will begin in mid september response is anticipated in the first calendar quarter of davenport properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the davenport properties are  mboe  of which mboe are proved producing  mboe are proved non producing and none of which are proved undeveloped 
as a result of ongoing waterflood operations on the davenport properties  current production is approximately boepd 
we completed workovers to return twelve wells to production and are awaiting final regulatory approval to activate eleven injection wells to optimize the existing waterflood pattern at this field 
initial results of the wells returned to production have been encouraging and production increases have exceeded expectations 
contingent upon successful laboratory studies  we anticipate initiating an asp pilot project during our fiscal year ending june  corsicana properties 
the corsicana properties were the subject of a proved surfactant polymer chemical injection pilot in the s and contain proved reserves as of june  of mboe  of which mboe are proved non producing and mboe are proved undeveloped 
we have drilled and completed pattern replacement wells and plan to reinstate a prior waterflood in this field 
during june  we received the required permits to inject water 
we are planning to reinstate the prior waterflood in september as we previously mentioned  we have been pleased with the remaining oil saturations in this field and coupled with the prior successful polymer pilot in this field in the s we believe this field is a prime asp candidate 
once the waterflood response and laboratory results are analyzed  we anticipate evaluating an asp pilot in the field in calendar year pantwist properties 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the pantwist properties are  mboe  of which  mboe are proved producing   mboe are proved undeveloped and none of which are proved non producing 
current production is approximately boepd 
we anticipate implementation of waterflood injection operations during and calendar years 
new mexico properties new acquisition 
in addition to the capital spending activities previously discussed  we completed an acquisition on march   with an effective date of february   to acquire certain oil and gas properties in the permian basin for approximately million  after purchase price adjustments 
proved reserves as of june  attributable to the new mexico properties are  mboe  of which mboe are proved producing   mboe are proved undeveloped and mboe are proved non producing 
current production is approximately boepd 
these properties include roughly  acres and three fields in chavez and roosevelt counties  new mexico 
the prime asset is the roughly  acre cato field  which produces from the historically prolific san andres formation  which has been successfully waterflooded in the permian basin for over years 
we believe that the cato field is the largest san andres field in the permian basin that has never been flooded 
there were two successful waterflood pilots conducted in the field in the s by shell and amoco 
this field was unitized by kelt oil in  secondary recovery permits are in place and there now exists a water supply pipeline to an adjacent field miles away 
moreover  this field is a very viable co tertiary flood candidate with a co pipeline located four miles from the site 
we initiated well workovers and a return to production program in may we have worked over idle wells and have returned wells to production to date 
we plan to return between wells to production during the course of the year 
we have deployed re frac stimulations on four wells in the field 
production responses of between boepd per well have been achieved 
it is our goal to re frac up to of the return to production wells during the course of the year 
additionally  one drilling rig has been contracted to drill new acre spaced wells in areas of the field that have not been developed 
the first well is expected to spud by october another drilling rig has been contracted to drill new acre infill wells in an area of the field that had a prior waterflood pilot 
the first well is expected to spud by november initiation of phase i of the waterflood at cato is scheduled for second calendar quarter of rich valley field 
on june   pursuant to the terms of an agreement for purchase and sale  we sold our interests in the rich valley properties located in oklahoma and kansas to anadarko minerals  inc for net proceeds of million cash 
the agreement had an effective date of april  all of the funds received were used to reduce the outstanding balance under the credit agreement discussed below 
as of april   the assets of the rich valley properties totaled million  of which million represented the oil and gas properties  net 
we recognized a million pre tax gain on the sale of the rich valley properties 
industry conditions we believe significant acquisition opportunities will continue to exist primarily because the major energy companies and large independents continue to focus their attention and resources toward the discovery and development of large fields 
during the past several years  the major companies have been divesting themselves of their mature oilfields  a trend management expects will continue 
also  the recent economics of the oil and natural gas market have improved as prices have risen substantially 
these conditions provide ample opportunities for smaller independent companies to acquire and exploit mature us fields 
we expect that there will be increased competition for such properties in the future 
our strategy acquire strategic assets 
we seek to acquire low cost assets with a high ratio of non proven or proved undeveloped reserves suitable for waterflood and eor techniques  primarily in the onshore united states 
we believe we have acquired an attractive portfolio of assets to implement our business plan 
we will continue to selectively target potential acquisition candidates in a disciplined manner  which involves being financially prudent and acquiring assets that meet our engineering and operational standards 
we focus on us operations 
accordingly  we are not subject to geopolitical uncertainties  dependence on foreign sources and other issues related to overseas operations 
no exploration risk 
our portfolio is comprised of mature fields with proven reserves  existing infrastructure and abundant technical information 
accordingly  our production growth is not dependent on exploration drilling and the high degree of speculation in making new discoveries 
exploit and develop existing properties 
we intend to add proved reserves to  and increase production from  our existing properties through the application of advanced technologies  including water  gas or chemical flooding and other eor techniques 
we believe that our management team has a proven track record of exploiting underdeveloped properties to increase reserves and cash flow 
maintain a low cost structure 
we intend to maintain a low cost structure through maintaining efficient operations and operating control 
we intend to be the working interest operator in a high proportion of our properties 
this allows us to exercise more control over expenses  capital allocation  and the timing of development and exploitation activities in our fields 
it also enables us to implement controls over our costs to ensure prudent expenditures 
further  we employ engineering and geological consultants to aid in evaluating the economic merits of drilling plans and potential acquisitions on a case by case basis rather than staffing these positions  enabling us to maintain low fixed costs 
waterflood operations and eor techniques such as surfactant polymer chemical injection involve significant capital investment and an extended period of time  generally a year or longer  from the initial phase of a program until increased production occurs 
generally  surfactant polymer injection is regarded as more risky compared to waterflood operations 
our ability to successfully convert proved undeveloped reserves to proved producing reserves will be contingent upon our ability to obtain future financing and or raise additional capital  and further  is greatly contingent upon inherent uncertainties associated with the production of oil and natural gas as well as price volatility 
see risk factors 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital and liquidity have been issuance of equity securities  borrowings under credit facilities with lenders  and cash flows from operating activities 
september financing on september   we sold in a private placement  shares of series d convertible preferred stock at a price of  per share and  shares of common stock at a price of per share  the three day average closing price of the stock prior to the execution of the definitive agreements  plus a warrant component 
the preferred stock has a dividend and features a paid in kind pik provision that allows  at the investor s option  the investor to receive additional shares of common stock upon conversion for the dividend in lieu of a cash dividend payment 
holders of approximately of the preferred stock chose the pik dividend option 
the preferred stock is convertible to common stock at a price of per share and the common stock was subject to warrant coverage at an exercise price of per share 
if any series d convertible preferred stock remains outstanding on september   we are required to redeem the series d convertible preferred stock for a redemption amount in cash equal to the stated value of the preferred stock  plus accrued dividends and pik dividends 
gross proceeds from the transactions were million  of which million was attributable to the preferred stock  and million was attributable to the common stock and warrants 
net proceeds were million after deducting for issuance costs of million 
the warrant component totals  common shares and is exercisable at per share 
the exercise period commenced on march  and expires on march  for the year ended june   the preferred dividend was  of which  pertained to holders of the pik dividend option 
cash proceeds from the september financing were used to repay long term debt of million see note to the consolidated financial statements  for general corporate purposes and to fund our capital expenditures as previously discussed 
the long term debt consisted of amounts due under the credit agreement and subordinated credit agreement of million and million  respectively 
due to repaying the million outstanding balance on the subordinated credit agreement  this debt facility was permanently retired 
credit agreement on november   we entered into a million credit agreement credit agreement with the lenders led by union bank of california  na  as administrative agent and as issuing lender 
during the quarter ended march   natixis was named as a lender via an amendment to the credit agreement 
the maturity date is november  at june   we had million outstanding under our credit agreement 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on september   our lenders approved an increase in the borrowing base to million 
at september   we had million outstanding under our credit agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  the borrowing base is based on our proved reserves and is redetermined every six months with one additional redetermination possible during the six month periods between scheduled redeterminations 
subject to certain restrictions  the credit agreement permits the issuance of convertible notes and equity with an optional redetermination of the borrowing base upon such issuance 
if we are not in default under the credit agreement  we may make interest payments on any convertible notes and dividend payments on any preferred equity securities 
the credit agreement provides that we must comply with certain covenants for leverage and interest coverage ratios 
these ratios are discussed in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we were in compliance with these ratios as of june  at our option  interest is based either i on the prime rate plus the applicable margin ranging up to based on the utilization level or ii on the libor rate applicable to the interest period plus the applicable margin ranging from to based on the utilization level 
at june  and  the interest rate was and  respectively 
at september   the interest rate was 
for loans that are three months or less in maturity  interest is due on the maturity date of such loan 
for loans that are in excess of three months  interest is due every three months 
the outstanding principal is due on or before november  unless pursuant to the terms of the credit agreement  specific events of default occur as a result of which all outstanding principal and all accrued interest may be accelerated 
such specific events of default  include  but are not limited to payment defaults by us  breaches of representations and warranties and covenants by us  our insolvency  a change of control of our business as described in the credit agreement and a material adverse change as described in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement imposes certain restrictions on us and our subsidiaries including  but not limited to  the following i subject to specific exceptions  incurring additional liens  ii subject to specific exceptions  incurring additional debt  iii subject to specific exceptions  merging or consolidating or selling  transferring  assigning  farming out  conveying or otherwise disposing of any property  iv subject to specific exceptions  making certain payments  including cash dividends to our stockholders  v subject to specific exceptions  making any loans  advances or capital contributions to  or making any investment in  or purchasing or committing to purchase any stock or other securities or evidences of indebtedness or interests in any person or any oil and natural gas properties or activities related to oil and natural gas properties unless with regard to new oil and natural gas properties  such properties are mortgaged to union bank of california  na  as administrative agent  or with regard to new subsidiaries  such subsidiaries execute a guaranty  pledge agreement  security agreement and mortgage in favor of union bank of california  na  as administrative agent  and vi subject to specific exceptions  entering into affiliate transactions on terms that are not at least as favorable to us as comparable arm s length transactions 
in addition  we are required to enter into financial contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity price risk associated with expected oil and natural production 
the credit agreement requires financial hedge contracts to cover no less than and no more than of the production volumes attributable to our proved reserves 
our financial hedge contracts are further discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
as security for our obligations under the credit agreement i each of our subsidiaries has guaranteed all of our obligations  ii we  together with each of our subsidiaries  have executed mortgages in favor of union bank of california  na  as collateral trustee  covering oil and natural gas properties located in texas  oklahoma and new mexico  iii we  together with each of our subsidiaries  have granted a security interest in favor of union bank of california  na  as collateral trustee  in substantially all of our assets  and iv we have pledged our ownership interests in all of our subsidiaries to union bank of california  na  as collateral trustee 
cash flows from operating activities and other capital resources at june   our cash balance was million 
we had cash provided by operating activities of million during fiscal year  which was an improvement of million as compared to the million used in operations for fiscal year 
the million improvement is largely due to improved earnings as discussed under results of operations years ended june   and and reduced expenditures for commodity derivatives 
at june   we had unused borrowing capacity of million 
the average interest rate of our debt was at june  these results included net proceeds of million that we received for the sale of the rich valley properties  as previously discussed 
we believe the combination of cash on hand  cash flow generated from operations  strong commodity prices  available debt of million under our credit agreement  and access to the capital markets for any future public or private issuances of debt or equity issuances should be sufficient to finance our working capital needs and million capital expenditure program for fiscal year as further discussed below  in the section titled planned capital expenditures 
however  no assurance may be given that we will be successful in improving our operating results  the eventual success of our field developmental activities during the next twelve months or that we can successfully access capital markets for debt or equity issuances 
planned capital expenditures for fiscal year we have a capital development budget of million 
we plan to spend approximately to million during the six months ended december  and the remaining amount during the six months ended june  as discussed under capital development update  the expenditures will primarily focus on completion of the phase i waterflood development at the panhandle properties  initiate well workovers and a return to production of the new mexico properties  continued drilling in the barnett shale and completion of the asp injection at the nowata properties 
results of operations years ended june   and overall for the fiscal year  we had a loss applicable to common stock of million  which is million higher as compared to the million loss applicable to common stock for year ended june  fiscal year 
for the fiscal year  we had a loss applicable to common stock of million  which is million lower as compared to the million loss applicable to common stock incurred for the year ended june  fiscal year 
the following table summarizes the differences between the years ended june   and increase decrease fiscal year ended june  amounts in millions v 
v 
results of continuing oil and gas producing operations  excluding unrealized loss on commodity derivatives income from discontinued operations less the following items general and administrative interest expense  net deferred income tax benefit preferred stock dividend preferred stock discount unrealized loss on commodity derivatives net loss applicable to common stock results of oil and natural gas producing operations consist of operating revenues plus realized gain on commodity derivatives less lease operating expenses  production taxes  accretion of asset retirement obligations  and depletion and depreciation 
the income from the discontinued operations pertains to the sale of our rich valley properties  as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal year results of continuing oil and gas producing operations is million higher than fiscal year primarily due to including a full twelve months of operating results from the panhandle and pantwist properties which contributed million 
the fiscal year operating results included seven months of panhandle properties and two months of pantwist properties 
the remaining million increase is attributed to improved operating results from our davenport  desdemona and nowata properties primarily due to increased sales 
fiscal year is million higher than fiscal year primarily due to including seven months of operating results from the acquisition of the panhandle properties which contributed million  including two months of operating results from the pantwist properties which contributed million  including two months of operating results from the nowata properties which contributed million  and improved operating results from our davenport  desdemona  and nowata properties  primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices received and increased sales 
the other factors mentioned in the above table will be addressed in the following discussion 
operating revenues the table below summarizes our operating revenues for the years ended june   and increase decrease year ended june  v 
v 
operating revenues     sales oil mbbls gas mmcf  mboe average price bbl mcf boe fiscal year v 
fiscal year the fiscal year operating revenues of million represent an improvement of million as compared to the fiscal year operating revenues of million 
the million improvement is primarily due to including a full twelve months of panhandle and pantwist properties operating revenues  accounted for million mboe of the improvement 
the fiscal year included seven months of panhandle properties revenue and two months of pantwist properties revenue 
increased revenues from the desdemona properties million of revenue and mboe of sales primarily due to increased natural gas sales from our development of the barnett shale formation  as previously discussed under capital development update 
increased production from the davenport and nowata properties million and mboe of sales 
production from the recent acquisition  effective april   of our new mexico properties million and mboe of sales 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year the fiscal year operating revenues of million represent an improvement of million as compared to the fiscal year of million 
the million improvement is primarily attributable to including seven months of operating revenue from the panhandle properties million of revenue and mboe of sales  including two months of operating revenue from the pantwist properties million of revenue and mboe of sales  including an additional two months of operating revenue from the nowata field million of revenue and mboe of sales  the higher prices received for crude oil and natural gas sales  and increased sales of mboe from the other fields 
the average price we received for crude oil sales is generally at or above posted prices in the field 
the average price we receive for natural gas sales is approximately the market indexed price less marketing and other purchaser expenses 
the average prices received for crude oil and natural gas sales are positively impacted by settlement payments received under our derivative agreements as discussed below under loss on hedging contracts settlement payments 
during march  there were grass fires in the texas panhandle area 
these fires temporarily shut in production on the panhandle properties until flow lines were restored 
we estimate the temporary shut in resulted in approximately million reduction in revenues for march and april by mid april  the panhandle properties were producing at of normal operations 
we expect future increases to sales through capital expenditures as previously discussed under capital development update 
operating expenses fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our total operating expenses were million  or million higher than the fiscal year of million 
the million increase is primarily attributed to including a full twelve months of panhandle and pantwist properties operating expenses  accounted for million of the increase 
the fiscal year included seven months of panhandle properties revenue and two months of pantwist properties revenue 
higher general and administrative expenses of million 
higher operating expenses due to increased sales  as discussed under operating revenues 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our total operating expenses were million  or million higher than the fiscal year of million 
the million increase is primarily attributed to including seven months of the panhandle properties operating expenses totaling million  including two months of the pantwist properties operating expenses totaling million  including two additional months of the nowata field operating expenses totaling million  higher general administrative expenses of million  and higher other operating expenses due to increased sales  as discussed under operating revenues 
lease operating expenses our lease operating expenses loe consists of the costs of producing crude oil and natural gas such as labor  supplies  repairs  maintenance  and utilities 
our loe per boe showed a positive downward trend during the past three years as for the  and fiscal years  the loe per boe was  and  respectively  for our continuing operations 
we generally incur a high amount of loe because our fields are more mature and typically produce less oil and more water  and they are generally at the end of the primary or secondary production cycle 
since our acquisitions are mature fields  our initial focus is to evaluate the existing operations and make the necessary operational improvements to improve operating efficiency 
based on management s past experience  it generally requires up to twelve months to fully analyze the acquired field and spend the necessary funds to improve the field operations to meet our operational standards 
we expect these expenditures should lead to increased operational efficiency and reduced operating expenses in future periods 
general and administrative expenses our general and administrative g a expenses consist of support services for our operating activities and investor relations costs 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our g a expenses totaled million  which is million higher than the fiscal year of million 
the primary contributors to the million increase were increased labor and staffing costs of million  higher legal fees of million to comply with regulatory requirements and for litigation  increased fees of million for accounting services for sec reporting and to achieve full compliance with the section of the sarbanes oxley act  expenses of million to maintain the wo energy offices  and other items totaling million due to higher office rent expenses  increased board of director compensation and increased insurance costs 
for the fiscal year and fiscal year  our payroll and payroll related costs comprise million and million  respectively  of our total g a expenses 
we expect these costs to continue to increase because the recent growth in the petroleum industry has increased competition for labor resources 
fiscal year v 
fiscal year for the fiscal year  our g a expenses totaled million  which is million higher than the fiscal year of million 
the primary contributors to the million increase were increased labor and staffing costs of million  higher legal fees of million to comply with regulatory requirements and for litigation  expenses associated with the sabine joint venture of million  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements for the year ended june   expenses of million to maintain the wo energy offices  and other items totaling million are attributed to higher travel costs  board of director compensation  higher accounting fees and increased insurance costs 
offsetting these increases was lower deferred compensation expense of million 
realized gain unrealized loss on hedging contracts as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year and fiscal year  we paid million and million  respectively  to enter into financial contracts to set price floors for crude oil and natural gas through june we recorded an unrealized loss on commodity derivatives of million and million  respectively  to reflect the fair value of the derivative instruments as of june  and by their nature  these derivative instruments can be highly volatile to our earnings 
a five percent change in these prices for our derivative instruments can impact earnings by approximately  we did not have hedging contracts during the fiscal year 
also  during the and fiscal years  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  there were settlements under our commodity derivatives due to us amounting to  and  respectively  which are recorded as realized gain on commodity derivative 
the settlements were cumulative monthly payments to us since the nymex natural gas price was lower than the floor natural gas prices ranging between and and the wti nymex oil price was lower than the floor oil prices ranging from to the cash flows relating to the derivative instruments are reflected in operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  the credit agreement requires that we hedge no less than and no more than of the production volumes attributable to our proved producing reserves 
we are required to maintain three year hedges  and to update our hedges semi annually 
we intend to enter into financial contracts to set price floors for our crude oil and natural gas production 
interest expense for fiscal year and fiscal year  we incurred interest expense of million and million  respectively  as a direct result of the credit agreements we entered into  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
we did not have credit agreements during the fiscal year 
as discussed under liquidity and capital resources and note of our consolidated financial statements  on september   we completed a private placement of preferred stock  common stock and warrants totaling gross proceeds of million 
the preferred dividend rate is 
these proceeds have been used to repay long term debt of million  and the remainder was used to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes  including the funding of a portion of our fiscal capital budget 
our outstanding subordinated debt totaling million  with an interest rate of  has been permanently retired 
the credit agreement is our only source of long term debt 
deferred income tax benefit as the result of the recognition of the deferred tax liabilities assumed in the acquisitions of wo energy and square one  we have recorded a net deferred tax liability 
this allows us to recognize deferred tax benefits from generation of net operating losses because a valuation allowance against such items is not required 
we review our deferred tax assets at least quarterly and record a valuation allowance against those assets when we conclude that it is more likely than not that those assets will expire without being utilized 
for the  and fiscal year  we recorded a deferred income tax benefit of million  million and  respectively 
for  the million benefit amounts to an effective tax rate of approximately  due to recording the effect of a change in enacted rates in the state of texas in may  amounting to  see note of our consolidated financial statements for more information 
income from discontinued operations on june   pursuant to the terms of an agreement for purchase and sale  we sold our interests in the rich valley properties located in oklahoma and kansas to anadarko minerals  inc for net proceeds of million cash 
the sale of the rich valley properties resulted in a pre tax gain of million 
for fiscal year  we recognized income from the discontinued operations of million 
this is discussed in greater detail at note of the consolidated financial statements 
preferred stock dividend the preferred stock dividend during the fiscal year of million resulted from the preferred stock financing  which was completed on september   as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we did not have preferred stock dividends during the fiscal year or fiscal year 
preferred stock discount the reduced preferred stock discount amounting to million occurred during the fiscal year and was attributable to certain issuances of preferred stock during that period 
since we did not issue preferred stock during the fiscal year and did not issue preferred stock at a discount during the fiscal year  there is no preferred stock discount for the or fiscal years 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations in thousands at june  for the periods shown amounts in s total less than one year one to three years three to five years more than five years long term debt   operating lease obligations see note  total contractual obligations   the credit facility matures on november  at september   there was million outstanding under the credit facility 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
selected quarterly financial data unaudited we derived the selected historical financial data in the table below from our unaudited interim consolidated financial statements 
the sum of net income per share by quarter may not equal the net income per share for the year due to variations in the weighted average shares outstanding used in computing such amounts

these are the accounting policies that we have determined involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we prepared our consolidated financial statements in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
gaap requires management to make judgments and estimates  including choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
oil and natural gas properties and equipment we follow the successful efforts method of accounting  capitalizing costs of successful exploratory wells and expensing costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells 
all developmental costs are capitalized 
we are predominately engaged in the acquisition and development of proved reserves as opposed to exploration activities 
the property costs reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were resulted from acquisitions and development activity 
we have capitalized overhead costs that directly relate to our drilling and development and we recorded capitalized interest costs 
depreciation and depletion of producing properties is computed on the units of production method based on estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves 
repairs and maintenance are expensed  while renewals and betterments are generally capitalized 
our units of production amortization rates are revised on a quarterly basis 
our development costs and lease and wellhead equipment are depleted based on proved developed reserves 
our leasehold costs are depleted based on total proved reserves 
investments in major development projects are not depleted until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
at least quarterly  or more frequently if conditions indicate that long term assets may be impaired  the carrying value of property is compared to management s future estimated pre tax cash flow from the properties 
if undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value  then the asset value is written down to fair value 
impairment of individually significant unproved properties is assessed on a property by property basis  and impairment of other unproved properties is assessed and amortized on an aggregate basis 
we had no significant unproved properties at june  or no impairment was necessary at june   or estimates of proved reserves the term proved reserves is defined by the securities and exchange commission in rule a of regulation s x adopted under the securities act of  as amended 
in general  proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil  gas and liquids that geological or engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions  ie  prices and costs as of the date the estimate is made 
prices include consideration of changes in existing prices provided only by contractual arrangements  but not on escalations based on future conditions 
our estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if proved reserves decline  then the rate at which we record depletion expense increases  reducing net income 
a decline in estimates of proved reserves may result from lower prices  evaluation of additional operating history  mechanical problems on our wells and catastrophic events such as explosions  hurricanes and floods 
lower prices also may make it uneconomical to drill wells or produce from fields with high operating costs 
in addition  a decline in proved reserves may impact our assessment of our oil and natural gas properties for impairment 
our proved reserve estimates are a function of many assumptions  all of which could deviate materially from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may vary materially from the ultimate quantities of oil and natural gas actually produced 
asset retirement obligation our financial statements reflect the fair value for any asset retirement obligation that can be reasonably estimated upon acquiring or drilling a well  and the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value at the asset s inception  with an offsetting increase to producing properties on the consolidated balance sheets 
periodic accretion of the discount of the estimated liability is recorded as an expense in the consolidated statements of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when crude oil and natural gas quantities are delivered to or collected by the respective purchaser 
title to the produced quantities transfers to the purchaser at the time the purchaser collects or receives the quantities 
prices for such production are defined in sales contracts and are readily determinable based on certain publicly available indices 
the purchasers of such production have historically made payment for crude oil and natural gas purchases within thirty five days of the end of each production month 
we periodically review the difference between the dates of production and the dates we collect payment for such production to ensure that receivables from those purchasers are collectible 
the point of sale for our oil and natural gas production is at our applicable field gathering systems  therefore  we do not incur transportation costs related to our sales of oil and natural gas production 
as of june  and  we sold our crude oil and natural gas production to several independent purchasers 
during the year ended june   we had sales of or more of our total revenues to primarily four customers which represented   and of total operating revenue  respectively 
during the year ended june   we had sales of or more of our total revenues to five customers representing    and of total operating revenue  respectively 
during the year ended june   we had sales to primarily three customers which represented  and of total operating revenue  respectively 
stock compensation expense effective july   we accounted for share based payments for services provided by employee to employer in accordance with sfas no 
r  which generally requires companies to value the fair value of employee stock options and other equity based compensation at the grant date and record the expense over the vesting period 
we adopted sfas no 
r beginning july  since we had expensed stock options in accordance with sfas no 
 the adoption of sfas no 
r did not materially impact our operating results  financial position  or our cash flows 
commodity derivatives we are required to hedge a portion of our production at specified prices for oil and natural gas under the credit agreement  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the objective is to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk associated with expected oil and natural gas production 
by achieving this objective we intend to protect the outstanding debt amounts and maximize the funds available under our existing credit agreement  which helps us to support our annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans 
we have entered into commodity derivatives that set price floors for our crude oil and natural gas production that are recorded as derivative assets on our consolidated balance sheets and are measured at fair value 
at june   we had no commodity derivatives that set a price ceiling 
we do not hold or issue commodity derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparty to our commodity derivatives 
we anticipate  however  that our counterparty  union bank of california  will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under the commodity derivatives contracts 
we do not obtain collateral or other security to support our commodity derivatives contracts subject to credit risk but we monitor the credit standing of the counterparty 
we have elected not to designate the commodity derivatives to which we are a party as hedges  and accordingly  we record such contracts at fair value and recognize changes in such fair value in current earnings as they occur 
changes in the fair values of our derivative instruments are recorded immediately in earnings as unrealized gain or loss on commodity derivatives on our consolidated statements of operations 
cash flows resulting from the settlement of our derivative instruments are recorded as realized gains on commodity derivatives on the consolidated statements of operations 
new accounting pronouncements sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 was issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb in september sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement 
no new requirements are included in sfas no 
 but application of sfas no 
will change current practice 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect adoption of sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
on july   the fasb released fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin requires companies to evaluate and disclose material uncertain tax positions it has taken with various taxing jurisdictions 
we have reviewed fin and determined the adoption of fin will not materially affect our operating results  financial position  or future cash flows 
we adopted fin on july  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity risk our revenues are derived from the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production 
the prices for oil and natural gas are extremely volatile and sometimes experience large fluctuations as a result of relatively small changes in supplies  weather conditions  economic conditions and government actions 
pursuant to our credit agreement  we are required to enter into financial contracts to hedge approximately to of our production at specified floors for oil and natural gas between and per barrel and between and per mcf 
therefore  for the hedged production  we will receive at least the floor prices 
during the year ended june   approximately of our production was hedged 
the remaining was not subject to the floors and is subject to the volatility and price fluctuations of oil and natural gas 
assuming that the prices that we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production are above the above described floors  based on our actual fiscal year sales volumes for the year ended june   a decline in the prices we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production would have had an approximate million impact on our revenues 
interest rate risk at june   we had borrowings of million outstanding under our credit agreement 
at june   if there had been an increase in the interest rate of  our interest expense would have increased by  annually 
commodity derivatives we are required to hedge a portion of our production at specified prices for oil and natural gas under the credit agreement  as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the objective is to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk associated with expected oil and natural gas production 
by achieving this objective we intend to protect the outstanding debt amounts and maximize the funds available under our existing credit agreement  which helps us to support our annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans 
we have entered into commodity derivatives that set price floors for our crude oil and natural gas production 
during our years ended june  and  we paid million and million to enter into commodity derivatives to set price floors 
these financial contracts are summarized in the table below 
time period floor oil price barrels per day floor gas price gas mcf per day barrels of equivalent oil per day during the years ended june  and  there were settlements under our commodity derivatives due to us amounting to  and  respectively  which are recorded as realized gain on commodity derivatives on our consolidated statements of operations 
the settlements were cumulative monthly payments due to us since the nymex natural gas price was lower than the floor natural gas prices ranging between and and the wti nymex oil price was lower than the floor oil prices ranging from to the cash flows relating to the derivative instruments are reflected in operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we obtained mark to market valuations used for our commodity derivatives from an external source and validated such valuations using quotes for exchange traded options with similar terms 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded the million in payments as derivative assets 
sfas no 
also provides that commodity derivatives be measured at fair value on the balance sheet date 
during the years ended june  and  we recognized unrealized loss on commodity hedges on our consolidated statements of operations amounting to  and  respectively  under unrealized loss on hedge contracts 
at june   our derivative assets totaled  of which  was considered long term 
if crude oil prices fell below our hedged crude oil price floor  we would save approximately  due to having the crude oil price floor hedge in place 
if natural gas prices fell below our hedged natural gas price floor  we would save approximately  due to having the natural gas price floor hedge in place
