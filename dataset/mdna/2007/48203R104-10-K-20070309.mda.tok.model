item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report on form k report  including the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains forward looking statements regarding future events and the future results of our company that are based on current expectations  estimates  forecasts  and projections about the industry in which we operate and the beliefs and assumptions of our management 
words such as expects  anticipates  targets  goals  projects  intends  plans  believes  seeks  estimates  variations of such words  and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are only predictions and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict 
therefore  actual results may differ materially and adversely from those expressed in any forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this report under the section entitled risk factors in item a of part i and elsewhere  and in other reports we file with the securities and exchange commission sec  specifically the most recent reports on form q 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
the information below has been adjusted to reflect the restatement of our financial results which is more fully described in the explanatory note immediately preceding part i  item  and in note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
the following discussion is based upon our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in the course of operating our business  we routinely make decisions as to the timing of the payment of invoices  the collection of receivables  the manufacturing and shipment of products  the fulfillment of orders  the purchase of supplies  and the building of inventory and spare parts  among other matters 
each of these decisions has some impact on the financial results for any given period 
in making these decisions  we consider various factors including contractual obligations  customer satisfaction  competition  internal and external financial targets and expectations  and financial planning objectives 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  pricing credits  warranty costs  allowance for doubtful accounts  impairment of long term assets  especially goodwill and intangible assets  contract manufacturer exposures for carrying and obsolete material charges  assumptions used in the valuation of stock based compensation  and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
overview of the results of operations to aid in understanding our operating results for each of the three years in the period ended december   we believe an overview of the significant events that affected those periods and a discussion of the nature of our operating expenses is helpful 
significant events business and market environment the year of marked our th anniversary and a year of considerable progress which culminated with record revenue results for both the year and in the fourth quarter 
in addition  standard poor s s p has added the company to the s p index as of the close of trading on june  during  there has been and continues to be consolidation in the telecommunications industry for example  the acquisitions of at t inc  mci  inc 
and bellsouth corporation and consolidation among the large vendors of telecommunications equipment and services  such as the combination of alcatel sa and lucent technologies inc and the acquisition of redback networks  inc 
by ericsson 
we believe our innovation and market momentum have also allowed us to build partnerships with other market leaders  which we announced in  including avaya inc  microsoft corporation  nec and symantec corporation 
our total installed base of products has grown to approximately billion across more than countries worldwide 
these numbers are the result of more than  units shipped to over  customers thanks to the help of more than  partners since our inception 

table of contents in  we had major next generation network ngn wins in the service provider marketplace  helping us to achieve an overall installed base of over  units of the t series in north america  emea and selected countries in asia 
we saw significant success in carriers selecting equipment for the core of their networks designed to provide multiple types of services  such as voice  data and video  so called multi play  a strategic focus for us and an important growth opportunity for the future 
we have also seen an increased level of interest in our slt portfolio and a growing number of service providers using our slt products for both managed service offerings and outsourced solutions for their customers 
in fact  the number of service providers buying our slt products increased from to we successfully delivered the products we planned to deliver in despite the risks associated with the long length of product development  testing and acceptance cycles involved with these products in these markets 
we have made good progress in and we are building a product portfolio in a market with solid demand for ip infrastructure 
restatement of previously issued financial statements in this form k as of and for the year ended december  the form k  we are restating our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and the related consolidated statements of operations  shareholders equity  and cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended december  and as a result of an independent stock option investigation commenced by the board of directors and audit committee 
this restatement is more fully described in note  restatement of consolidated financial statements  to consolidated financial statements and in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this form k will also reflect the restatement of selected consolidated financial data in item for the fiscal years ended december    and in addition  we are restating our unaudited quarterly financial information and financial statements for interim periods of  and unaudited condensed financial statements for the three months ended march  financial information included in the reports on form k  form q and form k filed by us prior to august   and the related opinions of our independent registered public accounting firm  and all earnings press releases and similar communications issued by us  prior to august  should not be relied upon and are superseded in their entirety by this report and other reports on form q and form k filed by us with the sec on or after august  stock option investigation on may   we issued a press release and form k announcing that we had received a request for information relating to our stock option granting practices from the us attorney s office for the eastern district of new york 
in the same press release and form k  we announced that our board of directors the board had directed the board s audit committee  comprised of outside directors  to conduct a review of our stock option granting practices 
on may   we received a letter from the sec indicating that the sec was conducting an inquiry regarding juniper networks 
the investigation was conducted with the assistance of independent counsel and forensic accountants collectively the investigative team 
the investigation focused on all stock option grants made to all employees  officers  directors and consultants during the period following our initial public offering ipo on june  to may  the relevant period 
in addition  the audit committee investigation involved testing and analyses of our hiring  termination  leave of absence  grant notification and exercise practices regarding stock options and certain issues regarding grants made before the ipo 
the scope of the investigation did not include a review of options granted by companies acquired by us 
all of the companies acquired by us  with one exception  were privately held companies 
none of the acquisitions was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
all of the acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method as provided by statement of financial standards no 
 business combinations and its predecessor accounting principles board opinion no 
 business combinations 
in connection with the investigation  more than  physical and electronic documents were reviewed and current and former directors  officers  employees and agents were interviewed 
on december   we announced key findings of the audit committee 
key findings of the audit committee are there were numerous instances in which grant dates were chosen with the benefit of hindsight as to the price of our stock  so as to give favorable exercise prices 
in this regard  the audit committee identified serious concerns regarding the actions of certain former management in connection with the stock option granting process formal documentation of stock option grants often lagged the referenced grant date grants were made by persons or committees who did not have the proper authority to make the grants in question management failed to exercise sufficient responsibility for the stock option granting process 
table of contents our ceo  scott kriens  received two stock option awards whose measurement dates for financial accounting purposes differ from the recorded grant dates for such awards 
however  both options were exchanged and cancelled unexercised in as part of a company wide option re pricing program 
mr 
kriens has not exercised any stock options since  approximately nine months before our ipo there were substantial changes to our granting procedures after june  and again in no grants subsequent to required new measurement dates there was no improper conduct by our compensation committee or board of directors regarding the granting of stock options by those bodies our audit committee expressed their continuing confidence in scott kriens and the current management of the company consistent with the accounting literature and recent guidance from the sec  we have organized the grants during the relevant period into categories based on grant type and the process by which the grant was finalized 
we analyzed the evidence from the audit committee s investigation related to each category including  but not limited to  physical documents  electronic documents  underlying electronic data about documents  and witness interviews 
based on the relevant facts and circumstances  we applied the then appropriate accounting standards to determine  for every grant within each category  the proper measurement date 
if the measurement date was not the originally assigned grant date  accounting adjustments were made as required  resulting in stock based compensation expense and related tax effects 
grants made by our board of directors or compensation committee to officers or directors we have concluded that the measurement dates of several grants to executive officers who were reporting persons as that term is defined under section of the securities exchange act of  as amended  officers and members of the board of directors made between june and june were incorrect 
in general  during the relevant period  the board or the compensation committee of the board made grants to officers and directors 
grants were sometimes approved at meetings of these bodies or by action by unanimous written consent 
there were several instances in which grants to officers or directors were given grant dates and corresponding exercise prices prior to the date on which formal corporate action making the grant was taken 
in general  this appears to have been done to make the grant date coincide with either a specific event  such as the appointment or re election of a director or with the purported date options were granted to non officers 
in these cases  we have determined that the correct measurement date is the date on which our board or compensation committee took the action to approve the grant 
we also identified instances in which grants to officers were granted effective upon a future event  such as the commencement of employment or closing of an acquisition 
in these cases  we have determined that the date of the future event is the correct measurement date for such grants 
we also identified instances where grants to officers were made by a body not authorized by our board to make grants to officers and were subsequently ratified by our board 
in those instances  we determined that the correct measurement date is the date on which such ratification occurred 
in connection with the application of these measurement principles  and after accounting for forfeitures  we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms 
in addition  there was one other grant to an officer where approval of such grant was not reflected in minutes of a meeting or an action by unanimous written consent of our board of directors or the compensation committee 
for that grant  the measurement date was determined based on the terms of the officer s offer letter and the date his employment commenced 
with respect to that grant  we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis over the award s vesting terms after accounting for forfeitures 
grants to non officers we have concluded that the measurement dates of a large number of grants to non officers during the period between june and december were incorrect 
our practice has been to grant stock options  except where prohibited  to nearly all full time employees in connection with joining us 
to facilitate the granting of options to our rapidly growing workforce  the board of directors established a stock option committee to grant options to non officer employees 
between june and june  the dates for a large number of grants made by our stock option committee were chosen with the benefit of hindsight as to the price of our stock  so as to give favorable exercise prices 
moreover  our stock option committee s process for finalizing and documenting these grants was often completed after the originally assigned grant date 
beginning with grants dated june   we implemented a number of new procedures and policies regarding the granting of options to non officer employees 
after that  we have concluded that the pattern of consciously looking back for the most favorable dates for the employees ceased 
however  the documentation and written approvals of grant dates still generally trailed the recorded grant dates 
based on all available facts and circumstances  the originally recorded 
table of contents measurement dates for the grants made by our stock option committee during the period from july through december can not be relied upon in isolation as the correct measurement dates 
in  we made additional changes to our procedures 
no grants in and required new measurement dates 
apb defines the measurement date for determining stock based compensation expense as the first date on which both the number of shares that an individual employee is entitled to receive and the option or purchase price  are known 
throughout the relevant period  the company s stock administration department entered the option grant information for grants made by the stock option committee into its equity edge stock administration system 
this system was used to monitor and administer our stock option program 
the data in equity edge were sent on a regular basis to designated brokers  allowing grantees to view their options information in their accounts via the internet 
for grants made by the stock option committee between june and december  where there is no other reliable objective evidence pointing to an earlier single specific date that the number of shares and the individuals entitled to receive them and the price had become final  we have determined the equity edge entry date to be the most reliable measurement date for calculating additional stock based compensation expense under apb using this measurement date  and after accounting for forfeitures  we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering million shares of common stock resulting in an incremental stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms 
in many of the cases where the equity edge entry date was used as the measurement date  the formal stock option committee granting documentation consisting of unanimous written consents or minutes and related lists of recipients  amounts and types of awards was not created or completed until a later date 
because the awards listed in the formal granting documentation did not differ from the grants entered into equity edge  the notice of the awards was made available to employees prior to the creation or completion of the granting documents  and because the completion of the documentation was treated as perfunctory  we determined that the equity edge entry date was the proper measurement date under apb rather than the date the stock option committee granting documentation was completed 
in a number of cases  there was reliable objective evidence pointing to a single specific date that the number of shares and the individuals entitled to receive them and the price had become final 
such evidence primarily consisted of electronic data indicating that the granting instrument and schedule were created prior to the equity edge entry date 
we also relied on other evidence such as emails or written agreements to determine the date certain options became final 
such evidence was used to determine the measurement dates for options for which we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering million shares of common stock resulting in incremental stock based compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms 
we also concluded that there were instances in which clerical errors or omissions regarding the persons to receive an award or the number of options to be granted were corrected after the date of award 
in the case of most additions made to correct omissions and other corrections that were not reflected on the grant documentation at the time of the applicable grant date or in documentation existing at the time of grant  we have determined that a new measurement date should be established 
we considered whether certain of such changes or additions should give rise to variable accounting treatment and concluded that such treatment was not appropriate because the grants represented independent decisions or events rather than a continuation or modification of the other grants 
we believe that the correct measurement date for these grants is the date stock administration entered the correction or addition into equity edge  except where objective evidence identifies an earlier date on which the correction was approved 
after accounting for forfeitures  we have adjusted the measurement of compensation cost for options covering million shares of common stock resulting in incremental stock based compensation of million on a pre tax basis over the respective awards vesting terms 
stock option grant modifications connected with terminations or leaves of absences and other matters compensation expense was also recognized as a result of modifications that were made to certain employee option grant awards in connection with certain employees terminations or leaves of absence 
typically such modifications related to extensions of the time employees could exercise options following their termination of employment or that enabled the employee to vest in additional shares in relation to a leave of absence 
for example  in connection with reductions in work force in and  we increased the period for affected employees to exercise their options from days to days 
we have incremental stock based compensation expense associated with such terminations or leaves of absence of million on a pre tax basis in the period of modification 
compensation expense of million on a pre tax basis was also recognized as a result of non employee grants to consultants in exchange for services and other matters 

table of contents judgment in light of the significant judgment used in establishing revised measurement dates  alternate approaches to those used by us could have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those recorded by us in the restatement 
we considered various alternative approaches 
for example  in those cases where the formal documentation of a grant was completed after the date the grant was entered in equity edge  an alternative measurement date to using the equity edge entry date could be the creation date of the documentation 
changing the measurement dates for grants made by our stock option committee from the equity edge entry date to the later of the electronic data creation date of the unanimous written consent or the related schedule of grants would cause the pre tax compensation charges of million discussed above to increase by approximately million 
conversely  where we established a new measurement date prior to the equity edge entry date for grants made by our stock option committee to non officers based on other evidence  such as the electronic data indicating the initial creation date of the granting instrument and schedule  an alternative measurement date could be the equity edge entry date 
changing the measurement dates for these grants by the stock option committee from a date prior to equity edge entry date to the equity edge entry would increase the million of the pre tax compensation charges discussed above by approximately million 
we believe that the approaches we used were the most appropriate under the circumstances 
summary of stock based compensation adjustments we adjusted the measurement dates for options covering a total of million  or  of the million shares of common stock covered by options granted during the relevant period 
the impact from on the consolidated statement of operations from recognizing stock based compensation expense through december  resulting from the investigation is summarized as follows in millions fiscal year pre tax expense after tax expense subtotal total in addition to the million recognized through fiscal  million of unamortized deferred compensation remained as of december   bringing the total incremental impact from the investigation to approximately million 
as required by sfas r  which was adopted on january   the unamortized deferred compensation of million has been reclassified to additional paid in capital  along with the unamortized deferred compensation for stock options assumed from past acquisitions  in our consolidated balance sheet 
beginning in  the incremental amortization resulting from the investigation is included in stock based compensation expense under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the incremental stock based compensation expense from the restatement of employee stock options was million  on a pre tax basis  for the year ended december  other matters after considering all available evidence  primarily the then current operating projections of future income  which remain appropriate  we have concluded that the previously recorded valuation allowance related to the tax benefit of stock options deductions should have been reversed in the fourth quarter of accordingly  we decreased the valuation allowance as of december  by million with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital 
the remaining valuation allowance balance of million relates to capital losses which will carry forward to offset future capital gains 
additionally  we misclassified the tax benefit from deductions from stock options assumed in acquisitions 
accordingly  we have reduced additional paid in capital for the years ended december  and by million and million  respectively  with a corresponding decrease to goodwill 
the total reduction to both additional paid in capital and goodwill as of december  was million 

table of contents because virtually all holders of options issued by us were not involved in or aware of the incorrect pricing  we have taken and intend to take actions to deal with certain adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of certain incorrectly priced options 
the primary adverse tax consequence is that incorrectly priced stock options vesting after december  may subject the option holder to a penalty tax under irc section a and  as applicable  similar penalty taxes under california and other state tax laws 
we recorded million as other charges in operating expense for in relation to these items and other tax related items 
we expect to incur future charges to resolve the adverse tax consequences of incorrectly priced options we misclassified the gains and losses from the retirement of our treasury shares in fiscal accordingly  we reduced our retained earnings accumulated deficit as of december  and by million with a corresponding increase to additional paid in capital 
the impact of recognizing additional stock compensation and other adjustments on each component of stockholders equity at the end of each year is summarized as follows in millions common stock additional paid in deferred stock net impact to fiscal year capital compensation accumulated deficit stockholders equity subtotal total nasdaq listing status in august  we received a nasdaq staff determination letter stating that  as a result of the delayed filing of our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june  the second quarter form q  we were not in compliance with the filing requirements for continued listing as set forth in marketplace rule c and were therefore subject to delisting from the nasdaq global select market 
in november  we received an additional letter from nasdaq of similar substance related to our form q for the quarter ended september  the third quarter form q 
in december  the nasdaq listing qualifications panel granted our request for continued listing  provided that we file a written summary of our audit committee s findings with nasdaq as well as the second quarter form q  the third quarter form q and any required restatements with the sec on or before february  in january  we received a notice from the nasdaq listing and hearings review council which advised us that any delisting determination by the nasdaq listing qualifications panel has been stayed pending further review by the review council 
we have been given until march  to submit additional information to assist the review council in their assessment of our listing status 
on february   we filed a written summary of our audit committee s findings with nasdaq 
in addition  on march   we filed the second quarter form q and the third quarter form q with the sec 
we consider that the filing of these materials has remedied our non compliance with marketplace rule c  subject to nasdaq s affirmative completion of its compliance protocols and its notification to us accordingly 
however  if nasdaq disagrees with our position or if the sec disagrees with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial impact of past stock option grants  there could be further delays in filing subsequent sec reports or other actions that might result in delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq global select market 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we recorded a  million non cash goodwill impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations within the slt segment to adjust the estimated carrying value of our goodwill for the three and six months ended june  the impairment of goodwill was primarily attributable to the decline in the company s market capitalization that occurred over a period of approximately six months prior to the impairment review and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in the forecasted future cash flows used in the income approach 
future impairment indicators  including further declines in our market capitalization or a decrease in revenue or profitability levels  could require additional impairment charges to be recorded 

table of contents we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
an asset is considered impaired if its carrying amount exceeds the undiscounted future net cash flow the asset is expected to generate 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment charge to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future net cash flows 
in and  we recorded impairment charges of million and million  respectively  related to certain kagoor purchased intangibles as a result of a significant reduction in our forecasted revenue associated with the session border control products 
stock based compensation we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r effective january   using the modified prospective transition method and  therefore  have not revised prior periods results 
during  we issued stock options to the members of our board outside directors and stock options  restricted stock units rsus and shares of common stock pursuant to equity incentive plans 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of certain unvested and out of the money stock options that had an exercise price per share equal to or greater than  all of which were previously granted under our stock option plans and that were outstanding on december  the options accelerated excluded options previously granted to certain employees  including all of the executive officers and the board of directors of juniper networks 
under sfas r  we recorded pre tax stock based compensation expense of million in compared to million in when we recognized stock based compensation expense under the intrinsic value recognition provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
beginning in may  we have adopted the equity incentive plan plan which provides for a maximum term of seven years from the grant date for non statutory stock options and for incentive stock options except that the maximum term is five years from the grant date for incentive stock options granted to a holder of more than of the company s stock 
the plan also provides for a defined option granting schedule for our outside directors 
details of the plan are described in note  stockholders equity  in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
stock repurchase activities in july  our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program 
this program authorized repurchases of up to million of our common stock 
in the first quarter of  we repurchased and retired  shares of common stock at an average price of per share as part of our common stock repurchase program 
no shares were repurchased after the three months ended march  as of december   a total of  common shares had been repurchased and retired since the inception of the program  equating to approximately million at an average price of per share 
in july  our board authorized a new stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to billion of our company s common stock 
in february  our board approved an increase of billion under this new share repurchase program 
coupled with the original billion approved in july  we are now authorized to repurchase up to billion of our common stock 
purchases under this plan will be subject to a review of the circumstances in place at the time 
acquisitions under the share repurchase program will be made from time to time as permitted by securities laws and other legal requirements 
the program may be discontinued at any time

nature of expenses we have an extensive distribution channel in place that we use to target new customers and increase sales 
we have made substantial investments in our distribution channel during  and most of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain operations are outsourced to independent contract manufacturers  accordingly  most of our cost of revenues consists of payments to our independent contract manufacturers for the standard product costs 
the independent contract manufacturers produce our products using design specifications  quality assurance programs and standards that we establish 
controls around manufacturing  engineering and documentation are conducted at our facilities in sunnyvale  california and westford  massachusetts 
our independent contract manufacturers have facilities primarily in canada  china  malaysia  and the united states 
we generally do not own the components and title to products transfers from the contract manufacturers to us and immediately to our customers upon shipment 
the contract manufacturers procure components based on our build forecasts and if actual component usage is lower than our forecasts  we may be  and have been in the past  liable for carrying or obsolete material charges 
employee related costs have historically been the primary driver of our operating expenses and we expect this trend to continue 
employee related costs include items such as wages  commissions  bonuses  vacation  benefits and travel 
we added over employees in primarily in engineering and customer service functions as a result of increased investment in customer service operations to support investment in the enterprise market 
in  we added employees across all functions primarily as a result of acquisitions 
we had   and  employees as of december   and  respectively 
facility and information technology departmental costs are allocated to other departments based on headcount 
these departmental costs have increased each of the last two years due to increases in headcount and facility leases resulting from acquisitions and additional infrastructure systems to support our growth 
we expect to further invest in our internal information technology infrastructure in research and development expenses include the costs of developing our products from components to prototypes to finished products  outside services for such services as certifications of new products  and expenditures associated with equipment used for testing 
several components of our research and development effort require significant expenditures  such as the development of new components and the purchase of prototype equipment  the timing of which can cause quarterly variability in our expenses 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
we plan to increase our investment in research and development during compared to to further advance our competitive advantage 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses include costs for promoting our products and services  demonstration equipment and advertisements 
these costs vary quarter to quarter depending on revenues  product launches and marketing initiatives 
we plan to continue our investment in sales and marketing activities in both direct and channel sales 
we will expand into new markets  particularly emerging markets  and continue to expand both our service provider and enterprise focus

general and administrative expenses include professional fees  bad debt provisions and other corporate expenses 
professional fees include legal  audit  tax  accounting and certain corporate strategic services 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates and assumptions on current facts  historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from management s estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
our products are integrated with software that is essential to the functionality of our equipment 
additionally  we provide unspecified upgrades and enhancements related to our integrated software through our maintenance contracts for most of its products 
accordingly  we accounts for revenue in accordance with statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  and all related interpretations 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery or performance has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
evidence of an arrangement generally consists of customer purchase orders and  in certain instances  sales contracts or agreements 
shipping terms and related documents  or written evidence of customer acceptance  when applicable  are used to verify delivery or performance 
we assess whether the sales price is fixed or determinable based on payment terms and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and the customer s payment history to us 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element using the residual method based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based on the price charged when the element is sold separately we then recognize revenue on each deliverable in accordance with our policies for product and service revenue recognition 
our ability to recognize revenue in the future may be affected if actual selling prices are significantly less than fair value 
in addition  our ability to recognize revenue in the future could be impacted by conditions imposed by our customers 
for sales to direct end users and value added resellers  we recognize product revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss  which is generally upon shipment 
for our end users and value added resellers  there are no significant obligations for future performance such as rights of return or pricing credits 
a portion of our sales are made through distributors under agreements allowing for pricing credits and or rights of return 
we recognize product revenue on sales made through these distributors upon sell through as reported to us by the distributors 
we recognize service revenue as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation 
we record reductions to revenue for estimated product returns and pricing adjustments  such as rebates and price protection  in the same period that the related revenue is recorded 
the amount of these reductions is based on historical sales returns and price protection credits  specific criteria included in rebate agreements  and other factors known at the time 
additional reductions to revenue would result if actual product returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of any of our customers was to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of its ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 

table of contents contract manufacturer liabilities 
we outsource most of our manufacturing  repair and supply chain management operations to our independent contract manufacturers and a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to them 
our independent contract manufacturers procure components and manufacture our products based on our demand forecasts 
these forecasts are based on our estimates of future demand for our products  which are in turn based on historical trends and an analysis from our sales and marketing organizations  adjusted for overall market conditions 
we establish reserves for carrying charges and obsolete material charges for excess components purchased based on historical trends 
if the actual component usage and product demand are significantly lower than forecasted  which may be caused by factors outside of our control  we have contractual liabilities and exposures with the independent contract manufacturers  such as carrying costs and obsolete material exposures  which would have an adverse impact on our gross margins and profitability 
warranty reserve 
we generally offer a one year warranty on all of our hardware products and a day warranty on the media that contains the software embedded in the products 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials and technical labor costs and associated overhead incurred in correcting any product failure 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce gross margins 
goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
goodwill is recorded as the difference  if any  between the aggregate consideration paid for an acquisition and the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact the amount and timing of future amortization  and the amount assigned to in process research and development is expensed immediately 
the value of our intangible assets  including goodwill  could be impacted by future adverse changes such as i future declines in our operating results  ii a decline in the valuation of technology company stocks  including the valuation of our common stock  iii significant slowdown in the worldwide economy or the networking industry or iv failure to meet the performance projections included in our forecasts of future operating results 
we evaluate these assets on an annual basis as of november or more frequently if we believe indicators of impairment exist 
in the process of our annual impairment review  we use the market approach as well as the income approach methodology of valuation that includes the discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our intangible assets 
significant management judgment is required in the forecasts of future operating results that are used in the discounted cash flow method of valuation 
the estimates we have used are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business 
it is possible  however  that the plans and estimates used may be incorrect 
if our actual results  or the plans and estimates used in future impairment analyses  are lower than the original estimates used to assess the recoverability of these assets  we could incur additional impairment charges 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r 
under the provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes merton bsm option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly subjective assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the bsm model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas r  we also adopted the single approach method for valuing our stock based awards as well as the straight line method for amortizing the related stock based compensation expense 
in connection with our restatement of the consolidated financial statements  we have applied judgment in choosing whether to revise measurement dates and if revised which measurement date to select for prior option grants 
information regarding the restatement  including ranges of possible additional stock based compensation expense if other measurement dates had been selected for certain grants  is set forth above under restatement of previously issued financial statements and in note  restatement of consolidated financial statements in notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k 
income taxes 
estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences and carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized or settled 
we regularly assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be realized from recoverable income taxes or recovered from future taxable income based on the realization criteria set forth under sfas  accounting for income taxes  and record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe to be more likely than not realizable 
we believe it is more likely than not that forecasted income together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event 
table of contents that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if we subsequently realize deferred tax assets that were previously determined to be unrealizable  the respective valuation allowance would be reversed  resulting in a positive adjustment to earnings or a decrease in goodwill in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we recognize potential liabilities based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes will be due 
if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be unnecessary  the reversal of the liabilities may result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary 
if our estimate of tax liabilities is less than the amount ultimately assessed  a further charge to expense would result 
litigation and settlement costs 
from time to time  we are involved in disputes  litigation and other legal actions 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters  however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation  and we cannot assure you that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation and or substantial settlement charges 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may require us to make royalty payments  which could adversely impact gross margins in future periods 
if any of those events were to occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
we record a charge equal to at least the minimum estimated liability for litigation costs or a loss contingency only when both of the following conditions are met i information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and ii the range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation may be materially different from our estimates  which could result in the need to record additional expenses 
loss contingencies 
we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required

this success was partially offset by a pause in the build out of ngns and associated purchase decisions  particularly in japan  as major carriers prepare for the next stage of bandwidth and services expansion  and a large product revenue deferral for products shipped to verizon that is expected to be recognized in infrastructure product net revenue increased from to  primarily due to the increase in revenues from service providers and enterprises as a result of significant success selling into the broadband and core networks for the service providers across the world and the recognition in the market place of juniper networks world class service provider solutions 
slt products accounted for million or of our total product revenue in and million or of total net product revenues during slt product net revenue increased million or from to due to a growing demand and brand recognition for our security products from large enterprises and the us federal government 
in addition  the new products announced in and those added to our portfolio through the various acquisitions in contributed to this increase 
in addition  we experienced good success in selling slt products to service providers for both their own it infrastructure and resale 
our slt product revenue increase in was primarily driven by the increased demands in security products by the enterprise market

a majority of our service revenue is earned from customers who purchase our products and enter into service contracts that are typically for one year renewable periods 
the increases in support service revenue were primarily due to the additional technical support service contract initiations associated with higher product sales  which have resulted in increased renewal and a larger installed base of equipment being serviced 
these contracts are typically for services such as hour customer support  non specified updates and hardware repairs 
we recognize revenue from service contracts as the services are completed or ratably over the period of the obligation

of the total kagoor purchase price  million was allocated to ipr d 
none of the acorn or redline purchase prices were allocated to ipr d 
in  million was allocated to ipr d from the netscreen acquisition and was expensed during the year 
projects that qualify as ipr d represent those that have not yet reached technological feasibility and which have no alternative future use 
technological feasibility is defined as being equivalent to a beta phase working prototype in which there is no remaining risk relating to the development 
at the time of acquisition  funk  peribit  kagoor  and netscreen had multiple ipr d efforts under way for certain current and future product lines 
for funk  these efforts included development of new versions for the steel belted radius sbr  sbr high availability ha  and mobile ip module mim ii products all related to the radius product offering 
ipr d as of the acquisition date also included development of new versions for endpoint assurance  proxy remote control  and odyssey product families 
at the time of the funk acquisition  it was estimated that these development efforts will be completed over the next four months at an estimated cost of approximately million 
for peribit  these efforts included the development of next versions of software for the sequence reducer sr family  sequence mirror sm family  the central management system cms products  as well as a hardware program for both the sr and sm families

for netscreen  these efforts included integrating secure routers with embedded encryption chips  as well as other functions and features such as next generation internet protocol ip  wireless and digital subscriber line connectivity and voice over ip capability 
we utilized the discounted cash flow dcf method to value the ipr d  using rates ranging from to  depending on the estimated useful life of the technology 
in applying the dcf method  the value of the acquired technology was estimated by discounting to present value the free cash flows expected to be generated by the products with which the technology is associated  over the remaining economic life of the technology 
to distinguish between the cash flows attributable to the underlying technology and the cash flows attributable to other assets available for generating product revenues  adjustments were made to provide for a fair return to fixed assets  working capital  and other assets that provide value to the product lines 
at the time of the netscreen acquisition  it was estimated that these development efforts would be completed over the next eighteen months at an estimated cost of approximately million

infrastructure operating segment infrastructure segment net revenues increased from to primarily due to increases in revenue from higher end infrastructure chassis products and increased penetration by our core and edge router portfolio as a result service providers acquiring products for their ngns and multi play service offerings 
in addition we believe there is increased demand for our products due to the adoption and expansion of ip networks as a result of peer to peer interaction  increased broadband usage  video  iptv and an increasing reliance on the network as a mission critical business tool in the strategies of our ip customers  and of their enterprise customers 
infrastructure segment net revenues increased from to due to the adoption and expansion of ip networks by our customers in order to reduce total operating costs and to be able to offer multiple services over a single network 
we track infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped to analyze customer trends and indicate areas of potential network growth 
our infrastructure product platforms are essentially modular  with the chassis serving as the base of the platform 
each chassis has a certain number of slots that are available to be populated with components we refer to as modules or interfaces 
the modules are the components through which the router receives incoming packets of data from a variety of transmission media 
the physical connection between a transmission medium and a module is referred to as a port 
the number of ports on a module varies widely depending on the functionality and throughput offered by the module 
chassis revenue units represent the number of chassis on 
table of contents which revenue was recognized during the period 
the following table shows infrastructure revenue units recognized and ports shipped years ended december  infrastructure chassis revenue units infrastructure ports shipped chassis revenue units increased from to due primarily to the sales of higher end t series and m series products and the inclusion of the chassis units related to a acquisition  partially offset by decreases in sales of lower end e series and m series products

liquidity and capital resources overview we have funded our business by issuing securities and through our operating activities 
the following table shows our capital resources in millions as of december  working capital cash and cash equivalents short term investments long term investments restricted cash working capital increased million from to mainly due to cash provided by operating activities and investing activities  partially offset by cash used in financing activities 
the significant components of our working capital are cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and accounts receivable  reduced by accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue

however  it is possible that we may need to raise additional funds to finance our activities beyond the next months or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  assets  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling equity or debt securities to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money from financial institutions 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
there are no transactions  arrangements  and other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of our requirements for capital resources  except the billion stock repurchase program approved by the board of directors as described below 
if we were to purchase billion of our common stock  we would significantly reduce our working capital and we may elect to obtain additional debt or credit facilities to fund the repurchases

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to fasb statement  accounting for income taxes  including uncertain tax positions 
under fin a company will recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
fin clarifies how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized  provides guidance as to the timing of the de recognition of previously recognized tax benefits and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits 
fin also addresses when a company should record interest and penalties related to tax positions and how the interest and penalties may be classified within the income statement and presented in the balance sheet 
differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to and after the adoption of fin would be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
we are required to adopt fin as of january  upon adoption  there is a possibility that the cumulative effect would result in an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
in addition  the application of fin may increase our future effective tax rates and its future intra period effective tax rate volatility 
we are currently evaluating the effect of the adoption of fin on our consolidated financial statements and are not yet in a position to determine such effects 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement sfas no 
 fair value measurement  sfas 
sfas provides enhanced guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the guidance clarifies the principle for assessing fair value based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data such as companies own data 
under this guidance  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating sfas and expect to adopt this guidance beginning on january  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
at any time  a rise in interest rates could have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
conversely  declines in interest rates could have a material impact on interest earnings of our investment portfolio 
we do not currently hedge these interest rate exposures

the modeling technique used measures the changes in fair value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points bps  bps and bps  which are representative of the historical movements in the federal funds rate 
foreign currency risk and foreign exchange forward contracts it is our policy to use derivatives to partially offset our market exposure to fluctuations in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into derivatives for speculative or trading purposes 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate transaction gains and losses generated by certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
these derivatives are carried at fair value with changes recorded in other income expense 
changes in the fair value of these derivatives are largely offset by re measurement of the underlying assets and liabilities 
these foreign exchange contracts have maturities between one and two months 
periodically  we use foreign currency forward and or option contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency transactions relating to operating expenses 
these derivatives are designated as cash flow hedges and have maturities of less than one year 
the effective portion of the derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  and upon occurrence of the forecasted transaction  is subsequently reclassified into the consolidated statements of operations line item to which the hedged transaction relates 
we record any ineffectiveness of the hedging instruments  which was immaterial during the years ended december   and  in other income expense in our results of operations
