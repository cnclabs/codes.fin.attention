item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our objective is to provide water services in areas where the supply of potable water is scarce and where the use of reverse osmosis ro technology to produce potable water is economically feasible 
we intend to increase revenues by developing new business opportunities both within our current service areas and in new areas 
we expect to maintain operating efficiencies by continuing to focus on our successful business model and by properly executing our equipment maintenance and water loss mitigation programs 
we also believe that many caribbean basin and adjacent countries  being water scarce  present opportunities for operation of our plants in favorable regulatory environments 
our operations and activities are conducted at thirteen plants in four countries the cayman islands  belize  barbados  and the bahamas and in three business segments retail  bulk and services 
our affiliate  oc bvi sells bulk water to a customer in the british virgin islands 
the following table sets forth the comparative combined production capacity of our retail  bulk and affiliate operations as of december of each year 
comparative operations location plants capacity location plants capacity cayman islands cayman islands bahamas bahamas belize belize barbados barbados british virgin islands british virgin islands total total in millions of us gallons per day 
owned and operated by our affiliate oc bvi 
does not include oc bvi s recently constructed bar bay plant that is currently not in use 
cayman islands we have been operating our business on grand cayman island since and have been using ro technology to convert seawater to potable water since there is a limited natural supply of fresh water on the cayman islands 
we currently have an exclusive license from the cayman islands government to process potable water from seawater and then sell and distribute that water by pipeline to seven mile beach and west bay  grand cayman 
our operations consist of six reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants which provide water to approximately  retail residential and commercial customers within a government licensed area and bulk water sales to the water authority cayman 
our pipeline system in the cayman islands covers the seven mile beach and west bay areas of grand cayman and consists of approximately miles of polyvinyl chloride pipe 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons million us gallons of water to our retail water 
table of contents customers and million us gallons million us gallons to our bulk customers in grand cayman 
belize our belize operation  which was acquired on july   consists of one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant on ambergris caye  belize  central america capable of producing  us gallons per day 
we sell water to one customer  belize water services limited  which then distributes the water through its own distribution system to residential  commercial and tourist properties on ambergris caye 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons million us gallons of water to our bulk water customer in belize 
bahamas our bimini plant is capable of producing  us gallons per day and provides potable water to bimini sands resort and to the bimini beach hotel 
during  we supplied approximately million us gallons million us gallons of water to our retail water customer in bimini  bahamas 
as a result of our acquisition of cw bahamas in august  we acquired an additional reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant in the bahamas 
cw bahamas produces potable water from two reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants  the windsor plant and the blue hills plant  in new providence and has a total installed capacity of million us gallons per day 
cw bahamas supplies water on a take or pay basis to the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas under long term build  own and operate supply agreements 
during  we supplied approximately billion us gallons million us gallons of water to the water and sewerage corporation 
barbados the barbados operation consists of a service agreement to operate one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plant with a capacity of million us gallons per day  which is owned by sandy lane resort 
this plant is operated by desalco barbados  the wholly owned subsidiary of desalco 
the plant provides water to the sandy lane resort and during we produced approximately million us gallons million us gallons 
this service agreement expired in january but has been extended through june british virgin islands we are in the market in the british virgin islands with an equity position in  and shared management of  oc bvi 
this affiliate produces potable water from one reverse osmosis seawater conversion plants in tortola 
this plant has a total installed capacity of million us gallons per day and provides water to the department of water and sewerage of the ministry of communications and works of the government of the british virgin islands 
during  oc bvi supplied approximately million us gallons million us gallons of water to its bulk water customer 
critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as those policies critical to our business operations and the understanding of results of operations 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  
table of contents we evaluate our estimates  including those related to trade accounts receivable  goodwill and other intangible assets and property  plant and equipment 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess costs over fair value of the assets of an acquired business 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a business combination accounted for as a purchase and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate the possible impairment of goodwill 
management identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units 
we determine the fair value of each reporting unit and compare it to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we are required to perform the second step of the impairment test  as this is an indication that the reporting unit goodwill may be impaired 
in this step  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all the assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
if the implied fair value is less than its carrying amount  the impairment loss is recorded 
our annual tests have resulted in no goodwill impairment 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation commences in the month the asset is placed in service and is calculated using a straight line method with an allowance for estimated residual value 
rates are determined based on the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings to years plant and equipment to years distribution system to years office furniture  fixtures and equipment to years vehicles to years leasehold improvements lesser of years or operating lease term lab equipment to years additions to property  plant and equipment are comprised of the cost of the contracted services  direct labor and materials 
assets under construction are recorded as additions to property  plant and equipment upon completion of a project 
improvements that significantly increase the value of property  plant and equipment are capitalized 
maintenance  repairs and minor improvements are charged to expense as incurred 
construction in progress the cost of borrowed funds directly attributable to the acquisition and construction of qualifying assets  which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to be ready for their intended use  are added to the cost of those assets until such time as the assets are 
table of contents substantially ready for use or sale 
trade accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments 
management continuously evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances based on estimates of the level of actual write offs that might be experienced 
these estimates are based on  among other things  comparisons of the relative age of accounts and consideration of actual write off history 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited quarterly results of operations for the eight quarters ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly such quarterly information 
for the year ended december  first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter total revenue gross profit net income diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter total revenue gross profit net income diluted earnings per share results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included under part ii  item of this annual report year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated results net income for the year ended december  was  per share on a fully diluted basis  up from the  per share reported for the year ended december  the earnings improvement for reflects a substantial increase in consolidated gross profit attributable to revenue growth 
consolidated revenues for amounted to  as compared to  for additional revenues were earned by all three business segments as retail sales  bulk sales and services revenues for exceeded those for consistent with the growth in revenues  consolidated gross profit increased from  in to  in please refer to results by segment below for a more detailed discussion of our revenues and gross profit for the year ended december  
table of contents general and administrative g a expenses were  and  on a consolidated basis for and  respectively 
the majority of the increase in g a expenses for is attributable to personnel costs  which exceeded those for the prior year by approximately million 
the personnel costs for our accounting  engineering and supply chain support office subsidiary in deerfield beach  florida that opened in november grew by approximately  from to and our cayman subsidiaries incurred approximately  more in personnel costs in as a result of incremental hires  pay raises and bonus accruals 
the overall growth in g a expense also reflects increases in depreciation expense  insurance expense and directors expenses of approximately   and  respectively and the other various g a costs for our deerfield beach office  which exceeded those for by approximately  interest expense for was  as compared to  for the greater interest expense for reflects the increase in average outstanding borrowings in which were incurred to complete construction of our blue hills plant in the bahamas and the cessation of the capitalization of interest costs for our blue hills plant upon the commissioning of that plant in july results by segment retail segment revenues generated by our retail water operations were  and  for and  respectively 
the increase in revenues from to resulted from increased demand in grand cayman  particularly in our seven mile beach service area 
by volume of gallons sold  our retail sales increased in when compared to during our retail sales were adversely affected by the continuing impact of hurricane ivan  which damaged a number of hotel and tourist properties in september  thereby reducing the level of tourism and the demand for water for most of many of the damaged properties have reopened  new properties have been constructed  and consequently water demand in our seven mile beach service area exceeded that for in the retail segment generated  in gross profit of sales  as compared to  of sales in total gross profit for retail sales increased as compared to because of the increased retail water sales 
retail segment gross profit as a percentage of sales improved from to as output and revenues for the retail plants grew at a rate faster than overall plant operating costs  as a significant portion of these costs are relatively fixed 
consistent with prior periods we record all non direct g a expenses in our retail business segment and do not allocate any of these non direct costs to our other two business segments 
retail g a expenses for were  up from the  in retail g a for the personnel costs of our accounting  engineering and supply chain support subsidiary in deerfield beach  florida exceeded those for by approximately  and the other g a expenses for this subsidiary exceeded s by approximately  as this subsidiary commenced its activities in the fourth quarter of the remainder of the growth in g a expenses for the retail segment consists primarily of personnel costs for the other retail segment subsidiaries arising from incremental hires  pay raises and bonuses 
bulk segment bulk water sales for and were  and  respectively 
the growth in bulk sales from to of  or  reflects added production capacity and reduced production penalties at the windsor plant which was temporarily expanded from october to august which increased sales for that plant by  from in addition  we recognized 
table of contents incremental sales of  for attributable to the opening our blue hills plant in july and increased sales of  to our customer  water authority cayman  in the cayman islands 
the bulk water sales includes revenues to the water and sewerage corporation of the bahamas wsc and the water authority cayman totaling   and   respectively  which represented and of total revenues  respectively 
the gross profit on our bulk water sales declined from of sales for the nine months ended september  to of sales for the year ended december  this decline in overall gross profit from the end of the third quarter to year end represents the impact of approximately million in sales from our blue hills plant during the three months ended december  made at essentially a break even gross margin 
our agreement with the wsc for the blue hills plant contains a non revenue water nrw component that requires us to reduce the amount of water lost by the public water distribution system on new providence island over a one year period by million us gallons 
until such time as we can demonstrate to the wsc that we have achieved this reduction  we are required to provide million us gallons of water per day to the wsc from the blue hills plant at no cost to the wsc 
the costs associated with providing this free water to wsc are significant to overall plant operating costs and greatly reduced the overall gross margin on total water sales from the blue hills plant during the fourth quarter of the lack of gross margin on these sales made by the blue hills facility is attributable to higher operational costs related to plant start up and our current obligations with respect to the nrw reduction component of the blue hills contract 
we are taking aggressive actions to address these start up issues and to complete the nrw project in order to reduce operating costs and improve the profitability of the blue hills operation 
however the gross profit of our bulk water segment in future periods may continue to be adversely affected by the results for our blue hills plant 
bulk segment gross profit for was  or of sales  as compared to  or of sales  for in total bulk segment gross profit dollars increased as compared to the prior year because of the increased bulk water sales 
gross profit for bulk water sales improved as a percentage of sales from to primarily due to operational efficiencies associated with the use of containerized units in the temporary expansion of the windsor plant and to a lesser extent of the lower valley plant 
bulk segment g a expenses for and were  and  respectively 
the overall increase in bulk g a reflects increases in a variety of expense categories including personnel costs  insurance  and professional fees 
services segment our revenues from services provided were  as compared to  for service revenues rose from to as a result of increased engineering and design fees received from oc bvi in connection with the construction of the bar bay plant 
the gross profit of  for exceeded the gross profit reported for this segment for by  as a result of increased design fees while maintaining relatively fixed operating costs 
g a expenses for the services segment from to remained relatively unchanged at  and  respectively 
net income net income increased from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue total revenue increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in revenue from retail increased from  to  in when compared to this variation primarily reflected increased demand by residential customers in grand cayman  
table of contents particularly in the west bay service area  which experienced a increase in volume sales 
we believe many residents relocated to west bay in the wake of hurricane ivan s damage in late revenue from bulk operations increased from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in this increase was primarily the twofold result of additional consumption by our customer water authority cayman in the cayman islands and to a lesser extent increased consumption by our customer in belize 
in addition  although we did experience higher revenue related to the recovery of energy costs at our windsor plant in the bahamas  this was more than offset by pricing adjustments of approximately  in and  in related to reduced deliveries associated with the fouling of ro membrane elements throughout and services revenue increased from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in due to additional engineering fees charged to our affiliate  oc bvi  for work on the bar bay plant in tortola  british virgin islands 
cost of sales total cost of sales increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in cost of retail sales increased from  to  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in due to additional variable costs associated with the increase in sales 
cost of bulk sales increased from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in the increase in cost of sales is disproportionately higher than the corresponding increase in revenues due to the additional operating costs related to fouling of ro membrane elements and higher energy costs at our windsor plant in the bahamas 
cost of sales from services increased by  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in due to additional payroll expense and employee recruiting fees associated with the general expansion of our business 
gross profit the gross profit margin decreased from to for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in  for the reasons explained above 
general and administrative expense total g a expense increased by  from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in g a was and of total revenue for the respective years ended december  and retail g a increased by  from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in due to i an additional  in audit  accounting and legal fees involving the sarbanes oxley internal control review and certification process  ii increase in the number of director s meetings held during the year  iii increased legal fees associated with our 
table of contents enhanced level of contract bidding  contract awards and financing initiatives and iv a general increase in expenses to support our higher level of activity 
our policy is and has been to allocate all non direct corporate g a to the retail segment 
bulk g a decreased  from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in services g a decreased  to  for the year 
other income expense total other income increased by from  to  for the year ended december  when compared to the same period in although interest expense increased  due to rising libor rates  this was more than offset by an increase in both profit sharing and equity income from the investment in oc bvi  which has benefited from higher sales since the customer made significant repairs to their distribution system

we made  in scheduled payments on our debt and paid dividends of million during the year 
financial position our total assets increased from approximately million at december  to million at december  accounts receivable at december  were approximately million  up almost million from december  this increase in accounts receivable reflects incremental receivables of approximately million for cw bahamas resulting from the added revenues generated by our blue hills plant 
our inventory growth from approximately million at december  to approximately million at december  represents purchases for our blue hills plant and to support our overall increase in revenues 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased by approximately  from december  to december  due to prepaid insurance premiums and a utility deposit paid for the blue hills plant 
the substantial fluctuation in construction in progress and property  plant and equipment balances from december  to december  reflects the added construction costs incurred during the year for our blue hills plant and the completion of this plant during the quarter ended september  under the contract for our blue hills plant  we were required to supply and install materials and equipment and to provide technical services in order to reduce the amount of water lost by the distribution

in addition to the commitments in the table above  we estimate the costs as of december  to complete the expansion of the north sound and governor s harbour plants on grand cayman to be approximately million and project that these costs will be incurred through the first quarter of 
table of contents we have two contracts  one for our windsor plant and one for our blue hills plant  to supply water to the water and sewer corporation of the government of the bahamas wsc 
each contract requires us to guarantee delivery of a minimum quantity of water per week 
if we do not meet this minimum  we are required to pay to the wsc for the difference between the minimum and actual gallons delivered at a per gallon rate equal to the price per gallon that wsc is currently paying us under the contract 
the blue hills and windsor contracts expire in and  respectively and require us to deliver million imperial gallons and million imperial gallons  respectively  of water each week 
we are required to provide the wsc with performance and operating guarantees  in the form of bank issued performance bonds  to secure any payments we may be required to make under the minimum delivery requirements of these contracts 
as of december   a million performance bond was outstanding for the windsor plant  and a million construction bond was outstanding for the blue hills plant and we expect to arrange the issuance of a performance bond for approximately million for the blue hills plant sometime during in january  our recently formed affiliate  cw bermuda  signed a contract with the government of bermuda to design  build and operate a desalination plant at tynes bay on the northern coast of bermuda 
the project includes the desalination plant which will have a production capacity of  us gallons per day  a standby electrical power plant and miles of main water delivery pipelines 
the plant design provides for a future increase in production capacity to million us gallons per day 
cw bermuda will construct and operate the plant 
under the terms of the contract  cw bermuda is required to complete construction and commission the plant and pipeline by mid december and will operate the plant for at least months after commissioning 
we have agreed to loan cw bermuda up to million to complete construction of the project and have entered into a management agreement with cw bermuda to oversee construction of the plant and to operate the plant once it is completed 
the total revenues to be received under this contract for the desalination plant and management agreement are estimated to be approximately million

as a result of the increasing capital requirements to support our growth and other considerations  our board has recently modified our dividend policy  and we will no longer seek to maintain a dividend payout 
table of contents based upon a percentage range of trailing earnings 
payment of any future cash dividends will depend upon our earnings  financial condition  cash flows  capital requirements and other factors our board deems deem relevant in determining the amount and timing of such dividends 
dividend reinvestment and common stock purchase plan 
this program is available to our shareholders  who may reinvest all or a portion of their common cash dividends into shares of common stock at prevailing market prices 
it also accepts optional cash payments to purchase additional shares at prevailing market prices 
impact of inflation under the terms of our cayman islands license and our water sales agreements in belize  bahamas  british virgin islands and barbados  our water rates are automatically adjusted for inflation on an annual basis  subject to temporary exceptions 
we  therefore  believe that the impact of inflation on our net income  measured in consistent dollars  will not be material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk credit risk we are not exposed to significant credit risk on retail customer accounts in the cayman islands and bimini  bahamas  as our policy is to cease supply of water to customers whose accounts are more than days overdue 
our primary exposure to credit risk is from bulk water sales customers in belize  the islands of the bahamas  the british virgin islands  barbados and the cayman islands 
in addition  the entire balance of our loan receivable is due from the water authority cayman 
also  we have loaned million to oc bvi which is due to be repaid on june  we may elect to extend the maturity date on this loan interest rate risk we are not exposed to significant interest rate risk 
the annual interest rates on our series a bonds and bonds are fixed at and  respectively  and the remainder of our outstanding debt was repaid in march foreign exchange risk all of our foreign currencies have fixed exchanged rates to the us dollar 
if any of these fixed exchange rates become a floating exchange rate  however  our results of operation could be adversely affected
