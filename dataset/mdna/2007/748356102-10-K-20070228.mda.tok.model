general and administrative expenses increased due to higher labor costs and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
production taxes per unit decreased with lower sales prices on natural gas  increased incentive tax credits related to well drilling and production enhancement projects  and adjustments to prior estimates 
most production taxes are based on a fixed percentage of commodity sales prices 
questar e p exploration expense increased million in compared to the increase was primarily due to expenses for unsuccessful exploratory wells 
questar e p plugged and abandoned the deep exploratory portion of the stewart point well on the pinedale anticline after failing to establish commercial production in the hilliard and rock springs formations 
the company recorded a million charge related to abandonment of the deep portion of the well  which was subsequently re completed as a commercial well in the lance pool 
exploration expense increased million in compared to the expense increase was due to increased exploratory seismic acquisition expenditures in the midcontinent and uinta basin 
abandonment and impairment expense decreased million in compared to and declined million in compared to the amount included million of expense due to a well with collapsed casing and million for an aban doned coal bed methane project

in  the wyoming oil and gas conservation commission approved acre density drilling for lance pool wells on about  acres of market resources  acre gross pinedale leasehold 
the area approved for increased density corresponds to the currently estimated productive limits of market resources core acreage in the field 
with acre density drilling  the company currently believes that up to wells will be required to fully develop the lance pool on its acreage 
uinta basin during  the company drilled or participated in wasatch and upper mesaverde gas wells  four horizontal and one vertical green river formation oil wells  and four deeper blackhawk  mancos and dakota formations gas wells on its core acreage block 
as of december   questar e p had drilled five wells in the flat rock and wolf flat areas in the southern portion of the uinta basin  including two wells on its  gross acre ute tribe exploration and development agreement lands and three wells on its state of utah leasehold  and was drilling another well at year end 
questar form k rockies legacy in the vermillion basin on the southwestern wyoming northwestern colorado state line  market resources continues to evaluate the potential of several formations under the company s  net leasehold acres 
as of december   the company had recompleted two older wells  drilled and completed new wells  and two were waiting on completion 
the targets are the baxter shale  which extends across a  foot gross interval from about  feet deep to about  feet deep on most of the company s leasehold in the basin  and the deeper frontier and dakota tight sand formations at depths down to  feet 
midcontinent questar e p continued a two rig infill development project in the elm grove field in northwest louisiana as it operated or participated in eight new wells that were completed in the fourth quarter of the company participated in the completion of wells in elm grove field in in  questar e p also acquired interests in producing wells in nine spacing units in the elm grove field

gas management gas management  market resources gas gathering and processing services business  grew net income to million in from million in and million in gas processing plant margin grew from million in to million in gathering volumes increased million mmbtu to million mmbtu in due primarily to expanding pinedale production and new projects serving third parties in the uinta basin 
total gathering margins increased despite increased start up costs associated with the pinedale liquids gathering and transportation facilities 
to reduce processing margin risk  gas management has restructured a number of its processing agreements with producers from keep whole contracts to fee based contracts 
a keep whole contract protects producers from frac spread risk while fee based contracts eliminate commodity price risk for the plant owner 
in  revenues from keep whole contracts benefited from a increase in realized ngl sales prices versus the prior year period 
revenues from fee based contracts were impacted by a increase in processing volumes offset by a decrease in the average rate charged per mmbtu processed compared with to further reduce margin volatility associated with keep whole contracts  gas management began managing ngl price risk in by using forward sales contracts 
forward sales contracts increased ngl revenues by million in and decreased ngl revenues million in income before income tax from gas management s interest in rendezvous was million for compared to million in and million in rendezvous provides gas gathering services for the pinedale and jonah producing areas 
gas management continues to invest in additional gas gathering and processing and liquids handling facilities to serve growing equity and third party production in its core areas of the pinedale and jonah fields in western wyoming and the uinta basin in eastern utah 
gas management completed its condensate and produced water gathering and transportation facilities on market resources pinedale anticline leasehold in november in time to satisfy blm conditions for expanded winter access 
gas management entered into an agreement with a third party producer to gather  compress and process gas in the uinta basin 
under terms of the fee based agreement  the company constructed gas compression facilities and expanded its existing red wash gas plant to process an additional mmcf per day of raw gas 
the processed gas and liquids are redelivered to the producer 
the new facilities were in service at the end of the third quarter gas management has formed a joint venture with the ute indian tribe and another industry participant to build a gas gathering system for the flat rock area in southern uinta basin

in the second quarter of  questar pipeline began operating a lateral to an electric generation power plant with a capacity of mdth per day 
in the fourth quarter of  questar pipeline completed an expansion of its southern system  which added capacity of mdth per day 
on january   questar pipeline subsidiary  questar overthrust pipeline  placed in service an interconnection with kern river gas transmission company that added capacity of mdth per day 
each of these expansion projects was fully subscribed with long term contracts 
questar gas is questar pipeline s largest transportation customer with contracts for mdth per day  including mdth per day for winter peaking service 
the majority of questar gas transportation contracts extend through mid questar pipeline primary storage facility is clay basin in eastern utah 
this facility is subscribed under long term contracts 
in addition  to clay basin  questar pipeline also owns and operates three smaller aquifer gas storage facilities 
questar gas has contracted for of firm storage capacity at clay basin for terms extending from one to years and of the firm storage capacity at the aquifer facilities for terms extending for years 
questar pipeline charges ferc approved transportation and storage rates that are based on straight fixed variable rate design 
under this rate design  all fixed costs of providing service including depreciation and return on investment are recovered through the demand charge 
about of questar pipeline costs are fixed and recovered through these demand charges 
questar pipeline s earnings are driven primarily by demand revenues from firm shippers 
since only about of operating costs are recovered through volumetric charges  changes in transportation volumes do not have a significant impact on earnings 
ngl revenues increased in over due to higher prices and higher volumes offset by a million adjustment due to a resolution of a liquid sharing arrangement in a fuel gas reimbursement proceeding 
the ngl revenues were million higher than due to higher prices and volumes and million because of the adjustment

clay basin storage questar pipeline conducts periodic pressure tests on its clay basin storage facility 
beginning with a test in april  the company noted a discrepancy between the book volumes of cushion gas at clay basin and the volumes implied by pressure data 
questar pipeline retained a reservoir consultant to model the reservoir and determine the size and cause of the discrepancy 
the company conducted six additional pressure tests from april to october to validate the model 
the reservoir model indicates from to bcf of gas may be missing from clay basin  with the most likely amount of bcf 
the cumulative gas loss is due to imprecision inherent in measurement of large injection and withdrawal volumes as well as reservoir heterogeneity that impacts storage reservoir performance 
the cushion gas loss represents of the volume of gas cycled in and out of the reservoir over the past years 
there is no indication that the reservoir is leaking 
the clay basin reservoir is functioning as expected to meet customer requirements 
questar pipeline is discussing with its firm storage customers the recording of the loss of gas as a reduction of native gas remaining in the reservoir and various tariff changes 
this accounting treatment would not impact questar pipeline net income 
alternatively  the ferc may require questar pipeline to adjust recoverable cushion gas  and reduce earnings by about million after tax

the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported results of operations and financial position 
the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of complexity and judgment on the part of management 
gas and oil reserves gas and oil reserve estimates require significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  production history  and economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and other taxes  capital expenditures and remedial costs 
the subjective decisions and variances in data for various fields make these estimates less precise than other estimates included in the financial statement disclosures 
for  revisions of reserve estimates  other than revisions related to pinedale increased density  resulted in a bcfe decrease in questar e p s proved reserves and a bcfe increase in cost of service proved reserves  representing approximately one percent and three percent of reported proved reserves  respectively  as of december  
revisions associated with pinedale increased density drilling added bcfe to questar e p s estimated proved reserves at december   and bcfe of additional cost of service proved reserves 
see note for more information on the company s estimated proved reserves 
successful efforts accounting for gas and oil operations the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for gas and oil property acquisitions  exploration  development and production activities 
under this method  the acquisition costs of proved and unproved properties  successful exploratory wells and development wells are capitalized 
other exploration costs  including geological and geophysical costs  the delay rental and administrative costs associated with unproved property and unsuccessful exploratory well costs  are expensed 
costs to operate and maintain wells and field equipment are expensed as incurred 
the capitalized costs of unproved properties are generally combined and amortized over the expected holding period for such properties 
individually significant unproved properties are periodically reviewed for impairment 
capitalized costs of unproved properties are reclassified as proved property when related proved reserves are determined or charged against the impairment allowance when abandoned 
capitalized proved property acquisition costs are amortized by field using the unit of production method based on proved reserves 
capitalized exploratory well and development costs are amortized similarly by field based on proved developed reserves 
the calculation takes into consideration estimated future equipment dismantlement  surface restoration and property abandonment costs  net of estimated equipment salvage values 
other property and equipment are generally depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives or the unit of production method for certain processing plants 
a gain or loss is generally recognized only when an entire field is sold or abandoned  or if the unit of production amortization rate would be significantly affected 
questar e p engages independent reservoir engineering consultants to prepare estimates of the proved gas and oil reserves 
reserve estimates are based on a complex and highly interpretive process that is subject to continuous revision as additional production and development drilling information becomes available 
questar form k long lived assets are assessed for impairment whenever changes in facts and circumstances indicate a possible significant deterioration in the future cash flows expected to be generated on a field by field basis 
impairment is indicated when a triggering event occurs and the sum of estimated undiscounted future net cash flows of the evaluated asset is less than the asset s carrying value 
the asset value is written down to estimated fair value  which is determined using discounted future net cash flows 
accounting for derivatives contracts the company uses derivative contracts  typically fixed price swaps  to hedge against a decline in the realized prices of its gas and oil production 
accounting rules for derivatives require marking these instruments to fair value at the balance sheet reporting date 
the change in fair value is reported either in net income or comprehensive income depending on the structure of the derivatives 
the company has structured virtually all energy derivative instruments as cash flow hedges as defined in sfas as amended 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced 
when a derivative is terminated before its contract expires  the associated gain or loss is recognized in income over the life of the previously hedged production 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the period that services are provided or products are delivered 
questar e p uses the sales method of accounting whereby revenue is recognized for all gas  oil and ngl sold to purchasers 
revenues include estimates for the two most recent months using published commodity index prices and volumes supplied by field operators 
a liability is recorded to the extent that questar e p has an imbalance in excess of its share of remaining reserves in an underlying property 
energy trading presents revenues on a gross revenue basis 
energy trading does not engage in speculative hedging transactions  nor does it buy and sell energy contracts with the objective of generating profits on short term differences in prices 
questar gas estimates revenues on a calendar basis even though bills are sent to customers on a cycle basis throughout the month 
the company estimates unbilled revenues for the period from the date meters are read to the end of the month  using usage history and weather information 
approximately one half month of revenues is estimated in any period 
the gas costs and other variable costs are recorded on the same basis to ensure proper matching of revenues and expenses 
questar gas tariff provides for monthly adjustments to customer bills to approximate the impact of normal temperatures on nongas revenues 
questar gas estimates the weather normalization adjustment for the unbilled revenue each month 
the weather normalization adjustment is evaluated each month and reconciled on an annual basis in the summer to agree with the amount billed to customers 
in  the pscu approved a pilot program for a conservation enabling tariff effective january   to promote energy conservation 
under the cet  questar gas non gas revenues are decoupled from the volume of gas used by customers 
the tariff specifies a margin per customer for each month with differences to be deferred and recovered from customers or refunded to customers through periodic rate adjustments 
these adjustments will be limited to one percent of total revenues for the first year 
rate regulation regulatory agencies establish rates for the storage  transportation  distribution and sale of natural gas 
the regulatory agencies also regulate  among other things  the extension and enlargement or abandonment of jurisdictional natural gas facilities 
regulation is intended to permit the recovery  through rates  of the cost of service  including a return on investment 
questar gas and questar pipeline follow sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  that requires the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities by companies subject to cost based regulation 
the ferc  pscu and pscw have accepted the recording of regulatory assets and liabilities 
employee benefit plans the company has pension and postretirement benefit plans covering a majority of its employees 
the calculation of the company s expense and liability associated with its benefit plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical 
changes in these assumptions can result in different expenses and liabilities and actual experience can differ from these assumptions 
independent consultants hired by the company use actuarial models to calculate estimates of pension and postretirement benefits expense 
the models use key factors such as mortality estimations  liability discount rates  long term rates of return on investments  rates of compensation increases  amortized gain or loss from investments and medical cost trend rates 
management makes assumptions based on market indicators and advice from consultants 
the company believes that the liability discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on benefit plan assets are critical assumptions 
questar form k the assumed liability discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefit obligations could effectively be settled 
management considers the rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments and compares those results with a bond defeasance technique 
the company discounted its future pension liabilities using rates of as of december   and as of december  a decrease in the discount rate increased the company s qualified pension annual expense by million 
in september  the fasb issued sfas employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the new accounting standard required disclosure of the over or under funded status of defined benefit plans on the balance sheet effective with annual reports on form k for the year ending december  the over or under funded defined benefit pension position was measured by the difference in the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation 
the projected benefit obligation includes an estimate of future salary changes 
the over or under funded position of other postretirement benefits was measured by the difference in the fair value of plan assets and the accumulated benefit obligation 
the expected long term rate of return on benefit plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the benefit plan liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year giving consideration to the benefit plan s investment mix and the historical and forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company was as of january  and as of january  benefit plan expense typically increases as the expected long term rate of return on plan assets decreases 
a decrease in the expected long term rate of return causes a million increase in pension expense

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk questar s primary market risk exposures arise from commodity price changes for natural gas  oil and ngl  and volatility in interest rates 
energy trading has long term contracts for pipeline capacity and is obligated for transportation services with no guarantee that it will be able to recover the full cost of these transportation commitments 
commodity price risk management market resources bears the risk associated with commodity price changes and uses gas and oil price derivative arrangements in the normal course of business to limit the risk of adverse price movements 
however these same arrangements typically limit future gains from favorable price movements 
derivative contracts are used for a significant share of questar e p owned gas and oil production  a portion of energy trading gas and oil marketing transactions and some of gas management s ngl 
market resources has established policies and procedures for managing commodity price risks through the use of derivatives 
natural gas and oil price hedging support market resources rate of return and cash flow targets and protects earnings from downward movements in commodity prices 
the volume of hedged production and the mix of derivative instruments are regularly evaluated and adjusted by management in response to changing market conditions and reviewed periodically by the finance and audit committee of the company s board of directors 
market resources may hedge up to of forecast production from proved reserves when prices meet earnings and cash flow objectives 
market resources does not enter into derivative arrangements for speculative purposes and does not hedge undeveloped reserves or questar e p equity ngl 
market resources uses fixed price swaps to manage natural gas  oil and ngl price risk 
a fixed price swap is a derivative instrument that exchanges or swaps the floating or daily price of a specified volume of natural gas  oil or ngl  over a specified period  for a fixed price for the specified volume over the same period 
in the normal course of business  the company sells its equity natural gas  oil and ngl production to third parties at first of the month or daily floating prices related to indices reported in industry publications 
to reduce exposure to highly volatile daily and monthly commodity prices  the company uses a derivative instrument that exchanges or swaps the floating or daily price of the commodity for a fixed price for the specified period typically for periods of three months or longer 
the company enters into these transactions with banks and industry counterparties with investment grade credit ratin gs 
swap agreements do not require the physical transfer of gas between the parties at settlement 
swap transactions are settled monthly  in cash  with one party paying the other for the net difference in prices  multiplied by the relevant volume  for the settlement period 
questar form k generally derivative instruments are matched to equity gas and oil production  thus qualifying as cash flow hedges under the accounting provisions of sfas as amended and interpreted 
changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges are recorded on the balance sheet and in other comprehensive income or loss until the underlying gas or oil is produced 
gas hedges are typically structured as fixed price swaps into regional pipelines  locking in basis and hedge effectiveness 
the ineffective portion of cash flow hedges is immediately recognized in the determination of net income 
market resources also entered into natural gas basis only swaps in to manage the risk of a widening of basis differentials in the rocky mountains 
these contracts are marked to market with any change in the valuation recognized in the determination of net income 
market resources enters into commodity price derivative arrangements with several banks and energy trading firms with a variety of credit requirements 
some contracts do not require collateral deposits  while others allow some amount of credit before market resources is required to deposit collateral for out of the money contracts 
the amount of credit available may vary depending on the credit rating assigned to market resources debt 
in addition  to the counterparty arrangements  market resources has a million long term revolving credit facility with banks with no borrowings outstanding at december  a summary of market resources derivative positions for equity production as of december   is shown below 
currently fixed price and basis only swaps are with creditworthy counterparties 
fixed price swaps allow market resources to realize a known price for a specific volume of production delivered into a regional sales point 
the fixed price swap price is then reduced by gathering costs and adjusted for product quality to determine the net to the well price

market resources five largest customers are sempra energy trading corp  bp energy company  oneok energy services company lp  enterprise products operating and nevada power company 
sales to these companies accounted for of market resources revenues before elimination of intercompany transactions in  and their accounts were current at december  questar pipeline requests credit support  such as letters of credit and cash deposits  from those companies that pose unfavorable credit risks 
all companies posing such concerns were current on their accounts at december  questar pipeline s largest customers include questar gas  pacificorp  kerr mcgee  eog resources and chevron texaco 
questar gas requires deposits from customers that pose unfavorable credit risks 
no single customer accounted for a significant portion of revenue in interest rate risk the fair value of fixed rate debt is subject to change as interest rates fluctuate 
the company had  million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of  million at december  a year earlier the company had million of fixed rate long term debt with a fair value of  million 
if interest rates would have declined  fair value would increase to  million in and  million in the fair value calculations do not represent the cost to retire the debt securities
