item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with selected consolidated financial data and td group s consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
references to transdigm  the company  we  us  our and similar references refer to td group  transdigm inc and transdigm inc 
s subsidiaries  unless the context otherwise indicates 
the following discussion may contain predictions  estimates and other forward looking statements that involve a number of risks and uncertainties  including those discussed under the heading entitled risk factors included elsewhere in this report 
these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we believe we are a leading global designer  producer and supplier of highly engineered aircraft components for use on nearly all commercial and military aircraft in service today 
our business is well diversified due to the broad range of products we offer to our customers 
some of our more significant product offerings  substantially all of which are ultimately provided to end users in the aerospace industry  include ignition systems and components  mechanical electro mechanical actuators and controls  gear pumps  engineered connectors  specialized valving  power conditioning devices  engineered latches and cockpit security devices  specialized ac dc electric motors  lavatory hardware and components  hold open rods and locking devices  aircraft audio systems  nicad batteries chargers  and specialized fluorescent lighting and cockpit displays 
each of these product offerings consists of many individual products that are typically customized to meet the needs of a particular aircraft platform or customer 
for fiscal year  we generated net sales of million and net income of million 
in addition  for fiscal year  our ebitda was million  or of net sales  our ebitda as defined was million  or of net sales  and our capital expenditures were million  or of net sales 
see ebitda and ebitda as defined below for certain information regarding ebitda and ebitda as defined  including a reconciliation of ebitda and ebitda as defined to net income 
we estimate that over of our net sales for fiscal year were generated by proprietary products for which we own the design 
these products are generally approved and certified by airframe manufacturers who often certify only one manufacturer s component design for a specific application on an aircraft  government agencies and or the faa and similar entities or agencies 
in addition  for fiscal year  we estimate that we generated approximately of our net sales from products for which we are the sole source provider 
most of our products generate significant aftermarket revenue 
once our parts are designed into and sold as original equipment on an aircraft  we generate net sales from recurring aftermarket consumption over the life of that aircraft 
this installed base and our sole source provider position generate a long term stream of aftermarket revenues over the estimated year life of an individual aircraft 
we estimate that approximately of our net sales in fiscal year were generated from aftermarket sales  the vast majority of which come from the commercial and military aftermarkets 
these aftermarket revenues have historically produced a higher gross margin and been more stable than sales to oems 
in fiscal year  our top two customers accounted for approximately of our net sales  and during this same period our top ten customers accounted for approximately of our net sales 
however  our components are ultimately used on a large  diverse installed base of aircraft and  therefore  we are not overly dependent on any single airframe produced by any of our customers or other ultimate end users of our products 
in the commercial aerospace sector  which generated approximately of our net sales for fiscal year  we sell to distributors of aftermarket components  as well as directly to commercial airlines  aircraft maintenance facilities  systems suppliers  and aircraft and engine oems 
in addition  for fiscal year  approximately of our net sales were attributable to the defense aerospace sector 
net sales to the defense sector are generated 
table of contents primarily through sales to the united states and foreign militaries  brokers  distributors and defense oems 
the remaining portion of our net sales in fiscal year  or approximately of our net sales during this period  were derived from industries with similar niche engineered product characteristics such as the mining and power generation industries 
public offerings on may   certain of td group s stockholders  including certain members of our management  sold an aggregate of million shares of td group s common stock in an underwritten public offering at a public offering price of per share 
as a result of this offering  td group is no longer a controlled company for the purposes of the nyse listing requirements 
td group did not sell any shares in the offering and did not receive any proceeds from the offering 
on march   certain stockholders of td group and certain members of our management sold an aggregate of approximately million shares of td group s common stock in the initial public offering at a price of per share 
td group did not offer any shares of its common stock for sale in the initial public offering and td group did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of such shares by the selling stockholders 
as a result of the initial public offering  td group s common stock is publicly traded on the new york stock exchange under the ticker symbol tdg 
certain acquisitions bruce acquisition on august   pursuant to an asset purchase agreement among transdigm inc  bruce industries and the shareholders of bruce industries  bruce aerospace  inc  a newly formed wholly owned subsidiary of transdigm inc  acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of bruce industries for approximately million in cash

the acquired business was consolidated into skurka s existing aerospace motor business in camarillo  california during fiscal 
table of contents ebitda and ebitda as defined the following table sets forth the calculation of ebitda and ebitda as defined 
fiscal years ended september  in millions net income adjustments depreciation and amortization expense interest expense  net income tax provision ebitda adjustments acquisition related costs non cash compensation and deferred compensation costs one time special bonus refinancing costs public offering costs other ebitda as defined ebitda represents earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
represents costs incurred to integrate acquired businesses into td group s operations  purchase accounting adjustments to inventory that were charged to cost of sales when the inventory was sold and acquisition earnout costs 
the amount recognized for the earnout payments to howard skurka are pursuant to the terms of the retention agreement entered into with him in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of skurka in december represents the expenses recognized by the company under our stock option and deferred compensation plans 
the amount reflected above for fiscal includes i a reversal of previously recorded amounts charged to expense of million resulting from the termination of two of our deferred compensation plans during fiscal  and ii expense recognized by us under a new deferred compensation plan adopted by us in december represents the aggregate amount of one time special bonuses paid on november  to certain members of management 
represents costs associated with refinancing the debt structure of td group in fiscal  including the premium of million paid to redeem our senior subordinated notes  the write off of debt issue costs of million  and other expenses of million 
represents costs and expenses incurred by td group related to the initial public offering in march or the secondary offering in may represents the write down of certain property to its fair value that has been reclassified as held for sale in fiscal ebitda as defined represents ebitda plus  as applicable for the relevant period  inventory purchase accounting adjustments  acquisition integration costs  non cash compensation and deferred compensation costs  one time special bonus payments made to members of our management and certain acquisition earnout costs  and expenses or charges incurred by us in connection with equity offerings  permitted investments  acquisitions  dispositions  recapitalizations or permitted debt transactions  including all of the expenses or charges relating to the refinancing in june our management uses ebitda as defined to review and assess our operating performance and management team in connection with our employee incentive programs and the preparation of our annual budget and our financial projections 
in addition  the revolving credit facility under the senior secured credit facility requires compliance  on a pro forma basis  with a first lien leverage ratio  which is measured based on our consolidated ebitda as defined therein 

table of contents the senior secured credit facility defines consolidated ebitda in a manner equal to how we defined ebitda as defined for the fiscal year ended september  this financial covenant is a material term of the senior secured credit facility as failure to comply with such financial covenant could result in an event of default in respect of the revolving credit facility under the senior secured credit facility and  in turn  such an event of default could result in an event of default under the indenture 
in addition  our former senior secured credit facility required compliance  on a pro forma basis  with a leverage ratio  a fixed charge coverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio  all of which were measured based on our consolidated ebitda as defined therein 
the former senior secured credit facility defined consolidated ebitda in a manner equal to how we defined ebitda as defined for the periods presented prior to fiscal  and such historical definition was substantially similar to the definition of consolidated ebitda under the senior secured credit facility  except that for purposes of computing consolidated ebitda under the senior secured credit facility  we are permitted to add back to net income  any and all expenses or charges incurred by us in connection with equity offerings  permitted investments  acquisitions  dispositions  recapitalizations or permitted debt transactions  including all of the expenses or charges related to the refinancing in june although we use ebitda and ebitda as defined as measures to assess the performance of our business and for the other purposes set forth above  the use of ebitda and ebitda as defined as an analytical tool has limitations  and you should not consider either of them in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results of operations as reported in accordance with gaap 
some of these limitations are neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined reflects the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest payments  on our indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined reflects any cash requirements for such replacements  the omission of the substantial amortization expense associated with our intangible assets further limits the usefulness of ebitda and ebitda as defined  neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined includes the payment of taxes  which is a necessary element of our operations  and ebitda as defined excludes the cash expense we have incurred to integrate acquired businesses into our operations  which is a necessary element of certain of our acquisitions 
because of these limitations  ebitda and ebitda as defined should not be considered as measures of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
management compensates for these limitations by not viewing ebitda or ebitda as defined in isolation  and specifically by using other gaap measures  such as net income  net sales and operating profit  to measure our operating performance 
neither ebitda nor ebitda as defined is a measurement of financial performance under gaap and neither should be considered as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operations determined in accordance with gaap  and our calculation of ebitda and ebitda as defined may not be comparable to the calculation of similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
trend information the commercial aerospace industry is impacted by the health of the global economy and geo political events around the world 
the commercial aerospace industry suffered after the events of september  and the subsequent downturn in the global economy  the sars epidemic and  more recently  from rising fuel prices and the conflicts in the middle east 
recently  the industry has shown strength with increases in rpms  as well as oem production and backlog 
rising fuel prices  conflicts in the middle east  and the risk of additional terrorist activity have tempered the recovery somewhat 

table of contents our presence in both the commercial transport and military sectors of the aerospace industry may mitigate the impact on our business of any specific industry risk 
we service a diversified customer base in the commercial and military aerospace industry  and we provide components to a diverse installed base of aircraft  which mitigates our exposure to any individual airframe platform 
at times  declines in sales in any one sector have been offset by increased sales in another 
for example  the commercial transport sector that we serve was adversely affected by the events of september   but the downturn in that market was partially offset by an increase in military aircraft spending that resulted from the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism 
there is industry consensus that conditions in the commercial transport market sector has improved recently 
we are experiencing increased activity in the large commercial oem sector aircraft with or more seats driven by order announcements by the boeing company and airbus sas the business jet oem sector has also shown increased activity driven by the overall recovery of the economy 
we expect this level of activity to continue in the near future 
rpms have surpassed the pre september  level  and absent any disruptive events  we are hopeful our aftermarket business will continue to follow this trend 
in recent years  defense spending has reached historic highs  due in part to the military engagements in afghanistan and iraq and the war on terrorism 
the military business showed some modest gains from the prior year 
our military business fluctuates from year to year  and is dependent  to a degree  on government budget constraints  the timing of orders and the extent of global conflicts 
we anticipate that military related sales of our types of products will experience modest growth over the current high levels 
the aerospace industry is cyclical and fragmented 
there are many short term factors including inventory corrections  unannounced changes in order patterns and mergers and acquisitions that can cause short term disruptions in our quarterly shipment patterns as compared to previous quarters and the same periods in prior years 
to normalize for short term fluctuations  we tend to look at our performance over several quarters or years of activity rather than discreet short term periods 
as such  it can be difficult to determine longer term trends in our business based on quarterly comparisons 
there are also fluctuations in oem and aftermarket ordering and delivery requests from quarter to quarter 
due to the differences between the profitability of our products sold to oem and aftermarket customers  variation in product mix can cause short term swings in gross margins 
again  in many instances these are timing events between quarters and must be balanced with macro aerospace industry indicators 
we believe that the boeing company and airbus sas are in a period of increased production and we think we are well positioned on the new aircraft platforms recently announced 
having significant content on these new aircraft platforms could negatively impact our margin over the near term  given that oem revenues tend to produce lower gross margins than aftermarket revenues  but should positively impact our business in future years as replacement aftermarket parts will be required to service these new aircrafts 
although the aerospace industry is in a cycle of increased production  our business would be adversely affected by significant changes in the us or global economy 
historically  aircraft travel  as measured by rpms  generally correlates to economic conditions and a reduction in aircraft travel would result in a decrease in the need for aftermarket parts  which in turn would adversely affect our business 

table of contents government pricing review certain parts sold by five of our divisions and subsidiaries to the department of defense dod through various buying agencies of the defense logistics agency have been the subject of a pricing review by the dod office of inspector general 
the pricing review examined whether the various buying offices within the defense logistics agency had negotiated fair and reasonable prices for certain sole source spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries during fiscal years through on february   we received a copy of the inspector general s final report dated february   and on april   a redacted version of such report was made publicly available 
the report recommends  among other things  that the defense logistics agency contracting officers reevaluate their procedures for determining the reasonableness of pricing for sole source spare parts purchased from those divisions and subsidiaries and seek to develop strategic supplier alliances with those divisions and subsidiaries 
we believe that the pricing review is part of a continuing effort by the inspector general to monitor and evaluate prices paid to defense contractors for sole source spare parts 
the report is consistent with reports issued with respect to sole source spare parts supplied by other companies  and  like those other reports  it advocates the negotiation of strategic supplier alliances incorporating prices for parts based on cost  rather than based on prices of comparable commercial parts or other methods 
we believe that our pricing of spare parts comports with the regulations applicable to contracts with agencies of the federal government 
nonetheless  the report recommends that the defense logistics agency request that the applicable divisions and subsidiaries of transdigm inc voluntarily refund  in the aggregate  approximately million for allegedly overpriced parts and negotiate strategic supplier alliances incorporating cost based prices for future defense logistics agency purchases of sole source spare parts 
the company s position has been  and continues to be  that our pricing has been fair and reasonable and that there is no legal basis for the amount suggested as a refund by the inspector general in its report 
in response to the report  we offered reasons why we disagree with the inspector general s overall analysis 
the defense logistics agency requested additional information from the company and the company s position on the voluntary refund 
the company responded to such request 
in february  the defense logistics agency made a request to initiate discussions regarding future pricing and develop an acquisition strategy that will mutually strengthen transdigm s and the defense logistics agency s business relationship 
the parties have discussed and are considering future purchasing approaches but negotiations with the defense logistics agency regarding strategic supplier alliances or any specific approach have not yet commenced  but will likely occur at a later date 
as a result of those negotiations  it is possible that the divisions and subsidiaries subject to the pricing review will enter into strategic supplier alliances with the defense logistics agency 
it is likely in connection with any strategic supplier alliance  the defense logistics agency will seek prices for parts based on cost or may seek volume discounts or other favorable pricing and or the applicable division or subsidiary may agree to cost or pricing justification or appropriate discounts 
it is also possible that the dod may seek alternative sources of supply for such parts 
the entry into strategic supplier alliances or a decision by the dod to pursue alternative sources of supply for our sole source parts could reduce the amount of revenue we derive from  and the profitability of certain of our supply arrangements with  certain agencies and buying organizations of the us government 
while management believes that the entry into strategic supplier alliances with the defense logistics agency will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  liquidity or capital resources  there is no means to determine the outcome of any future negotiations or discussions at this time 

table of contents critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which often requires the judgment of management in the selection and application of certain accounting principles and methods 
management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
however  investors are cautioned that the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies upon which our financial status depends 
these critical policies were determined by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition and related allowances substantially all of our revenues are recognized based upon shipment of products to the customer  at which time title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
substantially all sales are made pursuant to firm  fixed price purchase orders received from customers 
provisions for returns  uncollectible accounts and the cost of repairs under contract warranty provisions are provided for in the same period as the related revenues are recorded and are principally based on historical results modified  as appropriate  by the most current information available 
we have a history of making reasonably dependable estimates of such allowances  however  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  it is possible that actual results may vary from the estimates and the differences could be material 
management estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of the accounts receivable and customer creditworthiness 
the allowance also incorporates a provision for the estimated impact of disputes with customers 
management s estimate of the allowance amounts that are necessary includes amounts for specifically identified losses and a general amount for estimated losses based on historical information 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to significant levels of judgment and estimation by management 
if circumstances change or economic conditions deteriorate  management may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company provides limited warranties in connection with the sale of its products 
the warranty period for products sold varies throughout the company s operations  ranging from days to five years 
in addition  certain contracts with distributors contain right of return provisions 
the company accrues for estimated returns and warranty claims based on knowledge of product performance issues and excess inventories provided by its customers and industry sources 
the company also provides a general amount based on historical results 
historically  actual product returns and warranty claims have not differed materially from the estimates originally established 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost of inventories is determined by the average cost and the first in  first out fifo methods 
because the company sells products that are installed on airframes that can be in service for or more years  it must keep a supply of such products on hand while the airframes are in use 
provision for potentially obsolete or slow moving inventory is made based on our analysis of inventory levels  past usage and future sales forecasts 
although management believes that the company s estimates of obsolete and slow moving inventory are reasonable  actual results may differ materially from the estimates and additional provisions may be required in the future 
in addition  in accordance with industry practice  all inventories are classified as current assets as all inventories are available and necessary to support current sales  even though a portion of the inventories may not be sold within one year 
intangible assets mergers and acquisitions have resulted in significant amounts of identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
intangible assets other than goodwill are recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed or exchanged  regardless of the company s intent to do so 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets are recorded at fair value on the date of acquisition and  under financial accounting standards board statement no 
 
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  are reviewed at least annually for impairment based on cash flow projections and fair value estimates 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows is based on the company s strategic plans and long range planning forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the plans are based on industry and company specific data 
the profit margin assumptions included in the plans are projected based on the current cost structure and anticipated cost changes 
if different assumptions were used in these plans  the related undiscounted cash flows used in measuring impairment could be different and the recognition of an impairment loss might be required 
intangible assets  such as goodwill  trademarks and trade names that have an indefinite useful life are not amortized 
all other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
stock options and deferred compensation plans the company accounts for the cost of its stock options under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement of compensation expense under the stock option plan to be based on the fair value of the awards under the plan on the grant dates and amortizes the expense over the options vesting periods 
in addition  the company accounts for the cost of the deferred compensation plans of td group in accordance with opinion no 
of the accounting principles board  which requires the cost of deferred compensation arrangements to be accrued over the service period of the related employees in a systematic and rational manner 
purchase accounting the warburg merger and our other acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method 
accordingly  fair value adjustments to the company s assets and liabilities are recognized and the results of operations of the acquired business are included in its consolidated financial statements from the effective date of the merger or acquisition 
we generally use third party appraisals to assist us in determining the fair value adjustments 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data of the company  including presentation of the amounts as a percentage of net sales  amounts in thousands fiscal years ended of sales of sales of sales net sales cost of sales selling and administrative amortization of intangibles refinancing costs income from operations interest expense  net income tax provision net income fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year sales growth excluding acquisitions was million and represented a increase over the prior year 
the organic sales growth was primarily due to i an increase of million of commercial aftermarket sales resulting from the strong underlying demand in the worldwide commercial aerospace market and the strength of our proprietary products and market position  ii an increase of million of commercial oem sales primarily resulting from the increase in the business jet market  and iii an increase of million of military sales 
the remaining million increase resulted from the acquisitions of the businesses of cda  ati  and bruce industries in fiscal and businesses of electra motion and sweeney in fiscal 
table of contents cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from from fiscal year cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased approximately percentage points to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the absolute dollar increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increased volume associated with the higher net sales of million discussed above  a million charge  or of net sales  that resulted from inventory purchase price accounting charges pertaining to the acquisitions of the businesses of cda  ati and bruce industries and an increase in acquisition integration costs of approximately million relating to recent acquisitions 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due to favorable product mix on the increase in commercial aftermarket sales  productivity improvements and to a lesser extent  favorable fixed cost leverage on greater volume 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the prior year period included non recurring costs of million for a one time special bonus and million of costs associated with the initial public offering 
these prior year costs were partially offset by a million reversal of charges resulting from the termination of two deferred compensation plans in fiscal the net reduction of prior year non operating activity of approximately million  or of prior year net sales  was partially offset by an increase in selling and administrative costs associated with higher sales volume discussed above  higher research and development costs of million  or of net sales  relating to the boeing and other new programs and million  or of net sales  of costs associated with the secondary offering 
selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales decreased to for fiscal year from for the comparable period last year  primarily due to the factors described above 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles increased by million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the additional identifiable intangible assets recognized in connection with the acquisitions of the businesses of cda  ati and bruce industries  of which million related to order backlog amortization that is typically amortized over months 
refinancing costs 
refinancing costs represented a one time charge that was recorded in june as a result of the refinancing of transdigm s entire debt structure 
the charge of million consisted of the premium of million paid to redeem our senior subordinated notes and the write off of million of debt issue costs associated with our former senior credit facility  our senior subordinated notes and the td group loan facility and other expenses of million 
income from operations 
operating income increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to higher sales  the refinancing costs of million recorded in fiscal  and other factors described above 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the net increase was primarily the result of an increase of our outstanding borrowings of approximately million related to the acquisition of ati in february  partially offset by lower interest rates from the refinancing of our debt structure during june the company s weighted average level of outstanding borrowings increased to approximately billion during fiscal from approximately million during fiscal  while the average interest rate decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below 
income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was approximately for fiscal year compared to for fiscal year the lower effective tax rate was primarily due to lower state and local taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes and a decrease in nondeductible public offering expenses 
these reductions were partially offset by an income tax benefit of million  or of the income before income taxes  recorded in fiscal resulting from the adoption of a change in texas tax law enacted in may 
table of contents net income 
net income increased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of the refinancing in fiscal and other factors referred to above 
fiscal year ended september  compared with fiscal year ended september  net sales 
net sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year sales growth excluding acquisitions was million and represented a increase over the prior year 
the organic sales growth was primarily due to i an increase of million of commercial aftermarket sales resulting from the continuing recovery in the commercial aerospace market and the strength of our proprietary products and market position  as well as new business initiatives  and ii an increase of million of commercial oem sales primarily resulting from the increase in production rates for the boeing company and airbus sas and related oem system suppliers as well as the business jet market 
partially offsetting the increase in organic sales was a slight decrease in military sales 
the remaining million increase resulted from the acquisitions of the businesses of skurka  fluid regulators  and a motor product line in fiscal and the businesses of electra motion and sweeney in fiscal cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from from fiscal year cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased approximately percentage points to for fiscal year from for fiscal year the increase in cost of sales was primarily due to increase volume associated with the higher net sales of million discussed above  partially offset by a reduction in acquisition related costs of million  or of net sales 
the decrease in cost of sales as a percentage of sales was primarily due to productivity improvements and the reduction in acquisition related costs partially offset by negative product mix from higher oem sales 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased by million or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was due to i a one time special bonus of million  or of net sales  paid to certain members of management  ii the costs associated with higher net sales discussed above  and iii initial public offing costs of million  or of net sales 
these increases were partially offset by i reversal of previously recorded charges of million  or of net sales  resulting from the termination in fiscal of the rollover deferred compensation plan and management deferred compensation plan  and ii the decrease of million due to lower compensation expense recorded under the new management deferred compensation plan adopted in december selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to for fiscal year from for the comparable period last year  primarily due to the factors described above 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization of intangibles decreased by million to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to order backlog that was recorded in accounting for acquisitions made in fiscal that was subsequently fully amortized in fiscal refinancing costs 
refinancing costs represent a one time charge that was recorded in june as a result of the refinancing of transdigm s entire debt structure 
the charge of million consisted of the premium of million paid to redeem our senior subordinated notes and the write off of million of debt issue costs associated with our former senior credit facility  our senior subordinated notes and the td group loan facility and other expenses of million 
income from operations 
operating income decreased by million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to the refinancing costs of million  partially offset by other factors described above 

table of contents interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the net decrease was primarily the result of our refinancing of our debt structure during fiscal as a result of the refinancing  despite an increase in our average level of outstanding borrowings to approximately million during fiscal from million during fiscal  the average interest rate decreased to during fiscal from during fiscal see liquidity and capital resources below 
income taxes 
income tax expense as a percentage of income before income taxes was for fiscal year and was comparable to for fiscal year net income 
net income decreased million  or  to million for fiscal year compared to million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of the refinancing and other factors referred to above 
backlog as of september   the company estimated its sales order backlog at million compared to an estimated sales order backlog of million as of september  this increase in backlog of million is due in part to the acquisitions of the businesses of cda  ati and bruce industries discussed above totaling approximately million 
the balance of the increase in sales order backlog is due to increases in orders across existing product lines in both the oem and aftermarket segments 
the majority of the purchase orders outstanding as of september  are scheduled for delivery within the next twelve months 
purchase orders may be subject to cancellation by the customer prior to shipment 
the level of unfilled purchase orders at any given date during the year will be materially affected by the timing of the company s receipt of purchase orders and the speed with which those orders are filled 
accordingly  the company s backlog as of september  may not necessarily represent the actual amount of shipments or sales for any future period 
foreign operations we manufacture substantially all of our products in the united states  however  as a result of our ati acquisition  some of our products are manufactured in malaysia 
we sell our products in the united states  as well as in foreign countries 
substantially all of our foreign sales are transacted in us dollars and  therefore  we have no material exposure to fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar as a result of foreign sales 
in addition the amount of components or other raw materials or supplies that we purchase from foreign suppliers  including our malaysian manufacturing subsidiary  are not material  with substantially all such transactions being made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have no material exposure to currency fluctuations in the rate of exchange between foreign currencies and the us dollar arising from these transactions 
our direct sales to foreign customers were approximately million  million  and million for fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices

the company expects its capital expenditures in fiscal to be approximately million and such expenditures are projected to increase moderately thereafter 
the company intends to pursue acquisitions that present opportunities consistent with the company s business direction 
the company regularly engages in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and investments 
however  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to consummate an agreement with respect to any future acquisition 
the company s acquisition strategy may require substantial capital  and no assurance can be given that the company will be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all 
if the company incurs additional debt to finance acquisitions  total interest expense will increase 
if the company has excess cash  it may consider methods by which it can provide cash to its debt or equity holders through a dividend  prepayment of indebtedness  repurchase of stock  or other means 
such activities will depend on prevailing market conditions  the company s liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
in addition  the company may issue additional debt if prevailing market conditions are favorable to doing so 
the company s ability to make scheduled interest payments on  or to refinance  the company s indebtedness  or to fund non acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts  will depend on the company s ability to generate cash in the future

the company may need to refinance all or a portion of its indebtedness on or before maturity 
also  to the extent the company accelerates its growth plans  consummates acquisitions or has lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses  the company may also need to raise additional capital 
in particular  increased working capital needs occur whenever the company consummates acquisitions or experiences strong incremental demand
