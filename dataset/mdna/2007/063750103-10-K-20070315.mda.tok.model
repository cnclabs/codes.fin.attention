item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview bank mutual corporation which we sometimes refer to as we or the company is a federally registered unitary savings and loan bank holding company which holds all of the outstanding shares of bank mutual  a federal savings bank bank mutual or the bank 
the company is the successor to a federally chartered corporation of the same name in a transaction in which the company converted into a fully shareholder owned corporation 
all references to the company refer to bank mutual corporation both before and after that transaction 
comparisons of financial condition at december  and assets bank mutual corporation s total assets at december   were billion as compared to billion at december  total assets increased slightly in primarily as a result of growth in the loan portfolio and in other assets partially offset by a decrease in securities and cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million in primarily as a result of a decrease in interest earning deposits at december  the interest earning deposits decrease was the result of using the interest earning deposits to fund the loan portfolio growth  to repay borrowings or repurchase our stock 
investment securities available for sale decreased million during as a result of maturing investment securities and using the proceeds from those maturities to fund loan growth  repay borrowings or to repurchase our stock 
mortgage related securities available for sale decreased million in primarily as a result of using the repayments and prepayments from the mortgage related securities to fund loan growth  repay borrowings or stock repurchases 
the current portfolio has a weighted average yield of approximately at december  at december   we had million of private label collateralized mortgage obligations cmos in our investment portfolio 
our private label cmos have primarily fixed and adjustable rate one to four family mortgage loans as their underlying collateral 
private label cmos have more credit risk than government agency cmos and  therefore  have a higher risk of impairment 
if permanent impairment would occur  a related impairment would reduce earnings

the following table sets forth our mortgage  consumer and commercial loan originations and purchases during the year ended december  in thousands originations mortgage loans consumer loans commercial business loans total loans originated purchases mortgage loans total loans originated and purchased loan originations decreased million in as compared to loan originations in  primarily as a result of increasing interest rates which prompted consumers to reduce the refinancing of their existing loans and fewer home purchases 
mortgage loan originations decreased million or and consumer loans decreased million or in as a result of the reduced refinancing of existing loans and reduced home purchases in our market areas 
a majority of the consumer loan originations continued to be first and second mortgage loans 
in addition  as we previously disclosed  we discontinued the origination of auto loans through sfc  our owned subsidiary  in may we decreased our purchases of mortgage loans during as a result of the opportunity for higher yields on investments and other loan originations 
properties securing all of the purchased mortgage loans are located in wisconsin 

table of contents commercial business loan originations decreased  or in primarily as a result of rising interest rates and slower growth in the economy which resulted in decreased demand for commercial business loans 
we anticipate that we will continue our emphasis on commercial loans  investment real estate and consumer loan originations to aid our asset and liability management and to aid in our overall profitability  although with somewhat more risk than traditional mortgage products 
loans held for sale at december  as compared to december  increased million as a result of fixed rate mortgage loan originations and our policy to sell some of those  and year fixed rate mortgage loans 
in the second quarter of  we began to retain certain and year fixed interest rate mortgage loans because those loans had characteristics which historically have indicated that they will be outstanding for a relatively short period of time 
most of the other and year fixed interest rate mortgage loan originations that do not have these characteristics are sold in the secondary mortgage market 
loans receivable increased million in as a result of growth in the one to four family  multi family  and construction and development mortgage loan portfolios 
the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio increased million or primarily as a result of reduced fixed rate mortgage loan sales  reduced refinancing of existing loans  mortgage loan purchases from third parties and increased adjustable interest rate mortgage loan originations which are retained in the portfolio 
the multi family portfolio increased million or primarily as a result of increased multi family originations 
management continues to emphasize this portion of the loan portfolio 
specifically  an experienced commercial real estate loan manager was hired late in the second quarter of rate competition for commercial real estate loans remains strong and  at times  we have chosen not to match some of the rate offerings which resulted in increased payoffs 
construction and development mortgage loans increased million or primarily as a result of increased one to four family and multi family construction loan originations 
the commercial real estate portfolio decreased million or primarily as a result of decreased loan originations and increased repayments and prepayments 
interest rate competition for commercial real estate continues to be strong and at times  we have chosen not to match some of the interest rate offerings which resulted in increased payoffs 
the consumer loan portfolio decreased million or primarily as a result of reduced consumer loan originations and the discontinuance of automobile originations through sfc 
historically  consumer loan originations decrease as mortgage loan originations decrease since many of our consumer loans are second mortgage loans and most second mortgages are cross sold at the time of the first mortgage loan origination 
in addition in may of  we discontinued originating indirect automobile loans through our owned subsidiary  sfc 
this decision decreased our automobile loan originations and the outstanding automobile loan portfolio and was in response to more profitable loan or investment alternatives 
the commercial business loan portfolio decreased million or primarily as a result of increased prepayments 
the competition to acquire and retain large commercial loans has also been intense with some of our commercial customers receiving interest rate offerings that we chose not to match 
as a result  those loans were paid off or not originated 
management expects to continue to emphasize consumer  non residential mortgage loan  multi family loan  and commercial business loan originations  as we believe they will continue to add to the overall profitability and aid in the management of interest rate risk 
however  these loans can present higher credit risks than residential mortgage loans 
goodwill resulted from the acquisitions of first northern capital corp 
first northern in and first federal bancshares of eau claire first federal in under the financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is tested at least annually for impairment 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  it will be expensed in the period in which it became impaired 
no impairment of goodwill occurred in  or 
table of contents other intangible assets are composed of core deposit base intangibles which were also the result of the first northern and first federal acquisitions 
other intangible assets are amortized over their expected life and tested for impairment at least annually 
mortgage servicing rights are established on mortgage loans that we originate and sell 
see significant accounting policies and comparisons of operating results for years ended december  and noninterest income below for a further discussion of mortgage servicing rights 
other assets are comprised of the following at december  in thousands accrued interest mortgage related securities investment securities loans receivable total accrued interest foreclosed properties and repossessed assets premises and equipment federal home loan bank stock  at cost bank owned life insurance prepaid and other our foreclosed properties and repossessed assets increased to million and non performing loans increased to million at december  as compared to  and million at december   respectively 
the increase in non performing loans was primarily the result of two loans to the same borrower  totaling million  which became non performing in the fourth quarter of see item business asset quality 
we believe that we continue to have good asset quality  particularly in our residential portfolio  and the homes  boats  recreational vehicles and other items that have been repossessed  are small in dollar amount in comparison to the size of our loan portfolio 
premises and equipment increased million in primarily as a result of adding two new offices 
we anticipate that up to three new bank offices will be established in one effect of these new bank offices will be an increase to our premises and equipment depreciation expense 
federal home loan bank fhlb of chicago stock decreased million because we redeemed some of our shares 
fhlb of chicago stock is redeemed at par 
the fhlb of chicago requires that its members own fhlb of chicago stock as a condition for borrowing  but we were able to reduce our ownership because of reduced borrowings outstanding 
we also had the opportunity to reinvest those dollars into securities or loans which had a higher rate of return 
the fhlb of chicago generally pays dividends not to exceed of its adjusted core income  which is net income excluding gains or losses from non recurring events 
in  the fhlb of chicago stock paid a dividend that equaled approximately or million in the aggregate

bank owned life insurance boli is an asset that we use to partially offset the future cost of employee benefits 
boli is long term life insurance on the lives of certain current and past employees where the insurance policy benefits and ownership are retained by us 
we value boli at the amount which we could obtain if we cashed in the policies at the current time 
the cash value accumulation on boli is permanently tax deferred if the policy is held to the insured person s death and certain other conditions are met 
we purchased an additional million of boli in december of to help offset increased future employee benefit costs 

table of contents liabilities deposits increased million in primarily as a result of an increase in retail certificates of deposit accounts  offset by a reduction in jumbo certificates of deposit and core deposits 
at december   wholesale and jumbo cd deposits were million as compared to million at december  we utilize wholesale and jumbo deposits in lieu of retail deposits when they cost less  fit a specific maturity period or when deposits are needed very quickly 
our retail certificates of deposit increased million and our core deposits checking  savings and money market accounts decreased million as a result of the increased interest rates offered on the certificates of deposit 
our borrowings decreased million in  as a result of repaying borrowings from the increase in the deposit portfolio  and the decrease in our mortgage related securities portfolio 
at december   million of the total million of borrowings had a maturity of days we refinanced the borrowing to a longer maturity date on january th  and million of the total borrowings have a fixed interest rate but after an initial period of months to year could be called by the fhlb of chicago quarterly thereafter 
while we expect that we would be able to refinance these borrowings with the fhlb  we cannot provide any assurances that we could do so or as to the terms on which any such refinancing could be made 
shareholders equity shareholders equity decreased million in primarily as a result of the repurchase of shares  and dividends paid in offset by our net earnings 
we repurchased  shares in at an average price of per share 
our existing repurchase plan  at december   had approximately million shares authorized but not yet repurchased 
on february   we modified the existing stock repurchase plan to allow us to repurchase an additional million shares 
in  through february th  we have repurchased  shares  at an average price of per share 
at february   we had million shares remaining to repurchase in our existing stock repurchase plan 
we increased our quarterly cash dividend to per share for the first and second quarter of  and again increased our cash dividend to per share for the third and fourth quarter of the dividend payout ratio for was  and total dividends paid during the year were million 
in february  we further increased our quarterly dividend to per share 
total dollars paid in dividends will not increase proportionately as a result of our share repurchases 
accumulated other comprehensive income increased million in primarily as a result of increased fair market value on the mortgage related securities 
accumulated other comprehensive income reflects the difference between the net current value of securities available for sale and the book value of those securities  net of tax  and any unfunded supplemental non qualified benefit plan obligation  net of tax 
our shareholders equity to total assets ratio at december  was as compared to at december  
table of contents average balance sheet and yield rate analysis the following tables present  for the periods indicated  the total dollar amount of interest income from average interest earning assets  the resultant yields  and the interest expense on average interest bearing liabilities  expressed both in dollars and rates 
no tax equivalent adjustments were made since we do not have any tax exempt investments 
average balances are derived from average daily balances 
the yield on securities available for sale is included in investment securities and mortgage related securities and yields are calculated on the historical basis 
the yields and rates are established by dividing income or expense dollars by the average balance of the asset or liability

interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest margin is determined by dividing net interest income by total interest earning assets 

table of contents rate volume analysis the following table presents the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have affected our interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to changes attributable to changes in volume change in volume multiplied by prior rate  changes attributable to change in rate changes in rate multiplied by prior volume  and the net change

table of contents comparisons of operating results for years ended december  and general net income was million or diluted earnings per share for as compared to million or diluted earnings per share for the decrease in net income was primarily the result of decreased net interest margin which reflects the increased cost of borrowings and deposits 
this net interest margin decrease was partially offset by an increase in total interest income which resulted from the increased yield on the loan and investment portfolio 
net interest income net interest income for decreased million  or  to million as compared to million for net interest income decreased primarily as the result of a decreased net interest margin 
the net interest margin for was as compared to for the decrease in the net interest margin for was primarily the result of the rising cost of deposits  stock repurchases  and a flattening and inversion of the yield curve 
the flattened or inverted yield curve reduces our ability to price loan offerings and reprice existing loans and investments at interest rates that would allow us to increase the yield on the loan portfolio faster than the increase in the cost of funds  thus compressing the net interest margin 
stock repurchases reduce capital which is non interest bearing by means of either borrowing an interest bearing liability or a reduction in an interest earning asset  thereby compressing the net interest margin 
total interest income total interest income for increased million  or  to million as compared to million for the increase was primarily the result of the increased dollar amount of average loans and investments outstanding  and the increased average yield earned on the loan and investment portfolio in interest income on loans increased million  or  to million as compared to million for the increase was the result of increased average dollars outstanding in the portfolio and increased average yield earned on the loan portfolio 
the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio increased million  the construction and development loan portfolio increased million in  and the average yield on the total loan portfolio increased to in from in interest income on investment securities decreased  or  as a result of decreased average investment securities outstanding partially offset by an increase in the average yield earned on those investments 
interest income on mortgage related securities decreased million  or  in as a result of decreased average mortgage related securities outstanding  partially offset by an increase in the average yield on this portfolio 
the decrease in the average portfolio outstanding was primarily the result of using the cash flows from those securities to fund loan portfolio growth  repay borrowings or to repurchase our shares 
the increase in the average yield on the mortgage related securities was the result of purchasing new mortgage related securities at interest rates that were higher than the existing yield on the portfolio 
interest income on interest earning deposits which includes federal funds sold increased million to million in as a result of the increased dollar amount in federal funds and increased yield on those interest earning deposits 
at times throughout  we increased short term investments primarily in anticipation of paying off or reducing our borrowings or to fund loans 
total interest expense total interest expense increased million or to million for as compared to the increase was the result of growth in average deposits and increased average cost of deposits and borrowings 
average deposits increased million in the average cost of deposits and borrowings were in as compared to in interest expense on deposits increased million or to million for as compared to million for the average cost of deposits for increased to as compared to for the federal reserve federal open market committee fomc increased short term interest rates seventeen times 
table of contents since june or a total of through june  after which time there have been no further increases 
however during the same period  medium and long term interest rates stayed approximately the same causing short term interest rates to be higher than the medium and long term interest rates 
this is known as an inverted yield curve 
this inversion has caused our deposit costs to increase substantially since most of deposits are priced from the short term portion of the yield curve 
in addition  competition has been strong for deposits with many competitors offering a premium interest rate to acquire deposits 
this competition made us increase our offering deposit interest rates which increased our cost on those deposits 
interest expense on borrowings increased million or to million for as compared to million for the increase was the result of increased average cost of borrowings throughout partially offset by a decrease in average borrowings outstanding 
average borrowings decreased in primarily because we repaid borrowings at times when it was economically advantageous for us to repay borrowings rather than to invest in investment securities or to originate loans 
the average cost of borrowings increased in primarily as a result of increased market interest rates on new or refinanced borrowings 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased  in primarily as a result of increased non performing loans 
the total allowance for losses at december  was million  or of nonperforming loans and of nonperforming assets as compared to million  or of nonperforming loans and of nonperforming assets at december  the increase was primarily the result of the  loan loss provision in  reduced charge offs  and modest growth in the loan portfolio 
net charge offs for were  as compared to million in the total loan loss allowance to total loans was at december  as compared to at the end of future provisions for loan losses will continue to be based upon our assessment of the overall loan portfolio and the underlying collateral  trends in nonperforming loans  current economic conditions and other relevant factors in order to maintain the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels to provide for probable and estimatable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
the establishment of the amount of the loan loss allowance inherently involves judgments by management as to the adequacy of the allowance  which ultimately may or may not be correct 
higher rates of loan defaults than anticipated would likely result in a need to increase provisions in future years 
also  as multi family and commercial loan portfolios increase  additional provisions would likely be added to the loan loss allowances as those portfolios carry a higher risk of loss 
see also asset quality in item  which is incorporated by reference  for certain other factors that may affect our provisions for loan losses on a go forward basis 
noninterest income total noninterest income increased  or to million as compared to million for the increase was primarily the result of increased service charges on deposits partially offset by decreased gains on the sale of investments and loans 
service charges on deposits increased million in primarily as a result of increased pricing of deposit service charges partially offset by a decrease in the number of checking accounts and an increased customer utilization of on line banking and check cards 
on line banking and real time check card purchase authorizations have allowed customers to manage their accounts better and reduce their service charge fees 
brokerage and insurance commissions decreased slightly in primarily as a result of decreased customer securities sales 
loan fees and servicing revenue increased  in primarily as a result of decreased amortization of mortgage servicing rights 
amortization of mortgage servicing rights follows repayments or prepayments of the underlying loans so as prepayments decrease so will the amortization of mortgage servicing rights or vice versa 
there were no impairments to the mortgage servicing rights in mortgage servicing rights normally become impaired from increased prepayments on mortgage loans which reduces the anticipated servicing fee income over the life of the loan 
gains on the sale of investments decreased million in as a result of decreased sales of equity securities 

table of contents gains on the sales of loans decreased  in as a result of decreased fixed rate mortgage loan sales 
loan sales in were million as compared to million in other income increased  in primarily as the result of increased fees earned on check cards debit cards  income on bank owned life insurance which we purchased an additional million in december of  and miscellaneous other income 
noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased  or to million in primarily as a result of increased other expenses 
compensation expense decreased  in primarily as a result of the completion of vesting of grants under the stock incentive plan restricted stock in  and lack of annual bonus under the management incentive mip in also  in  we incurred expense due to the accelerated vesting of restricted stock and compensation related to a bank officer s disability and subsequent retirement  which did not recur in the management recognition plan expense in was million as compared to million in the mip plan s minimum threshold targets were not met in therefore  no mip amount was expensed 
in  the mip expense was  the accelerated vesting of restricted stock and compensation expense in was  partially offsetting this decrease was an increase in stock option expense  in accordance with sfas no 
r  of  an increase in health care costs  and an increase in funding of the retirement plan 
occupancy and equipment expense decreased slightly in primarily as a result of a decrease in our data processing expense and a decrease in our equipment depreciation 
these decreases were partially offset by the increased occupancy costs associated with adding two new offices in other expenses increased  or in primarily as a result of an increase in write offs of overdrafts on check cards  increased marketing expense and increased consulting expense 
in  we changed our overdraft policy on check cards which significantly improved our fees on overdrafts  however  it also increased the amount of write offs on these accounts 
the increase in write offs in was  marketing expense increased  in primarily as a result of increased competition for deposit and loans 
consulting expense increased approximately  primarily as a result of continuing costs associated with a loan and deposit pricing model and the payment of finders fees for newly hired investment real estate and commercial bankers 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was  as compared to an effective tax rate of in in  income tax expense was reduced by  primarily as a result of a refund of federal income taxes paid in prior years 
bank owned life insurance income is permanently tax deferred if the policy is held to the participant s death and other conditions are met 
therefore  the income earned on the life insurance is not included in taxable income for the calculation of tax expense 
like many wisconsin financial institutions  we have non wisconsin subsidiaries which hold and manage investment assets and loans  the income on which has not been subject to wisconsin tax 
the wisconsin department of revenue has instituted an audit program specifically aimed at out of state subsidiaries of wisconsin banks 
the department has asserted the position that some or all of the income of the out of state subsidiaries is taxable in wisconsin 
the department is conducting audits of many wisconsin banks  its audit of bank mutual  has not yet been concluded  is not being actively pursued  and the department has not asserted a claim against the bank or its subsidiaries 
the department sent letters in late july to wisconsin financial institutions whether or not they were undergoing an audit reporting on settlements relating to these issues involving  at that time  financial institutions and their out of state investment subsidiaries 
the letter provided a summary of available settlement parameters 
for prior periods they include restrictions on the types of subsidiary income excluded from wisconsin taxation  assessment of certain back taxes relating to a limited time period  limitations on net operating loss carry forwards and interest on past due taxes but no penalties 
for and going forward  the letter states similar provisions  including limits on subsidiaries assets which could be considered in determining income not subject to wisconsin taxation 
as outlined  the settlement would result in the rescission of prior department letter rulings  and purport to be binding going forward except for future legislation or change by mutual agreement 
however  the letter appears 
table of contents to implicitly accept the general proposition that some out of state investment subsidiary income is not subject to wisconsin taxes 
the department s positions may be challenged by one or more financial institutions in the state 
the company has previously engaged in discussions with the department and has asked the department to consider some specific factors which the company believes may distinguish it from many other institutions 
depending upon the terms and circumstances or the outcome of potential litigation  an adverse resolution of these matters could result in additional wisconsin tax obligations for prior periods and or higher wisconsin taxes going forward  with a substantial negative impact on the earnings of bank mutual corporation 
the company believes it has reported income and paid wisconsin taxes in accordance with applicable legal requirements  and the department s long standing interpretations thereof  and that the company would likely prevail against the department should it attempt to tax the income of our nevada subsidiaries in wisconsin 
however  we can provide no assurances of this result 
we also may incur further costs in the future to address these issues

the increase in the average portfolio outstanding was primarily the result of investing approximately million in mortgage related securities at the end of the decrease in the average yield on the mortgage related securities portfolio was primarily a result of the reinvestment yield on new mortgage related securities being at interest rates that were less than the existing yield on the portfolio 
interest income on interest earning deposits which includes federal funds sold increased  to  in as a result of the increased dollar amount in federal funds and increased yield on those interest earning deposits

table of contents interest expense on borrowings increased million or to million for as compared to million for the increase was the result of increased average borrowings outstanding throughout average borrowings increased in primarily as a result of a two year million borrowing in the fourth quarter of in the last quarter of  we began to repay borrowings as seasonal loan demand decreased and the lack of investment opportunities with reasonable earning potential 
the average cost of borrowings decreased in primarily as a result of reduced market interest rates which allowed new borrowings to be at reduced interest rates 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses decreased  in primarily as a result of a decrease in multi family  commercial real estate  consumer and commercial business loan portfolios  all which have a higher risk than the one to four family mortgage loan portfolio 
as a result of the reduced risk in the loan portfolio  this reduced risk allowed us to reduce our provision for loan losses 
when the riskier components of the loan portfolio increase we will need to increase our provision for loan losses the total allowance for losses at december  was million  or of nonperforming loans and of nonperforming assets as compared to million  or of non performing loans and of nonperforming assets at december  the decrease was primarily the result of a million charge off of a commercial business loan in the second quarter of the total loan loss allowance to total loans was at december  as compared to at the end of noninterest income total noninterest income increased million or to million as compared to million for the increase was primarily the result of increased gains on the sales of investments

on line banking and real time check card purchase authorizations have allowed customers to manage their accounts better and reduce their service charge fees 
brokerage and insurance commissions decreased  in primarily as a result of decreased annuity sales 
interest rates on annuities increased more slowly than interest rates on deposits  thereby reducing the consumer demand for annuity products and our focus of having annuities purchased with non bank mutual deposits 
loan fees and servicing revenue decreased  in primarily as a result of a large prepayment fee on a construction and development loan in there were no impairments to the mortgage servicing rights in mortgage servicing rights normally become impaired from increased prepayments on mortgage loans  which reduces the anticipated servicing fee income over the life of the loan 
gains on the sale of investments increased million in as a result of increased sales of equity securities 
gains on the sales of loans increased  in as a result of increased fixed rate mortgage loan sales 
loan sales in were as compared to million in in  we sold one half of our interest in approximately acres of owned real estate to an unrelated third party  the transaction resulted in a million gain 
we simultaneously established a limited liability company arrowood development with that third party  in which we maintain a interest  to develop the land 
the loss on the retirement of debt in was a restructuring of million of fhlb borrowing 
we did not incur any prepayment penalties on debt restructuring in other income increased  in primarily as the result of increased fees earned on check cards debit cards  income on bank owned life insurance  and miscellaneous other income taxes 

table of contents noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased  or to million in primarily as a result of increased compensation expenses 
compensation expense increased million in primarily as a result of increased cost of management recognition plan mrp expense  retirement expense  health care expense and reduced deferral of loan origination cost 
the mrp expense increased  in as a result of the issuance of  restricted shares in may pursuant to the stock incentive plan and the accelerated vesting of restricted stock related to a bank officer s disability and subsequent retirement 
the accelerated vesting of restricted stock and compensation expense resulted in an additional  expense in retirement expense increased approximately  in primarily as a result of the decreased investment interest rate used in the future value calculation on the assets in the retirement plan 
deferred loan origination cost this is an offset to expense decreased approximately  in as a result of reduced loan originations from our retail office network 
each loan that is originated by our retail office network has an incremental compensation and benefit cost deferral  and as loan originations decrease the incremental compensation and benefit cost deferral also decreases 
occupancy and equipment expense decreased  primarily as a result of a write off in of a portion of one of our existing offices which was replaced with a new office and reduced depreciation expense on equipment in a large number of desktop computers were purchased in and and became or are becoming fully depreciated 
partially offsetting these expenses are increases in office building depreciation and office equipment resulting from opening three new offices in we anticipate opening an additional three new offices in  which will increase our occupancy and equipment expense 
other expenses decreased  in as a result of a decrease in real estate owned expense and a decrease in numerous other expenses 
the decrease in real estate owned expenses is primarily a result of the reduced operating cost of one commercial loan that had defaulted 
income taxes the effective tax rate for was  as compared to an effective tax rate of in liquidity and capital resources the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations  loan purchases  deposit withdrawals  and operating expenses 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  scheduled amortization  and prepayments of loan principal and mortgage related securities  maturities and calls of investment securities  borrowings from the fhlb of chicago and funds provided by our operations 
historically  these sources of funds have been adequate to maintain liquidity  with more borrowing in periods in which their operations generate less cash 
in the event these sources of liquidity would become inadequate  bank mutual believes that it could access the wholesale deposit market  although there can be no assurances that wholesale deposits would be available if needed 
during  we began to pay off borrowings with some of the cash received from our securities portfolio and growth in the retail deposit portfolio 
loan repayments and maturing investment securities are a relatively predictable source of funds 
however  deposit flows  calls of investment securities and prepayments of loans and mortgage related securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
for example  during  loan prepayments decreased because of the rising interest rate environment  another very different interest rate environment could lead to a significantly different result 
these factors reduce the predictability of the timing of these sources of funds 
our primary investing activities were the purchase of mortgage related securities  making and purchasing additional loans for the loan portfolio  and to a lesser extent  the purchase of investment securities 
these activities were funded by principal payments on mortgage loans and mortgage related securities  calls and maturities on investment securities  borrowings  deposits  and funds provided by our operating activities

shareholders equity decreased by million of accumulated other comprehensive income  consisting primarily of net unrealized losses  net of taxes  on securities available for sale 
bank mutual corporation in repurchased  shares  for an aggregate of million under its stock repurchase programs 
thus far in fiscal  through february   we repurchased  shares of our common stock  for an aggregate of million 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million during to million at december  the company provided million from investing activities  primarily as a result of principal repayments on mortgage related securities partially offset by purchases of mortgage related securities  and an increase in the loan portfolio 
the cash from operating activities of million is primarily a result of our net income for the year  and non cash expenses  offset by a net increase in other assets 
cash used by financing activities of million resulted primarily from the repayments on long term borrowings and repurchases of our stock  offset by net proceeds of the borrowings and an increase in deposits 
contractual obligations  commitments  contingent liabilities  and off balance sheet arrangements the company has various financial obligations  including contractual obligations and commitments  that may require future cash payments 
the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date 
further discussion of the nature of each obligation is included in the referenced note to the consolidated financial statements

b contains million of borrowings that after an initial locked interest rate period of months to years  contain quarterly call features 
the company s operating lease obligations represent short and long term lease and rental payments for facilities  certain software and data processing and other equipment 
purchase obligations represent obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on the company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the purchase obligation amounts presented above primarily relate to certain contractual payments for services provided for information technology

impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying notes of bank mutual corporation have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation 
significant accounting policies there are a number of accounting policies that we established which require us to use our judgment 
some of the more significant policies are as follows establishing the amount of the allowance for loan losses requires the use of our judgment 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and is based on the size and current risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  an assessment of individual problem loans and actual loss experience  current economic events in specific industries and geographical areas  including unemployment levels  and other pertinent factors  including regulatory guidance and general economic conditions 
determination of the allowance is inherently subjective as it requires significant estimates  including the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
loan losses are charged off against the allowance  while recoveries of amounts previously charged off are credited to the allowance 
a provision for loan losses is charged to operations based on management s periodic evaluation of the factors previously mentioned  as well as other pertinent factors 
evaluations are conducted at least quarterly and more often if deemed necessary 
if we misjudge a major component and experience a loss  it will likely affect our earnings 
developments affecting loans can also cause the allowance to vary 
table of contents significantly between quarters 
we consistently challenge ourselves in the review of the risk components to identify any changes in trends and their cause 
another valuation that requires our judgment relates to mortgage servicing rights 
mortgage servicing rights are recorded as an asset when loans are sold with servicing rights retained 
the total cost of loans sold is bifurcated between the loan balance and the servicing asset based on their relative fair values 
the capitalized value of mortgage servicing rights is amortized in proportion to  and over the period of  estimated net future servicing revenue 
mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of the initial carrying value  adjusted for amortization  or estimated fair value 
the carrying values are periodically evaluated for impairment 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing rights are stratified into pools based on term and interest rate 
impairment represents the excess of the remaining capitalized cost of a stratified pool over its fair value  and is recorded through a valuation allowance 
the fair value of each servicing rights pool is calculated based on the present value of estimated future cash flows using a discount rate  given current market conditions 
estimates of fair value include assumptions about prepayment speeds  interest rates and other factors which are subject to change over time 
changes in these underlying assumptions could cause the fair value of mortgage servicing rights  and the related valuation allowance  if any  to change significantly in the future 
we also use our judgment in the valuation of other intangible assets core deposit base intangibles 
core deposit base intangible assets have been recorded for core deposits defined as checking  money market and savings deposits that have been acquired in acquisitions that were accounted for as purchase business combinations 
the core deposit base intangible assets have been recorded using the assumption that they provide a more favorable source of funding than more expensive wholesale borrowings 
an intangible asset has been recorded for the present value of the difference between the expected interest to be incurred on these deposits and interest expense that would be expected if these deposits were replaced by wholesale borrowings  over the expected lives of the core deposits 
we currently estimate the underlying core deposits have lives of seven to fifteen years 
if we find these deposits have a shorter life  we will have to write down the asset by expensing the amount that is impaired 
we review goodwill at least annually for impairment  which requires the use of our judgment 
goodwill has been recorded as a result of two acquisitions in which the purchase price exceeded the fair value of tangible net assets acquired 
if goodwill is determined to be impaired  it would be expensed in the period in which it became impaired 
the assessment of our tax assets and liabilities involves the use of estimates  assumptions  interpretations  and judgments concerning certain accounting pronouncements and federal and state tax codes 
there can be no assurance that future events  such as court decisions  regulatory actions or interpretations  or changes in positions of federal and state taxing authorities will not differ from management s current assessment 
the impact of these matters could be significant to the consolidated results of operations and reported earnings

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk management of interest rate risk the bank s ability to maintain net interest income depends upon earning a higher yield on assets than the rates we pay on deposits and borrowings 
fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact both our level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of all interest earning assets  other than those with a short term to maturity 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature during a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate sensitivity gap  provides an indication of the extent to which our interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
see gap analysis below 
due to the nature of our operations  we are not directly subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
instead  our real estate loan portfolio  concentrated in wisconsin  is subject to risks associated with the state and local economies 
we seek to coordinate asset and liability decisions so that  under changing interest rate scenarios  earnings will remain within an acceptable range 
the primary objectives of our interest rate management strategy are to maintain earnings and capital within self imposed parameters over a range of possible interest rate environments  coordinate interest rate risk policies and procedures with other elements of our business plan  all within the context of the current business environment and our regulatory capital and liquidity requirements  and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our board of directors 
to achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk  our asset liability committee meets periodically to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment and provides reports to the board of directors 
this committee is comprised of senior management 
historically  our lending activities have been concentrated in one to four family first and second mortgage loans 
our primary source of funds has been deposits and borrowings  consisting primarily of time deposits and borrowings which have substantially shorter terms to maturity than the loan portfolio 
we have employed certain strategies to manage the interest rate risk inherent in the asset liability mix  including emphasizing the origination of adjustable rate and certain year fixed rate mortgage loans for our portfolio  and selling certain   and year fixed rate mortgage loans  maintaining a significant level of investment securities and mortgage related securities with a weighted average life of less than eight years or with interest rates that reprice in less than five years  and managing deposits and borrowings to provide stable funding 
we believe that the frequent repricing of our adjustable rate mortgage loans  the cash flows from our year fixed rate real estate loans  the shorter duration of our consumer loans  and adjustable rate features and shorter durations of our investment securities  reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 

table of contents gap analysis 
repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that specific time period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the costs of its liabilities relative to the yields of its assets and thus a decrease in the institution s net interest income 
an institution with a positive gap position would be expected  absent the effect of other factors  to experience the opposite result 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income 
at december   based on the assumptions below  our interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year exceeded our interest earning assets maturing or repricing within the same period by million 
this represented a negative cumulative one year interest rate sensitivity gap of  and a ratio of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within one year to interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within one year of the following table presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the information presented in the following table is based on the following assumptions i investment securities based upon contractual maturities and if applicable  call dates 
ii mortgage related securities based upon an independent outside source for determining cash flows prepayment speeds 
iii loans based upon contractual maturities  repricing date  if applicable  scheduled repayments of principal and projected prepayments of principal based upon our historical experience or anticipated prepayments 
iv deposits based upon contractual maturities and our historical decay rates 

table of contents v borrowings based upon the earlier of call date or final maturity

for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
if interest rates change  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase 

table of contents present value of equity in addition to the gap analysis table  we also use a simulation model to monitor interest rate risk 
the model reports the present value of equity in different interest rate environments  assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the present value of equity is the difference between the present value of expected cash flows of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest rate sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability ie  fixed rate  adjustable rate  caps  floors relative to the current interest rate environment 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline  whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset  depending on its repricing characteristics  may not decline 
increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity 
conversely  increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity 
the following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at december  the present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments 
for purposes of this table  we have made assumptions such as prepayment rates and decay rates similar to those used for the gap analysis table 
present value of equity as percent of present value of equity present value of assets change in dollar dollar percent present value percent interest rates amount change change ratio change basis points dollars in thousands as in the case of the gap analysis table  the methods we used in the previous table have some inherent shortcomings 
this type of modeling requires that we make assumptions which may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
for example  we make assumptions regarding the acceleration rate of the prepayment speeds of higher yielding mortgage loans 
prepayments will accelerate in a falling rate environment and the reverse will occur in a rising rate environment 
we also assume that decay rates on core deposits will accelerate in a rising rate environment and the reverse in a falling rate environment 
the table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates  when in practice rate changes on certain products  such as savings deposits  may lag market changes 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and therefore cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the present value of the equity model may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our present value of equity
