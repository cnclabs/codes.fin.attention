overview we offer products and services to consumers and providers in the fertility industry 
we have developed a provider network comprised of twenty nine contracted fertility centers in major markets across the united states 
our provider products and services are designed to support fertility center growth and risk transfer through a captive insurance company 
our consumer products and services are comprised of pharmaceutical marketing services and the shared risk refund program  a form of financing services to patients 
twenty one affiliate fertility centers purchase discrete service packages provided by us and eight fertility centers have access to our entire portfolio of products and services under our comprehensive partner program 
all twenty nine centers have access to our consumer products and services 
our business strategy is to align our information  technology and financial strengths and investments for the benefit of both providers and consumers of fertility services 
the primary elements of this strategy include i expanding our network of affiliated fertility centers  ii entering into additional partner contracts  iii increasing revenues and profits at contracted partner centers  iv increasing the number and value of service packages purchased by members of our network  v increasing penetration of our shared risk refund treatment program throughout the network  and vi increasing sales of pharmaceutical products to fertility patients 
major events impacting financial condition and results of operations on january  we signed a partner agreement with the seattle  washington based seattle reproductive medicine  inc  ps  or srm  physician practice 
under the terms of this year agreement  our service fees are comprised of reimbursed costs of services  a tiered percentage of revenues  and an additional fixed percentage of srm s earnings 
we also committed up to million to fund the construction and equipping of a new state of the art facility to house the clinical practice and embryology laboratory for srm and its patients 
based on the terms of this transaction  we were paid a fixed service fee for approximately eleven months of until the new facility was fully operational in december upon becoming fully operational  our service fees reverted to the fee structure described above 
effective january  we signed a partner agreement to supply a complete range of business  marketing and facility services to the reproductive partners medical group  inc  or rpmg  a fertility practice comprised of six physicians in the southern california market 
under the terms of this year agreement  our service fees are comprised of reimbursed costs of services  a tiered percentage of revenues  and an additional fixed percentage of rpmg s earnings 
we also committed up to million to fund any necessary capital needs of the practice 
effective january   the company became a minority equity investor in the assisted reproductive technology insurance company  ltd  artic 
artic is incorporated as an off shore captive insurance company designed to offer malpractice insurance to physicians and related facilities within the integramed network 
integramed s equity investment of  represents a ownership stake  which is accounted for on the cost basis 
artic is owned and controlled by participating physician groups  who own the remaining equity interest 
to date  earnings on our equity investment have been immaterial  however integramed is paid a predetermined fee to provide certain administrative and risk management related services to artic 
through september   we marketed pharmaceutical products directly to patients throughout our network and we had contracted with ivpcare  inc 
to provide certain business services related to the distribution of and accounting for these sales 
effective october   this agreement was terminated and replaced by a new agreement between us and ivpcare  inc 
under the terms of the new agreement  we are no longer a direct distributor of pharmaceutical products to patients as this function is being performed directly by ivpcare 
our responsibilities are limited to marketing the products for which we will receive marketing fees 
this compensation will approximate our previous contribution from those pharmaceutical sales and services  and will be shown on a net rather than gross basis 
as a result  as of october   we no longer recorded pharmaceutical sales  the related cost of sales and other costs related to pharmaceutical distribution 
we had anticipated and have subsequently experienced significant decreases in revenues and cost of sales  however assuming the same volume of pharmaceutical products had been distributed contribution from operations and income before income taxes  as well as net income  would have been virtually unaffected from this contract change 
in december  we amended our existing credit agreement with bank of america 
the amended agreement is comprised of a renewal and increase in our three year revolving credit line to million  and a new million five year term loan  of which approximately million was used to retire the outstanding balance on our previous term loan 
we believe that these credit facilities will be sufficient to fund our current operational  capital investment and acquisition plans 
during october  we provided notification that our financial statements for and the first two quarters of could not be relied on  and were restated due to an accounting error 
the restatements did not result in any changes to net income or earnings per share for any period  but  as of march   had the effect of increasing intangible assets by  decreasing deferred tax assets by  and increasing deferred tax liabilities by  all non cash items 
all periods affected by this error have been restated throughout this document 
sources of revenues substantially all of our revenues are derived from contracts with fertility centers  fees from patients enrolled in our shared risk refund program and the sale of pharmaceutical products critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
basis of consolidation the consolidated financial statements comprise the accounts of integramed america  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
we do not have a controlling financial interest in any of the medical practices or the captive insurance company  to which we provide services and as a result  we do not consolidate their results 
revenue and cost recognition partner service fees under all eight of our partner agreements  we receive as compensation for our services in a three part fee comprised of i a tiered percentage of the fertility centers net revenues  ii reimbursed costs of services costs incurred in servicing a fertility center and any costs paid on behalf of the fertility center and iii a fixed percentage  or a fixed dollar amount  of the fertility centers earnings after services fees  which may be subject to additional limits 
all revenues from partner contracts are recorded in the period services are rendered 
direct costs incurred by us in performing our services and costs incurred on behalf of the medical practices are reported as costs of services 
revenue and costs are recognized in the same period in which the related services have been performed 
affiliate service fees under all twenty one of our affiliate agreements  we receive compensation for our services in a fixed fee dependent upon the level of service provided 
all revenues and costs from affiliate contracts are recorded in the period services are rendered 
shared risk refund program the shared risk refund program consists of a fertility treatment package that includes a fixed number of treatment cycles for one fixed price with a significant refund if the patient does not take home a baby 
we receive payment directly from consumers who qualify for the program and pay contracted fertility centers a defined reimbursement for each treatment cycle performed 
partial revenue representing the non refundable portion of the fixed fee is recorded upon the initiation of treatment  with remaining revenues recorded upon patients becoming pregnant 
a reserve is maintained for potentially refundable amounts if patients do not take home a baby 
expenses related to the program are recorded as incurred 
pharmaceutical sales revenues and related expenses from pharmaceutical sales are recorded upon shipment to customers 
prior to october   these revenues represented the actual sales value of the pharmaceuticals sold and we recorded cost of sales equal to the product cost 
subsequent to the october  amendment to our marketing agreement  our revenues are comprised of marketing fees related to these pharmaceutical sales as previously described under the caption major events impacting financial condition and results of operations 
patient financing a fertility treatment cycle can be an expensive process for which many patients do not have full medical insurance coverage 
as a service to these patients  we can arrange financing to qualified patients of our network at rates significantly lower than credit cards and other finance companies 
our financing operations are administered by a third party vendor and loans are made to qualified patients by an independent bank or finance organization 
we are not at risk for loan losses and receive a placement fee from the lender involved 
since many financing transactions are closely associated with our shared risk refund program  financing revenues  which we receive and record at the time the loans are closed  are reported as part of that program 
use of estimates our most significant estimates include a reserve for estimated refunds due to pregnancy loss in our shared risk refund program and the valuation allowance related to our deferred tax assets 
due to medical practices due to medical practices represents the net amounts owed by us to medical practices contracted as partners 
this balance is comprised of amounts due to us by the medical practices for funds which we advanced for use in financing their accounts receivable  less balances owed to the medical practices by us for undistributed physician earnings and patient deposits we hold on behalf of the medical practices 
exclusive service rights exclusive service rights represent payments we made for the right to service certain fertility centers and are valued at cost less accumulated amortization 
costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the length of the service contract  usually ten to twenty five years 
we periodically review our exclusive business service rights to assess recoverability  a charge would be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations if an impairment was determined to have occurred 
recoverability is determined based on undiscounted expected earnings from the related business over the remaining amortization period 
as of december   none of the exclusive service rights are considered to be impaired 
long lived assets under current accounting standards our long lived assets are subject to annual impairment testing and we may be subject to impairment losses as a result 
if we record an impairment loss  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the year in which the impairment is recorded 
as of december   none of our long lived assets were considered to be impaired 
results of operations the following table shows the percentage of net revenue represented by various expenses and other income items reflected in our statement of operations for the years ended december   and as reported revenues  net provider services consumer services total revenues costs of services incurred provider services consumer services total costs of service contribution provider services consumer services total contribution general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense total other expenses income from operations before income taxes 
income tax provision net income supplemental information to better understand our current operations  it is necessary to identify and eliminate the effects of the contract change for pharmaceutical revenue reporting and the effect of eliminating our valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset related to the future utilization of net operating loss carry forwards for tax purposes 
the adjustments reflected to arrive at the supplemental percentages of revenue were to reduce consumer services revenue and cost of services in by  and by  of pharmaceutical revenue to state the pharmaceutical revenue and costs on the same basis as the net revenue presentation see above discussion of the september contract amendment under the major events caption  and to increase the tax provision by  to eliminate the benefit from the elimination of the valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset 
to supplement our consolidated financial statements presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  we have provided these non gaap measures of financial performance as outlined above 
our reference to the non gaap measures should be considered in addition to the results prepared under current accounting standards  but are not a substitute for  nor superior to  gaap results 
specifically  we believe the non gaap measures provide useful information to both management and investors by isolating certain items that may not be indicative of our core operating results and business outlook 
the following table shows the percentage of net revenue represented by various expenses and other income items after giving effect to the supplemental adjustments referred to above  for the years ended december   and revenues  net provider services consumer services total revenues costs of services incurred provider services consumer services total costs of service contribution provider services consumer services total contribution general and administrative expenses interest income 
interest expense

they generate patient revenue  which we do not reflect in our financial statements as we do not consolidate the practices 
the growth of patient revenues positively impacts our revenues 
the components of our revenue from partner practices are a base service fee calculated as a percentage of patient revenue percentage varies from down to depending on the level of revenues  our reimbursement for the expenses  called cost of services  we advanced during the month representing substantially all of the expenses incurred by the practice and our additional fees which represent our share of the net income of the practice before physician compensation which varies from a fixed amount or to depending on the practice 
from the total of our revenues  we subtract the annual amortization of our business service rights 
in addition to revenues generated from partner practices  we receive fees from affiliate practices for marketing and other services

the increase is comprised of million of additional reimbursed cost of services due to higher patient revenue at the practices  a decrease in base service of million due to a decline in the average fee percentage from to as a result of practices achieving higher levels of revenue  a decline in additional fees of million primarily as a result of a fee level cap at one of the practices no significant declines are scheduled after and an increase of million in amortization expense 
revenues of the affiliates and other services increase by million as a result of three additional affiliates and the sale of additional information system services 
consumer services our shared risk refund program continues to see significant year to year growth with revenues of million  an increase of million  or  above revenues of million 
the program continues to grow in popularity and continues to increase its penetration of its target markets 
pharmaceutical revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
this reduction in revenue is entirely the result of a change in contract terms we initiated with our strategic partner in the pharmaceutical business 
revenues stated on the same basis as would have been million 
the decline is a result of decreasing margins due to drug cost increases which are not able to be passed on to the consumer as a result of competitive pressures 
margins should stabilize at the rates seen in the fourth quarter of contribution our contribution of million increased approximately million  or from s level of million 
as a percentage of reported revenue  our contribution margin increased to in versus in if the revenue was adjusted for the change in pharmaceutical sales  the contribution would be of revenue 
the following factors had a significant impact on contribution provider services contribution from our partner centers in was about level with and represented a decrease from of revenue to of related revenue primarily as a result of reaching a fee cap at one of the practices 
contribution at our remaining seven partners was approximately even with levels 
despite higher revenues  due to the planned phase in of fee reductions at three clinics which has been previously disclosed  the contribution remained near levels 
consumer services contribution from our shared risk refund program rose by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in higher patient volume and favorable pregnancy outcomes  especially during early treatment cycles  helped drive this performance 
pharmaceutical contribution was million in  down million  from million in this decrease in contribution  was driven by manufacturer price increases that were not able to be passed on to the consumer 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are comprised of salaries  benefits  corporate regulatory  operational and support costs not specifically related to our clinics or other product offerings 
these expenses increased million in  over levels 
while we experienced cost increases related to planned headcount and compensation increases required to generate and support our growing revenue streams and sarbanes oxley and other regulatory compliance efforts  we were able to control other costs to nearly offset the increases 
we measure general and administrative costs against contribution 
these costs were of contribution in and in interest interest income increased to million for the year ended december   from million in this increase is primarily attributed to interest income earned on higher investable cash balances maintained throughout and income earned from capital investments at several partner clinics where their capital requirements exceed thresholds of our normal financing levels 
interest expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million in  primarily as a result of interest charges on the higher average outstanding balances on our term loan through out the year 
provision for income taxes our provision for income tax was approximately million in or of pre tax income 
as discussed above  we recorded a reduction in the tax provision as a result of the elimination of a valuation reserve on our deferred tax assets 
the tax provision for would have been million had this adjustment not occurred and would have resulted in an effective tax rate of our effective tax rate for was approximately 
we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately 
the provisions for both and reflects both state and federal taxes

the increase is comprised of million of additional reimbursed cost of services due to higher patient revenue at the practices  an increase in base service fees of million  a flat additional fee level and a million increase in amortization expense 
the increases relate to our two most recently added partners in seattle and southern california who joined our network on january   and january  respectively 
the increases in the additional fees from the new clinics were offset by previously announced fee reduction in the three larger clinics 
revenues from our affiliate clinics were approximately million in  slightly below revenues of million in while the number of affiliated clinics grew from in december  to by december  reported revenues for are slightly below the prior year figure due to a decrease in certain marketing related services provided to the affiliates in consumer services our shared risk refund program continued to see significant year to year growth with revenues of million  an increase of million  or  above revenues of million 
the prospect of a potential refund  coupled with good treatment outcomes  as compared to industry averages  has resulted in continued strong patient enrollment in this program throughout our network 
pharmaceutical revenue was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
this reduction in revenue is entirely the result of a change in contract terms we initiated with our strategic partner in the pharmaceutical business in the fourth quarter of while these new contract terms will affect our revenue and related costs  it will have no impact on our margins or income 
as a result  reported revenues for are not directly comparable with results 
contribution our contribution of million increased approximately million  or from as a percentage of revenue  our contribution margin increased to in versus in on a pro forma basis  adjusting pharmaceutical revenue for the contract change  the contribution as a percentage of revenue would have been level at approximately

pharmaceutical contribution was million in  up million  or  from million in this increase in contribution  driven by increased product shipments  is a result of our continuing efforts to distribute our pharmaceutical services throughout our expanding network base 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses are comprised of salaries  benefits  corporate regulatory  operational and support costs not specifically related to our clinics or other product offerings 
these expenses increased million in  over levels

off balance sheet arrangements in december  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin r revised december  consolidation of variable interest entities  vie s which replaced fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  issued in january fin r addresses how a business enterprise should evaluate whether it has a controlling financial interest in an entity through means other than voting rights and accordingly should consolidate the entity 
as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or vie s  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we were not involved in any unconsolidated vie transactions 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents on hand as compared to million at december  additionally  we had working capital of approximately million  at december   an increase of million from working capital of million as of december  our increased liquidity is attributed cash generated from operations and working capital changes related to accruals and shared risk refund patient deposits 
shared risk refund patient deposits  which are reflected as a current liability  represent funds received from patients in advance of treatment cycles 
these deposits  which represent prepayments of future revenues from patients without full insurance coverage totaled approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
these deposits are a significant source of recurring cash flow and represent interest free financing for us 
as of december   we did not have any significant contractual commitments for the acquisition of fixed assets or construction of leasehold improvements  however  we have budgeted upcoming capital expenditures of approximately million for these expenditures are primarily related to the expansion of our existing partner centers 
we believe that working capital and  specifically  cash and cash equivalents remain at adequate levels to fund our operations 
we also believe that the cash flows from our operations plus our available credit facility will be sufficient to provide for our future liquidity needs for the next twelve months 
in december  we amended our existing credit facility with bank of america 
the amended facility is comprised of a million three year revolving line of credit and a million year term loan 
as of december   million of the term loan was outstanding with a remaining term of years 
proceeds of approximately million from the new term loan were used to repay the outstanding balance on our previous term loan with bank of america 
each component of this amended credit facility bears interest by reference to bank of america s prime rate or libor  at our option  plus a margin  which is dependent upon a leverage test  ranging from to in the case of libor based loans 
prime based loans are made at bank of america s prime rate and do not contain an additional margin 
interest on the prime based loans is payable monthly and interest on libor based loans is payable on the last day of each applicable interest period 
as of december   interest on both the term loan and revolving credit line were payable at a rate of approximately 
unused amounts under the working capital revolver bear a commitment fee of and are payable quarterly 
availability of borrowings under the working capital revolver is based on eligible accounts receivable  as defined in the credit agreement 
as of december   we had no outstanding balance on our million revolving line of credit 
due to lower eligible accounts receivable  resulting from increased collections  approximately million of the revolving line of credit was available to us 
in order to mitigate the interest rate risk associated with our term loan  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with bank of america in april the effect of this swap transaction was to effectively fix the interest rate on our term loan at  plus the applicable margin for the life of the loan 
our bank of america credit facility is collateralized by all of our assets 
as of december   we were in full compliance with all applicable debt covenants 
we are also continuously reviewing our credit agreements and may renew  revise or enter into new agreements from time to time as deemed necessary 
significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods

we also have commitments to provide working capital financing to our partner locations 
a significant portion of this commitment is our transactions with the medical practices themselves 
our responsibilities to the medical practices are to provide financing for their accounts receivable and to hold patient deposits on their behalf as well as undistributed physician earnings 
disbursements to the medical practices generally occur on or before the th business day of each month 
the medical practice s repayment hierarchy consists of the following i we provide a cash credit to the practice for billings to patients and insurance companies  ii we reduce the cash credit for clinic expenses that we have incurred on their behalf  iii we reduce the cash credit for the base portion of our service fee which relates to the partner revenues  iv we reduce the cash credit for the variable portion of our service fee which relates to the partner earnings  and v we disburse to the medical practice the remaining cash amount which represents the physicians undistributed earnings 
we are also responsible for the collection of the partner accounts receivables  which we finance with full recourse 
we continuously fund these needs from our cash flow from operations and the collection of the prior month s receivables 
if delays in repayment are incurred  which have not as yet been encountered  we could draw on our existing working capital line of credit 
we also make payments on behalf of the partner for which we are reimbursed in the short term 
other than these payments  as a general course  we do not make other advances to the medical practice 
we have no other funding commitments to the partner 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  or fin  no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the provisions of fin no 
are effective for fiscal years beginning after december   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
the company is in the final phase of evaluating the impact of adopting fin no 
we do not anticipate any significant impact to our financial position or results of operations as a result of applying this statement 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and will become effective for us beginning with the first quarter of we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on our financial statements and note disclosures 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 consideration of prior years errors in quantifying current year misstatements  the sec staff provides guidance concerning the process to be followed in considering the impact of prior years errors in quantifying misstatements in the current year 
to address diversity in practice  sec staff accounting bulletin expresses the sec staff s views regarding the process to be applied in considering the effects of prior years misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year s financial statements  correction of existing accumulated balance sheet misstatements ie  from immaterial errors in prior years should be accomplished by correcting the financial statements of affected previous years 
the staff notes  however  that in such a case  previously filed reports would not require amendment  rather  corrections should be made the next time such prior years statements are filed with the commission 
the guidance in sab no was applied to financial statements for the year ended december  in evaluating sab no  we do not believe that our financial statements contain such misstatements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and will become effective for us beginning with the first quarter of we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
on our financial statements and footnote disclosures 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business our interest income and expense items are sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates 
during the second quarter of we entered into a derivative transaction designed to hedge our variable interest rate term loan 
as a result of this derivative transaction we have successfully shielded ourselves from interest rate risks associated with this loan as the hedge instrument essentially converts the loan to a fixed rate instrument 
we are currently subject to interest rate risks associated with our short term investments and certain advances to our partner clinics  both of which are tied to either short term interest rates or the prime rate 
as of december   a one percent change in interest rates would impact our pre tax income by approximately  annually
