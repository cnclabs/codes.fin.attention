item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we cannot guarantee that our actual results will be consistent with the forward looking statements we make in this annual report 
you should review carefully the risk factors listed below  as well as those factors listed in other documents we file with the sec 
we note that additional risks not presently known to us or that we may currently deem immaterial may also impair our business and operations 
we do not assume an obligation to update any forward looking statement 
our level of indebtedness could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
as of december   we had approximately million of indebtedness outstanding  of which million is project debt of stendal 
we may also incur additional indebtedness in the future 
our high debt levels may have important consequences for us  including  but not limited to the following our ability to obtain additional financing to fund future operations or meet our working capital needs or any such financing may not be available on terms favorable to us or at all  a certain amount of our operating cash flow is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  thereby diminishing funds that would otherwise be available for our operations and for other purposes  a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows or increase in our expenses could make it more difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements  which could force us to modify our operations  and our leveraged capital structure may place us at a competitive disadvantage by hindering our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions or by making us vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the economy in general 
our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness will depend on our future financial and operating performance 
our performance  in turn  will be subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions  as well as financial  business  legislative  regulatory  industry and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
our ability to meet our future debt service and other obligations may depend in significant part on the success of the stendal mill and the extent to which we can implement successfully our business and growth strategy 
we cannot assure you that the stendal mill will be successful or that we will be able to implement our strategy fully or that the anticipated results of our strategy will be realized 
our business is highly cyclical in nature 
the pulp business is cyclical in nature and markets for our principal products are characterized by periods of supply and demand imbalance  which in turn affects product prices 
pulp markets are highly competitive and are sensitive to cyclical changes in the global economy  industry capacity and foreign exchange rates  all of which can have a significant influence on selling prices and our earnings 
the length and magnitude of industry cycles have varied over time but generally reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions and levels of industry capacity 
industry capacity can fluctuate as changing industry conditions can influence producers to idle production or permanently close machines or entire mills 
in addition  to avoid substantial cash costs in idling or closing a mill  some producers will choose to operate at a loss  sometimes even a cash loss  which can prolong weak pricing environments due to oversupply 
oversupply of our products can also result from producers introducing new capacity in response to favorable pricing trends 
demand for pulp has historically been determined by the level of economic growth and has been closely tied to overall business activity 
although pulp prices have improved commencing in the latter part of and through  we cannot predict the impact of future economic weakness in certain world markets or the impact of war  terrorist activity or other events on our markets 
prices for pulp are driven by many factors outside our control  and we have little influence over the timing and extent of price changes  which are often volatile 
because market conditions beyond our control determine the prices for our products  the price for pulp may fall below our cash production costs  requiring us to either incur short term losses on product sales or cease production at one or more of our manufacturing facilities 
therefore  our profitability with respect to pulp depends on managing our cost structure  particularly raw materials which represent a significant component of our operating costs and can fluctuate based upon factors beyond our control 
if the prices of our products decline  or if raw materials increase  or both  demand for our products may decline and our sales and profitability could be materially adversely affected 
our production costs are influenced by the availability and cost of raw materials  energy and labor  and our plant efficiencies and productivity 
our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips and pulp logs 
fiber costs are primarily affected by the supply of  and demand for  lumber which is highly cyclical in nature and can vary significantly by location 
production costs also depend on the total volume of production 
lower operating rates and production efficiencies during periods of cyclically low demand result in higher average production costs and lower margins 
cyclical fluctuations in the price and supply of our raw materials could adversely affect our business 
we rely heavily on fiber in our pulp manufacturing process 
wood chips and pulp logs comprise the fiber used by our mills 
such fiber is cyclical in terms of both price and supply 
the cost of wood chips and pulp logs is primarily affected by the supply and demand for lumber 
demand for these raw materials is determined by the volume of pulp produced globally and regionally 
recently  continued high energy prices  a focus on green or renewable energy and governmental initiatives have led to an increase in renewable energy projects in europe  including germany 
demand for wood residuals from such energy producers has put upward pressure on prices for wood residuals such as wood chips in germany and its neighboring countries 
this has resulted in higher fiber costs for our german pulp mills and such trend could continue to put further upward pressure on wood chip prices 
the markets for pulp are highly variable and are characterized by periods of excess product supply due to many factors  including periods of insufficient demand due to weak general economic activity or other causes 
the cyclical nature of pricing for these raw materials represents a potential risk to our profit margins if pulp producers are unable to pass along price increases to their customers 
we do not own any timberlands or have any long term governmental timber concessions nor do we have any long term fiber contracts at our german operations 
although raw materials are available from a number of suppliers  and we have not historically experienced material supply interruptions or substantial sustained price increases  our requirements have increased as the stendal mill is operating at full production capacity and as we increase the production capacity of our celgar mill  and we may not be able to purchase sufficient quantities of these raw materials to meet our production requirements at prices acceptable to us during times of tight supply 
in addition  the quality of fiber we receive could be reduced as a result of industrial disputes  material curtailments or shut down of operations by suppliers  government orders and legislation  weather conditions  transportation disruptions  acts of god and other events beyond our control 
an insufficient supply of fiber or reduction in the quality of fiber we receive would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
in addition to the supply of wood fiber  we are dependent on the supply of certain chemicals and other inputs used in our production facilities 
any disruption in the supply of these chemicals or other inputs could affect our ability to meet customer demand in a timely manner and would harm our reputation 
any material increase in the cost of these chemicals or other inputs could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we operate in highly competitive markets 
we sell our pulp globally  with a large percentage sold in europe  north america and asia 
the markets for pulp are highly competitive 
a number of other global companies compete in each of these markets and no company holds a dominant position 
for pulp  many companies produce products that are largely standardized 
as a result  the primary basis for competition in our markets has been price 
many of our competitors have greater resources and lower leverage than we do and may be able to adapt more quickly to industry or market changes or devote greater resources to the sale of products than we can 
there can be no assurance that we will continue to be competitive in the future 
our stendal mill is subject to risks commonly associated with a new large complex mill 
the stendal mill has been constructed near the town of stendal  germany 
the aggregate cost of the mill was approximately billion 
the performance of the stendal mill has had a material impact on our financial condition and operating performance 
the stendal mill was completed in september and thereafter commenced ramping up production 
as the stendal mill was completed relatively recently  it is subject to risks commonly associated with new  large  complex industrial projects which could result in it experiencing operating difficulties or delays 
as a result  the stendal mill may not achieve our planned production  timing  quality  environmental or cost projections  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
these risks include  without limitation  equipment failures or damage  errors or miscalculations in engineering  design specifications or equipment manufacturing  faulty construction or workmanship  defective equipment or installation  human error  industrial accidents  weather conditions  failure to comply with environmental and other permits  and complex integration of processes and equipment 
increases in our capital expenditures or maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
our business is capital intensive 
our annual capital expenditures may vary due to fluctuations in requirements for maintenance  business capital  expansion and as a result of changes to environmental regulations that require capital expenditures to bring our operations into compliance with such regulations 
in addition  our senior management and board of directors may approve projects in the future that will require significant capital expenditures 
increased capital expenditures could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and our ability to satisfy our debt obligations 
further  while we regularly perform maintenance on our manufacturing equipment  key pieces of equipment in our various production processes may still need to be repaired or replaced 
if we do not have sufficient funds or such repairs or replacements are delayed  the costs of repairing or replacing such equipment and the associated downtime of the affected production line could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
any failure by us to efficiently and effectively manage our growth could adversely affect our business 
expansion of our business  including increasing the production of the stendal and celgar mills  may place strains on our personnel  financial and other resources 
in order to successfully manage our growth we must identify  attract  motivate  train and retain skilled managerial  financial  engineering  business development  sales and marketing and other personnel 
competition for these types of personnel is intense 
if we fail to efficiently manage our growth and compete for these types of personnel  it could adversely affect the quality of our services and  in turn  materially adversely affect our business and the price of our shares 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate and interest rate fluctuations 
in  a large majority of our sales were in products quoted in us dollars while most of our operating costs and expenses  other than those of the celgar mill  were incurred in euros 
in addition  all of the products sold by the celgar mill are quoted in us dollars and the costs of the celgar mill are primarily incurred in canadian dollars 
our results of operations and financial condition are reported in euros 
as a result  our revenues have been adversely affected by the decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and to the canadian dollar 
such shifts in currencies relative to the euro and the canadian dollar reduce our operating margins and the cash flow available to fund our operations and to service our debt 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in  stendal entered into variable to fixed interest rate swaps to fix interest payments under the stendal mill financing facility  which had kept stendal from benefiting from the general decline in interest rates that ensued 
these derivatives are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and all unrealized gains and losses are recognized in earnings for the relevant reporting periods 
we use derivatives to manage certain risk which has caused significant fluctuations in our operating results 
a significant amount of our sales revenue is based on pulp sales quoted in us dollars while our reporting currency is euros and our costs are predominantly in euros and  since the acquisition of the celgar pulp mill  in canadian dollars 
we therefore use foreign currency derivative instruments primarily to try to manage against depreciation of the us dollar against the euro 
we also use derivative instruments to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
concurrently with entering into the stendal financing  stendal entered into variable to fixed rate interest swaps for the full term of the facility to manage its interest rate risk exposure with respect to a maximum aggregate amount of approximately million of the principal amount of such facility 
we record unrealized gains or losses on our derivative instruments when they are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and realized gains or losses on them when they are settled 
these unrealized and realized gains and losses can materially impact our operating results for any reporting period 
for example  our operating results for included realized and unrealized net gains of million on our currency and interest rate derivatives 
conversely  our operating results for included realized and unrealized losses of million on currency and interest rate derivatives 
in  we recorded a net realized gain of million on our currency derivatives and a net unrealized loss of million on our interest rate derivatives 
if any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize are not effective  we may incur losses which may have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
further  we may in the future use derivative instruments to manage pulp price risks 
the purpose of our derivative activity may also be considered speculative in nature  we do not use these instruments with respect to any pre set percentage of revenues or other formula  but either to augment our potential gains or reduce our potential losses depending on our perception of future economic events and developments 
we are subject to extensive environmental regulation and we could have environmental liabilities at our facilities 
our operations are subject to numerous environmental laws as well as permits  guidelines and policies 
these laws  permits  guidelines and policies govern  among other things unlawful discharges to land  air  water and sewers  waste collection  storage  transportation and disposal  hazardous waste  dangerous goods and hazardous materials and the collection  storage  transportation and disposal of such substances  the clean up of unlawful discharges  land use planning  municipal zoning  and employee health and safety 
in addition  as a result of our operations  we may be subject to remediation  clean up or other administrative orders  or amendments to our operating permits  and we may be involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings or inquiries 
future orders  proceedings or inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
environmental laws and land use laws and regulations are constantly changing 
new regulations or the increased enforcement of existing laws could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
in addition  compliance with regulatory requirements is expensive  at times requiring the replacement  enhancement or modification of equipment  facilities or operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our profitability by offsetting any increased costs of complying with future regulatory requirements 
we are subject to liability for environmental damage at the facilities that we own or operate  including damage to neighboring landowners  residents or employees  particularly as a result of the contamination of soil  groundwater or surface water and especially drinking water 
the costs of such liabilities can be substantial 
our potential liability may include damages resulting from conditions existing before we purchased or operated these facilities 
we may also be subject to liability for any off site environmental contamination caused by pollutants or hazardous substances that we or our predecessors arranged to transport  treat or dispose of at other locations 
in addition  we may be held legally responsible for liabilities as a successor owner of businesses that we acquire or have acquired 
except for stendal  our facilities have been operating for decades and we have not done invasive testing to determine whether or to what extent environmental contamination exists 
as a result  these businesses may have liabilities for conditions that we discover or that become apparent  including liabilities arising from non compliance with environmental laws by prior owners 
because of the limited availability of insurance coverage for environmental liability  any substantial liability for environmental damage could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
enactment of new environmental laws or regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations might require significant capital expenditures 
we may be unable to generate sufficient funds or access other sources of capital to fund unforeseen environmental liabilities or expenditures 
we are subject to risks related to our employees 
the majority of our employees are unionized 
the collective agreement relating to our pulp workers at the rosenthal mill expires in the third quarter of in addition  in the future we may enter into a collective agreement with our pulp workers at the stendal mill 
the collective agreement relating to our hourly workers at the celgar mill expires in although we have not experienced any work stoppages in the past  there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate acceptable collective agreements or other satisfactory arrangements with our employees upon the expiration of our collective agreements or in conjunction with the establishment of a new agreement or arrangement with our pulp workers at the stendal mill 
this could result in a strike or work stoppage by the affected workers 
the registration or renewal of the collective agreements or the outcome of our wage negotiations could result in higher wages or benefits paid to union members 
accordingly  we could experience a significant disruption of our operations or higher on going labor costs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
we rely on german federal and state government grants and guarantees 
we currently benefit from a subsidized capital expenditure program and lower cost of financing as a result of german federal and state government grants and guarantees at our stendal mill 
should either the german federal or state governments be prohibited from honoring legislative grants and guarantees at stendal  or should we be required to repay any such legislative grants  this may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
the sale of emission allowances is relatively new and volatile and subject to governmental amendment 
commencing in  our german operations became subject to the european emissions trading scheme 
over the last two years  we have benefited from the sales of emission allowances 
the market for emission allowances is relatively new and volatile 
further  the allocation of emission allowances  which is currently based upon production volumes and the types of fuels consumed by manufacturing facilities in germany  is subject to governmental review and potential changes in as a result  we cannot predict with any certainty either the amount of future sales of emission allowances or the amount of emission allowances we may be granted 
we are dependent on key personnel 
our future success depends  to a large extent  on the efforts and abilities of our executive and senior mill operating officers 
such officers are industry professionals many of whom have operated through multiple business cycles 
our officers play an integral role in  among other things sales and marketing  reducing operating costs  identifying capital projects which provide a high rate of return  and prioritizing expenditures and maintaining employee relations 
the loss of one or more of our officers could make us less competitive in these areas which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we do not maintain any key person life insurance on any of our executive or senior mill operating officers 
we may experience material disruptions to our production 
a material disruption at one of our manufacturing facilities could prevent us from meeting customer demand  reduce our sales and or negatively impact our results of operations 
any of our pulp manufacturing facilities could cease operations unexpectedly due to a number of events  including unscheduled maintenance outages  prolonged power failures  an equipment failure  design error or operator error  chemical spill or release  explosion of a boiler  disruptions in the transportation infrastructure  including roads  bridges  railway tracks and tunnels  fires  floods  earthquakes or other natural catastrophes  labour difficulties  and other operational problems 
any such downtime or facility damage could prevent us from meeting customer demand for our products and or require us to make unplanned capital expenditures 
if any of our facilities were to incur significant downtime  our ability to meet our production capacity targets and satisfy customer requirements would be impaired and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we rely on third parties for transportation services 
our business primarily relies upon third parties for the transportation of pulp to our customers  as well as for the delivery of our raw materials to our mills 
our pulp and raw materials are principally transported by truck  barge  rail and sea going vessels  all of which are highly regulated 
increases in transportation rates can also materially adversely affect our results of operation 
further  if our transportation providers fail to deliver our pulp in a timely manner  it could negatively impact our customer relationships and we may be unable to sell it at full value 
if our transportation providers fail to deliver our raw materials in a timely fashion  we may be unable to manufacture pulp in response to customer orders 
also  if any of our transportation providers were to cease operations  we may be unable to replace them at a reasonable cost 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing events could materially adversely affect our results of operations 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate 
we have obtained insurance coverage that we believe would ordinarily be maintained by an operator of facilities similar to our pulp mills 
our insurance is subject to various limits and exclusions 
damage or destruction to our facilities could result in claims that are excluded by  or exceed the limits of  our insurance coverage 
washington state law and our articles of incorporation may have anti takeover effects which will make an acquisition of our company by another company more difficult 
we are subject to the provisions of the revised code of washington  chapter b  which prohibits a washington corporation  including our company  from engaging in any business combination with an acquiring person for a period of five years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an acquiring person  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner 
a business combination includes mergers  asset sales as well as certain transactions resulting in a financial benefit to the acquiring person 
subject to certain exceptions  an acquiring person is a person who  together with affiliates and associates  owns  or within five years did own  or more of the corporation s voting stock 
we may in the future adopt certain measures that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company 
certain of such measures  including  without limitation  a shareholder rights plan  may be adopted without any further vote or action by the holders of our shares 
these measures may have anti takeover effects  which may delay  defer or prevent a takeover attempt that a holder of our shares might consider in its best interest

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations as at and for the three years ended december  is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the results of operations of our stendal mill since it commenced production in september and the results of operations and financial condition of the celgar mill from the time of its acquisition in february  the disposition of our paper operations in in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the results of this business have been classified as discontinued operations and their financial results are reported separately as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
previously reported financial statements for all periods and certain amounts in our financial statements and related notes included herein have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation  and only our continuing operations except as otherwise expressly noted 
results of operations we operate in the pulp business and our operations are located in germany and western canada 
our pulp mills are comprised of a an nbsk pulp mill operated by our wholly owned subsidiary  rosenthal  near blankenstein  germany  which has an annual production capacity of approximately  admts  b a new  state of the art nbsk pulp mill  with a production capacity of approximately  admts per year  near stendal  germany owned and operated by our owned subsidiary  stendal  and c the celgar nbsk pulp mill operated by our wholly owned subsidiary  celgar  with an annual production capacity of approximately  admts located near castlegar  british columbia  canada 
the stendal mill was completed and commenced production in mid september prior to such date  most of the costs associated with the stendal mill  including interest  were capitalized 
total investment costs in respect of the stendal mill were approximately billion 
the stendal mill underwent extensive testing and evaluation in december and  in the first quarter of  we delivered an acceptance certificate and assumed responsibility for the operation of the mill 
in february  we acquired the celgar pulp mill for approximately million million  excluding defined working capital 
since its acquisition  we have integrated the mill with our operations and expect to complete an approximately c million capital improvement project at the mill in mid in  we disposed of our paper operations and are no longer in such business 
these operations are reported separately as discontinued operations 
our financial performance depends on a number of variables that impact sales and production costs 
sales and production results are influenced largely by the market price for products and raw materials  the mix of products produced and foreign currency exchange rates 
kraft pulp markets are highly cyclical  with prices determined by supply and demand 
demand for kraft pulp is influenced to a significant degree by global levels of economic activity and supply is driven by industry capacity and utilization rates 
our product mix is important because premium grades of nbsk pulp generally achieve higher prices and profit margins 
our production costs are influenced by the availability and cost of raw materials  energy and labor  and our plant efficiencies and productivity 
our main raw material is fiber in the form of wood chips and pulp logs 
wood chip and pulp log costs are primarily affected by the supply of  and demand for  lumber and pulp  which are both highly cyclical 
production costs also depend on the total volume of production 
high operating rates and production efficiencies permit us to lower our average cost by spreading fixed costs over more units 
global economic conditions  changes in production capacity and inventory levels are the primary factors affecting kraft pulp prices 
historically  kraft pulp prices have been cyclical in nature 
the average annual european list prices for nbsk pulp between and ranged from a low of per admt in to a high of per admt in list prices for nbsk pulp in europe increased overall in from approximately per admt at the start of the year to per admt at the end 
prices increased primarily due to the relatively weak us dollar and improving world economies 
list prices for nbsk pulp weakened in primarily due to the strengthening of the us dollar and were approximately per admt in europe in december pulp prices increased steadily in primarily as a result of the closure of several pulp mills  particularly in north america  which reduced nbsk pulp capacity by approximately million admts  better demand and the general weakness of the us dollar 
at the end of  list prices for nbsk pulp in northern europe had increased to approximately per admt 
a producer s sales realizations will reflect customer discounts  commissions and other items and nbsk pulp prices will continue to fluctuate in the future 
our financial performance for any reporting period is also impacted by changes in the us dollar to euro and canadian dollar exchange rate and in interest rates 
changes in currency rates affect our operating results because the price for our principal product  nbsk pulp  is generally based on a global industry benchmark that is quoted in us dollars  even though a significant portion of the sales from our german mills is invoiced in euros 
therefore  a weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar will generally reduce the amount of revenues of our pulp operations 
most of our operating costs at our german mills  including our debt obligations under the stendal loan facility and rosenthal working capital facility  are incurred in euros 
most of our operating costs at the celgar mill  including under its working capital facility  are in canadian dollars 
these costs do not fluctuate with the us dollar to euro or canadian dollar exchange rates 
thus  a weakening of the us dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar tends to reduce our sales revenue  gross profit and income from operations 
we seek to mitigate the effect of such weakening against the euro through foreign currency derivatives we put into place from time to time to protect against such currency movements 
changes in interest rates can impact our operating results because the credit facilities established for our pulp mills provide for floating rates of interest 
changes in currency exchange and interest rates also impact certain foreign currency and interest rate derivatives used by stendal and rosenthal from time to time to partially protect against the effect of such changes 
gains or losses on such derivatives are included in our earnings  either as they are settled or as they are marked to market for each reporting period

stendal  as required under its project financing  entered into variable to fixed rate interest swaps  referred to as the stendal interest rate swaps  in august to fix the interest rate on approximately million of indebtedness for the full term of the stendal loan facility 
rosenthal had also entered into forward interest rate and interest cap contracts  referred to as the rosenthal interest rate contracts and  together with the stendal interest rate swaps  the interest rate contracts  in respect of a portion of its long term indebtedness under its previous project loan facility 
the rosenthal interest rate contracts were settled in february in connection with the repayment of such loan facility

in  we recorded a negligible realized loss upon the settlement of the rosenthal interest rate contracts and a net unrealized non cash holding loss of million before minority interests on the stendal interest rate contracts 
improving world economies resulted in an increase in long term interest rates in if world economies continue to strengthen  we would expect interest rates to continue to rise 
higher interest rates could result in our recording marked to market non cash holding gains on the stendal interest rate contracts in future periods 
however  a fall in interest rates could result in our recording non cash holding losses on the stendal interest rate contracts in future periods when they are marked to market 
selected production  sales and exchange rate data for each of our last three years is as follows years ended december  admts pulp production pulp sales by volume revenues nbsk list prices in europe admt average pulp price realizations admt average spot currency exchange rates c c excluding intercompany sales volumes of   and  admts of pulp and intercompany net sales revenues of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  in the year ended december   revenues increased by approximately to million from million in  primarily as a result of higher pulp prices and higher sales volumes at our stendal and celgar mills 
pulp prices increased steadily in primarily as a result of the closure of several pulp mills  particularly in north america  which reduced nbsk capacity by approximately million admts  better demand and the general weakness of the us dollar against the euro and the canadian dollar 
list prices for nbsk pulp in europe were approximately per admt in  compared to approximately per admt in at the end of  list prices increased to approximately per admt in europe and between and per admt in asia  depending upon the country of delivery 
at december   norscan producers inventories for softwood kraft were at days supply  compared to days at the end of pulp sales realizations increased to per admt on average in from per admt in  primarily as a result of higher pulp prices 
cost of sales and general  administrative and other expenses increased to million in the year ended december  from million in  primarily as a result of higher sales volume  partially offset by a reversal of accruals for wastewater fees of million 
in  german environmental authorities confirmed that certain initiatives and capital expenditures undertaken by us qualified to offset such fees 
beginning in  our german operations became subject to the european union emissions trading scheme  pursuant to which our german mills have been granted emission allowances 
we recorded a contribution to income from the sale of emission allowances of million and million in and  respectively 
on average  our fiber costs for our german mills increased by approximately compared to as a result of both a supply imbalance and increased demand 
the supply imbalance resulted primarily from low harvest levels during the severe winter conditions in late and early in central europe 
such low harvest levels were not made up over the course of the year 
the increase in demand resulted from demand for wood residuals from alternative or renewable energy producers 
these factors contributed to upward pressure on fiber prices in the latter half of and for fiber deliveries into the start of severe winter storms in central europe in january reportedly caused the downfall of over million cubic meters of wood 
this wood will need to be harvested and processed in a timely manner and we expect this to increase the fiber supply to our german mills and to temper and moderate fiber prices in the second half of in  fiber costs for our celgar mill increased by approximately over the prior year  primarily because of fluctuations in regional wood chip availability caused by slumping north american lumber markets 
depreciation for the pulp operations increased to million in the current period  from million in  primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of depreciation at our celgar mill 
for the year ended december   operating income increased almost fourfold to million from million in the prior year  primarily as a result of overall higher pulp prices and sales volumes and improved productivity at our stendal and celgar mills 
interest expense in the year ended december  increased to million from million a year ago because of the inclusion of a full year s interest on our senior notes issued in february and million of interest expense recorded on the repurchase of approximately million principal amount of our convertible notes

operating ebitda is calculated by adding depreciation and amortization and non recurring capital asset impairment charges of million and million to the operating income from continuing operations of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
management uses operating ebitda as a benchmark measurement of its own operating results  and as a benchmark relative to its competitors 
management considers it to be a meaningful supplement to operating income as a performance measure primarily because depreciation expense and non recurring capital asset impairment charges are not an actual cash cost  and depreciation expense varies widely from company to company in a manner that management considers largely independent of the underlying cost efficiency of their operating facilities 
in addition  we believe operating ebitda is commonly used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate our financial performance 
operating ebitda does not reflect the impact of a number of items that affect our net income loss  including financing costs and the effect of derivative instruments 
operating ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss or income loss from operations as a measure of performance  nor as an alternative to net cash from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
operating ebitda has significant limitations as an analytical tool  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are that operating ebitda does not reflect i our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  ii changes in  or cash requirements for  working capital needs  iii the significant interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  on our outstanding debt  iv minority interests on our stendal nbsk pulp mill operations  v the impact of realized or marked to market changes in our derivative positions  which can be substantial  and vi operating ebitda does not reflect the impact of impairment charges against our investments or assets 
because of these limitations  operating ebitda should only be considered as a supplemental performance measure and should not be considered as a measure of liquidity or cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
see the statement of cash flows set out in our consolidated financial statements included herein 
because all companies do not calculate operating ebitda in the same manner  operating ebitda as calculated by us may differ from operating ebitda or ebitda as calculated by other companies 
we compensate for these limitations by using operating ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance and relying primarily on our gaap financial statements

pulp sales realizations decreased to per admt on average in the year ended december  from per admt in  primarily as a result of lower price realizations of the stendal and celgar mills 
the stendal mill sold pulp at a discounted price as a result of its ramp up and the celgar mill sold a large portion of its production in asian markets which had lower prices than european markets

at december   the restricted group had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at the end of at december   the restricted group had working capital of million 
we expect the restricted group to meet its interest and debt service expenses and meet the working and maintenance capital requirements for its current operations from cash flow from operations  cash on hand and two working capital facilities for the rosenthal and celgar mills in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization  asset impairments  derivative financial instruments  environmental conservation  asset retirement obligations  pensions and post retirement benefit obligations  income taxes  and contingencies 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
our management routinely makes judgments and estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
as the number of variables and assumptions affecting the probable future resolution of the uncertainties increase  these judgments become even more subjective and complex 
we have identified certain accounting policies  described below  that are the most important to the portrayal of our current financial condition and results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our annual audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
derivative instruments 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities effective january  derivative instruments are measured at fair value and reported in the balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
accounting for gains or losses depends on the intended use of the derivative instruments 
gains or losses on derivative instruments which are not designated hedges are recognized in earnings in the period of the change in fair value 
accounting for gains or losses on derivative instruments designated as hedges depends on the type of hedge and these gains or losses are recognized in either earnings or other comprehensive income 
we reported a net unrealized non cash holding gain of million before minority interests in respect of the stendal interest rate contracts 
we also reported a net unrealized non cash holding gain of million in respect of the currency derivatives that were outstanding at the end of and a net realized loss of million in respect of the currency derivatives settled in impairment of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
in performing the review of recoverability  we estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require our management to make subjective judgments 
in addition  the time periods for estimating future cash flows is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity of the assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
our management considers the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred tax assets which are comprised primarily of tax loss carryforwards and deductible temporary differences  both of which will reduce taxable income in the future 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a periodic basis to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the deferred tax assets will be realized  based on currently available information  including  but not limited to  the following the history of the tax loss carryforwards and their expiry dates  our projected earnings  and tax planning opportunities 
if we believe that it is more likely than not that some of these deferred tax assets will not be realized  based on currently available information  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded against these deferred tax assets 
as at december   we had million in deferred tax assets and million in valuation allowances  resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million 
if market conditions improve or tax planning opportunities arise in the future  we will reduce our valuation allowances  resulting in future tax benefits 
if market conditions deteriorate in the future  we will increase our valuation allowances  resulting in future tax expenses 
any change in tax laws  particularly in germany  will change the valuation allowances in future periods 
environmental 
our operations are subject to a wide range of federal  state  provincial and local environmental laws and regulations  dealing primarily with water  air and land pollution control 
in recent years  we have devoted significant financial and management resources to comply with all applicable environmental laws and regulations 
we believe our operations are currently in substantial compliance with the requirements of all applicable environmental laws and regulations and our respective operating permits 
under german state environmental rules relating to effluent discharges  industrial users are required to pay wastewater fees based upon the amount of their effluent discharge 
these rules also provide that an industrial user which undertakes environmental capital expenditures and lowers certain effluent discharges to prescribed levels may offset the amount of these expenditures against the wastewater fees that they would otherwise be required to pay in a three year period 
the requirement and timing of capital expenditures and the amount of wastewater fee charges are subject to negotiation with german government agencies 
as a result  we believe that our capital investment programs for our german manufacturing plants will largely offset the wastewater fees that would have been payable for the past three years  subject to environmental audits 
we estimate the aggregate wastewater fees offset by capital expenditures for the past three years to be approximately million 
other than wastewater fees  we accrue for environmental remediation liabilities on a site by site basis when it is probable that costs can be reasonably estimated  or as a result of an environmental action or claim  environmental studies that we conduct or regulatory assessment 
as at december   we recorded a liability for environmental conservation expenditures of million  based on environmental studies that we conducted 
we believe that the liability amount recorded is sufficient  subject to future changes in environmental regulations 
new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statement no 
  and r sfas 
this statement requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position an asset of a plan s over funded status or a liability for a plan s under funded status  measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year with limited exceptions  and recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  in accordance with the effective dates and transition guidelines of this standard  the company has adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas effective december   the most notable of which is the recognition of the funded status 
prior to the adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 the company accounted for its postretirement benefits under sfas no 
and sfas no 
under these standards  changes in the funded status were not immediately recognized  but instead were deferred and recognized in a systematic manner in later periods 
the adoption of this standard requires issuers to recognize the change in the funded status of the plan through other comprehensive income 
upon adoption of the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 the company recognized the amounts of prior changes in funded status of postretirement obligations through accumulated other comprehensive income 
the adoption of sfas no 
had no effect on the company s consolidated statement of operations for the years ended december   or for a discussion of other new accounting standards see note to our annual audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
cautionary statement regarding forward looking information statements in this annual report that are not reported financial results or other historical information are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  as amended 
these statements use forward looking terminology  are based on present information we have related to our existing business circumstances and various assumptions we make and involve a number of risks and uncertainties  any of which could cause actual results to differ materially from these forward looking statements 
we caution you that we do not assume any obligation to update forward looking statements based on unanticipated events or changed expectations 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  but are not limited to those set forth under item a 
risk factors 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on revenues or income during item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the exchange rates between the euro and the us dollar and  since  the canadian dollar versus the us dollar and the euro 
changes in these rates may affect our results of operations and financial condition and  consequently  our fair value 
we seek to manage these risks through internal risk management policies as well as the use of derivatives 
we use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to interest rate and currency risks 
we may in the future use derivatives to reduce or limit our exposure to fluctuations in pulp prices 
we also use derivatives to reduce our potential losses or to augment our potential gains  depending on our management s perception of future economic events and developments 
these types of derivatives are generally highly speculative in nature 
they are also very volatile as they are highly leveraged given that margin requirements are relatively low in proportion to notional amounts 
many of our strategies  including the use of derivatives  and the types of derivatives selected by us  are based on historical trading patterns and correlations and our management s expectations of future events 
however  these strategies may not be effective in all market environments or against all types of risks 
unexpected market developments may affect our risk management strategies during this time  and unanticipated developments could impact our risk management strategies in the future 
if any of the variety of instruments and strategies we utilize are not effective  we may incur significant losses 
derivatives derivatives are contracts between two parties where payments between the parties are dependent upon movements in the price of an underlying asset  index or financial rate 
examples of derivatives include swaps  options and forward rate agreements 
the notional amount of the derivatives is the contract amount used as a reference point to calculate the payments to be exchanged between the two parties and the notional amount itself is not generally exchanged by the parties 
the principal derivatives we use are foreign exchange derivatives and interest rate derivatives 
foreign exchange derivatives include currency swaps which involve the exchange of fixed payments in one currency for the receipt of fixed payments in another currency 
such cross currency swaps involve the exchange of both interest and principal amounts in two different currencies 
they also include foreign exchange forwards which are contractual obligations in which two counterparties agree to exchange one currency for another at a specified price for settlement at a pre determined future date 
forward contracts are effectively tailor made agreements that are transacted between counterparties in the over the counter market 
interest rate derivatives include interest rate forwards forward rate agreements which are contractual obligations to buy or sell an interest rate sensitive financial instrument on a future date at a specified price 
forward contracts are effectively tailor made agreements that are transacted between different counterparties in the over the counter market 
they also include interest rate swaps which are over the counter contracts in which two counterparties exchange interest payments based upon rates applied to a notional amount 
we use foreign exchange derivatives to convert some of our costs including currency swaps relating to our long term indebtedness from euros to us dollars as our principal product is priced in us dollars 
we have also converted some of our costs to us dollars by issuing long term us dollar denominated debt in the form of our convertible subordinated notes and million senior notes issued in february the proceeds of the senior notes were used in part to repay the rosenthal project loan facility 
we use interest rate derivatives to fix the rate of interest on indebtedness  including under the stendal loan facility and  prior to its repayment in february  the rosenthal project loan facility 
all of the derivatives we entered into were either pursuant to a project loan facility related to the rosenthal mill  which was repaid and discharged in february  or the stendal loan facility 
each of these loan facilities provided facilities for foreign exchange derivatives  interest rate derivatives and commodities derivatives  subject to prescribed controls  including maximum notional and at risk amounts 
the stendal loan facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the stendal mill and has the benefit of certain german governmental guarantees 
prior to its discharge in  the project loan facility for the rosenthal mill was secured by substantially all of the mill s assets and also had the benefit of certain german governmental grants 
neither of these credit facilities had any separate margin requirements when derivatives are entered into pursuant to their terms and are subsequently marked to market 
the revolving working capital credit facility we established in february for the rosenthal mill allows us to enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to its operations 
we record unrealized gains and losses on our outstanding derivatives when they are marked to market at the end of each reporting period and realized gains or losses on them when they are settled 
we determine market valuations based primarily upon valuations provided by our counterparties 
in march  rosenthal entered into currency derivatives which included two currency swaps in the aggregate principal amount of million that mature in september and september  respectively 
as nbsk pulp prices are quoted in us dollars and the majority of our business transactions are denominated in euros  rosenthal had entered into the currency swaps to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro on notional amounts outstanding under its project loan facility 
under these currency swaps  rosenthal effectively paid the principal and interest in us dollars and at us dollar borrowing rates 
the rosenthal currency derivatives also included a currency forward in the notional amount of million which matured in march that was entered into to reduce or limit rosenthal s exposure to currency risks 
in august  stendal entered into the stendal interest rate swaps in connection with its long term indebtedness relating to the stendal mill to fix the interest rate under the stendal loan facility at the then low level  relative to its historical trend and projected variable interest rate 
these contracts were entered into under a specific credit line under the stendal loan facility and are subject to prescribed controls  including certain maximum amounts for notional and at risk amounts 
under the stendal interest rate swaps  stendal pays a fixed rate and receives a floating rate with the interest payments being calculated on a notional amount 
the interest rates payable under the stendal loan facility were swapped into fixed rates based on the eur euribor rate for the repayment periods of the tranches under the stendal loan facility 
stendal effectively converted the stendal loan facility from a variable interest rate loan into a fixed interest rate loan  thereby reducing interest rate uncertainty 
in march  stendal also entered into currency derivatives which are comprised of a currency swap in the principal amount of million which matures in april and a currency forward contract for the notional amount of million maturing in march to reduce or limit its exposure to currency risks and to augment its potential gains or reduce its potential losses 
in december  we settled all of our then outstanding currency derivatives due to the substantial weakening of the us dollar versus the euro in and realized a gain of million thereon 
in february  we settled the rosenthal interest rate contracts in connection with the repayment and discharge of rosenthal s project loan facility and realized a loss of million thereon 
in the first quarter of  stendal entered into foreign currency derivatives in order to swap approximately three quarters of its long term indebtedness outstanding under the stendal mill s project loan facility into us dollars as follows i approximately million in principal amount was swapped into us dollars at a rate of with a maturity in october  and ii approximately million in principal amount was swapped into us dollars at a rate of with a maturity in october in the second quarter of  stendal swapped the balance of its long term indebtedness under the stendal mill s project loan facility  being approximately million in principal amount  into us dollars at a rate of with a maturity in october all of these currency swaps were entered into by stendal to reduce the effects of exchange rate fluctuations between the us dollar and the euro on notional amounts under the stendal loan facility 
during the first quarter of  stendal entered into a million currency forward contract at a rate of which matured in february and a million currency forward at a rate of which matured in september during the second quarter of  stendal entered into a million currency forward contract at a rate of which also matured in september in the third quarter of  stendal entered into a million currency forward at a rate of which matured in october these currency derivatives were entered into by stendal to reduce or limit its exposure to currency risks 
we are exposed to very modest credit related risks in the event of non performance by counterparties to derivative contracts 
however  we do not expect that the counterparties  which are major financial institutions  will fail to meet their obligations

these derivatives were settled in february in connection with the stendal loan facility  in the third quarter of stendal entered into the stendal interest rate swap agreements  which are variable to fixed interest rate swaps  for the term of the stendal loan facility  with respect to an aggregate maximum amount of approximately million of the principal amount of the long term indebtedness under the stendal loan facility 
the swaps took effect on october  and are comprised of three contracts 
the first contract commenced in october for a notional amount of million  gradually increasing to million  with an interest rate of  and matured in may the second contract commenced in may for a notional amount of million  gradually increasing to million  with an interest rate of  and matured in april the third contract commenced in april for a notional amount of million  with an interest rate of  and the notional amount gradually decreases and the contract terminates upon the maturity of the stendal loan facility in october as at december  and  the notional amounts of the remaining outstanding contract were million and million  respectively

currency forward entered into in the first quarter of in the notional amount of million at a rate of which matured in february interest rate risk fluctuations in interest rates may affect the fair value of fixed interest rate financial instruments which are sensitive to such fluctuations
