item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk 
if our access to hca information technology and services  inc s information systems is restricted or we are not able to integrate changes to our existing information systems or information systems of acquired hospitals  our operations could suffer 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems to process clinical and financial information 
information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology 
we rely heavily on hca information technology and services  inc  or hca it  for information systems 
under a contract with a term that will expire on december   hca it provides us with financial  clinical  patient accounting and network information services 
we do not control hca it s systems  and if these systems fail or are interrupted  if our access to these systems is limited in the future or if hca it develops systems more appropriate for the urban healthcare market and not suited for our hospitals  our operations could suffer 
hca has recently been taken private in a leveraged buyout 
we do not know of hca s future plans for the information systems and its support of such systems 
we also do not know if hca it is committed to extend our contract beyond system conversions are costly  time consuming and disruptive for physicians 
table of contents and employees 
should we decide to convert away from systems provided by hca it  such implementation could be costly and materially affect our results of operations 
in addition  as new information systems are developed in the future  we will need to integrate them into our existing systems 
evolving industry and regulatory standards  such as hipaa regulations  may require changes to our information systems in the future 
we may not be able to integrate new systems or changes required to our existing systems or systems of acquired hospitals in the future effectively or on a cost efficient basis 
a key element of our long term business strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional acute care hospitals 
our acquisition activity requires transitions from  and the integration of  various information systems that are used by the hospitals we acquire 
if we experience difficulties with the integration of the information systems of acquired hospitals  we could suffer  among other things  operational disruptions and increases in administrative expenses 
if our fair value declines  a material non cash charge to earnings from impairment of our goodwill could result 
we recorded a significant portion of the province purchase price as goodwill 
we have also recorded as goodwill a portion of the purchase price for many of our hospital acquisitions 
at december   we had approximately  million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect to recover the carrying value of this goodwill through our future cash flows 
we evaluate annually  based on our fair value  whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired 
if the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired  we may incur a material non cash charge to earnings 
we may have difficulty acquiring hospitals on favorable terms and  because of regulatory scrutiny  acquiring not for profit entities 
one element of our business strategy is expansion through the acquisition of acute care hospitals in non urban markets 
we face significant competition to acquire other attractive non urban hospitals  and we may not find suitable acquisitions on favorable terms 
our principal competitors for acquisitions have included health management associates  inc  community health systems  inc  triad hospitals  inc and newly capitalized start up companies 
we may not be able to obtain financing  if necessary  for any acquisitions or joint ventures that we might make or may be required to borrow at higher rates and on less favorable terms 
we may incur or assume additional indebtedness as a result of acquisitions 
our failure to acquire non urban hospitals consistent with our growth plans could prevent us from increasing our revenues 
the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations  depending on various factors  including the amount paid for the acquisition  the acquired hospital s results of operations  allocation of purchase price  effects of subsequent legislation and limitations on rate increases 
in the past  we have occasionally experienced temporary delays in improving the operating margins or effectively integrating the operations of our acquired hospitals 
in the future  if we are unable to improve the operating margins of acquired hospitals  operate them profitably or effectively integrate their operations  we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy 
in recent years  the legislatures and attorneys general of several states have become more interested in sales of hospitals by not for profit entities 
this heightened scrutiny may increase the cost and difficulty  or prevent the completion  of transactions with not for profit organizations in the future 
we may encounter numerous business risks in acquiring additional hospitals and may have difficulty operating and integrating those hospitals 
as a result  we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy 
we may be unable to timely and effectively integrate the hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations 
we may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals 
integrating a new hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business  negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel 
in addition  acquisition activity requires transitions from  and the integration of  operations and  usually  information systems that are 
table of contents used by acquired hospitals 
we will rely heavily on hca for information systems integration as part of a contractual arrangement for information technology services 
we may not be successful in causing hca to convert our newly acquired hospitals information systems  including those used by the province hospitals  in a timely manner 
in addition  we also may acquire businesses  including the province hospitals  with unknown or contingent liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations  medical and general professional liabilities  worker s compensation liabilities  previous tax liabilities and unacceptable business practices 
although we have historically obtained  and we intend to continue to obtain  contractual indemnification from sellers covering these matters  we did not obtain indemnification in the province business combination and any indemnification obtained from other sellers may be insufficient to cover material claims or liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses 
if we do not effectively recruit and retain qualified physicians  nurses  medical technicians and other healthcare professionals  our ability to deliver healthcare services efficiently will be adversely affected 
physicians generally direct our hospital admissions and services 
our success  in part  depends on the number and quality of physicians on our hospitals medical staffs  the admissions practices of these physicians and the maintenance of good relations with these physicians 
only a limited number of physicians practice in the non urban communities where our hospitals are located 
the primary method we employ to add or expand medical services is the recruitment of new physicians into our communities 
the success of our recruiting efforts will depend on several factors 
in general  there is a shortage of specialty care physicians 
we face intense competition in the recruitment and retention of specialists because of the difficulty in convincing these individuals of the benefits of practicing or remaining in practice in non urban communities 
if the growth rate slows in the non urban communities where our hospitals operate  then we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining physicians to practice in our communities 
generally  the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent approximately and of our inpatient revenues and admissions  respectively 
the loss of one or more of these physicians could cause a material reduction in our revenues  which could take significant time to replace given the challenges we face in recruiting and retaining physicians 
we may not be able to recruit all of the physicians we have targeted 
in addition  we may incur increased malpractice expense if the quality of such physicians does not meet our expectations 
there is generally a shortage of nurses and certain medical technicians in the healthcare field 
our hospitals may be forced to hire contract personnel  which tend to be more expensive than full time employed staff if they are unable to recruit and retain full time employees 
the shortage of nurses and medical technicians may affect our ability to deliver healthcare services efficiently 
our revenues may decline if federal or state programs reduce our medicare or medicaid payments or if managed care companies reduce reimbursement amounts 
in addition  the financial condition of purchasers of healthcare services and healthcare cost containment initiatives may limit our revenues and profitability 
in  we derived of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
in recent years  federal and state governments have made significant changes in the medicare and medicaid programs 
a number of states have incurred budget deficits and adopted legislation designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to reduce medicaid enrollees 
employers have also passed more healthcare benefit costs on to employees to reduce the employers health insurance expenses 
this trend has caused the self pay deductible component of healthcare services to become more common 
this payor shifting increases collection costs and reduces overall collections 
during the past several years  major purchasers of healthcare  such as federal and state governments  insurance companies and employers  have undertaken initiatives to revise payment methodologies and monitor healthcare costs 
as part of their efforts to contain healthcare costs  purchasers increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures or the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk 
table of contents through prepaid capitation arrangements  often in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans 
we expect efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors to continue  thereby reducing the payments we receive for our services 
in addition  these payors have instituted policies and procedures to substantially reduce or limit the use of inpatient services 
our revenues are especially concentrated in a small number of states which will make us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in those states 
our revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in kentucky  virginia  louisiana  new mexico  tennessee  alabama  west virginia and texas 
the following table which includes the revenues of the province hospitals since april   the date of the province business combination contains our revenues and revenues as a percentage of our total revenues by state for each of these states for the years presented dollars in millions revenue concentration by state amount of total revenues kentucky virginia louisiana new mexico tennessee alabama west virginia texas accordingly  any change in the current demographic  economic  competitive or regulatory conditions in the above mentioned states could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or prospects 
other hospitals and outpatient facilities provide services similar to those which we offer 
in addition  physicians provide services in their offices that could be provided in our hospitals 
these factors may increase the level of competition we face and may therefore adversely affect our revenues  profitability and market share 
competition among hospitals and other healthcare service providers  including outpatient facilities  has intensified in recent years  and we compete with other hospitals  including larger tertiary care centers located in larger metropolitan areas  and with physicians who provide services in their offices which would otherwise be provided in our hospitals 
although the hospitals which compete with us may be a significant distance away from our facilities  patients in our markets may migrate on their own to  may be referred by local physicians to  or may be encouraged by their health plan to travel to these hospitals 
furthermore  some of the hospitals which compete with us may use equipment and services more specialized than those available at our hospitals 
also  some of the hospitals that compete with our facilities are owned by tax supported governmental agencies or not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions 
these hospitals  in most instances  are also exempt from paying sales  property and income taxes 
in  cms began making public performance data relating to ten quality measures that hospitals submit in connection with their medicare reimbursement 
if any of our hospitals should achieve poor results or results that are lower than our competitors on these ten quality criteria  patient volumes could decline 
in the future  other trends toward clinical transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volume 

table of contents we also face increasing competition from other specialized care providers  including outpatient surgery  oncology  physical therapy and diagnostic centers including many in which physicians may have an ownership interest  as well as competing services rendered in physician offices 
some of our hospitals may develop outpatient facilities where necessary to compete effectively 
however  to the extent that other providers are successful in developing outpatient facilities  our market share for these services will likely decrease in the future 
moreover  many of our current hospitals attempt to attract patients from surrounding counties and communities  including communities in which a competing facility exists 
however  if our competitors are able to make capital improvements and expand services at their facilities  we may be unable to attract patients away from these facilities in the future 
if we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment  our ability to maintain and expand our markets will be adversely affected 
technological advances  potentially with respect to computer assisted tomography scanner cts  magnetic resonance imaging mris and positron emission tomography scanner pets equipment continue to evolve 
in addition  the manufacturers of such equipment often provide incentives to try to increase their sales  including providing favorable financing to higher credit risk organizations 
in an effort to compete  we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade our equipment as a result of technological improvements 
such equipment costs often range from million to million each  exclusive of any related construction costs 
physicians generally direct the majority of hospital admissions and services 
in addition  competition among hospitals and service providers including outpatient facilities and services performed in physician offices for patients has intensified in recent years 
we compete with other hospitals including larger tertiary care centers located in metropolitan areas 
we believe that the direction of the patient flow correlates directly to the level and intensity of such diagnostic equipment 
we are subject to governmental regulation  and may be subjected to allegations that we have failed to comply with governmental regulations which could result in sanctions that reduce our revenues and profitability 
all participants in the healthcare industry are required to comply with many laws and regulations at the federal  state and local government levels 
these laws and regulations require that hospitals meet various requirements  including those relating to the adequacy of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  billing and cost reports  payment for services and supplies  maintenance of adequate records  privacy  compliance with building codes and environmental protection 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we could suffer civil or criminal penalties  including the loss of our licenses to operate our hospitals and our ability to participate in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
significant media and public attention recently has focused on the hospital industry as a result of ongoing investigations related to referrals  physician recruiting practices  cost reporting and billing practices  laboratory and home healthcare services and physician ownership and joint ventures involving hospitals 
federal and state government agencies have announced heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts 
in addition  the oig which is responsible for investigating fraud and abuse activities in government programs and the us department of justice periodically establish enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse 
in january  the oig issued supplemental compliance program guidance for hospitals that focuses on hospital compliance risk areas 
some of the risk areas highlighted by the oig include correct outpatient procedure coding  revising admission and discharge policies to reflect current cms rules  submitting appropriate claims for supplemental payments such as pass through costs and outlier payments and a general discussion of the fraud and abuse risks related to financial relationships with referral sources 
in public statements  governmental authorities have taken positions on issues for which little official interpretation was previously available 
some of these positions appear to be inconsistent with common 
table of contents practices within the industry but have not previously been challenged 
moreover  some government investigations that have in the past been conducted under the civil provisions of federal law are now being conducted as criminal investigations under the medicare fraud and abuse laws 
the laws and regulations with which we must comply are complex and subject to change 
in the future  different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs and operating expenses 
finally  we are subject to various federal  state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment 
our healthcare operations generate medical waste  such as pharmaceuticals  biological materials and disposable medical instruments that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
our operations are also subject to various other environmental laws  rules and regulations 
environmental regulations also may apply when we renovate or refurbish hospitals  particularly older facilities 
we may be subjected to actions brought by the government under anti fraud and abuse provisions or by individuals on the government s behalf under the false claims act s qui tam or whistleblower provisions 
companies in the healthcare industry are subject to medicare and medicaid anti fraud and abuse provisions  known as the anti kickback statute 
as a company in the healthcare industry  we are subject to the anti kickback statute  which prohibits some business practices and relationships related to items or services reimbursable under medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs 
for example  the anti kickback statute prohibits healthcare service providers from paying or receiving remuneration to induce or arrange for the referral of patients or purchase of items or services covered by a federal or state healthcare program 
if regulatory authorities determine that any of our hospitals arrangements violate the anti kickback statute  we could be subject to liabilities under the social security act  including criminal penalties  civil monetary penalties  and or exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid or other federal healthcare programs  any of which could impair our ability to operate one or more of our hospitals profitably 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 
defendants found to be liable under the false claims act may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties ranging between  and  for each separate false claim 
there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the false claims act defines the term knowingly broadly 
although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the false claims act  submitting a claim with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity constitutes a knowing submission under the false claims act and  therefore  will give rise to liability 
in some cases  whistleblowers or the federal government have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes  such as the anti kickback statute and the stark law  have thereby submitted false claims under the false claims act 
in addition  a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court 
although we intend and will endeavor to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws  many of these laws are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied in ways that cannot be predicted 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to be in compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws 

table of contents we may be subject to liabilities because of malpractice and related legal claims brought against our hospitals 
if we become subject to these claims  we could be required to pay significant damages  which may not be covered by insurance 
we may be subject to medical malpractice lawsuits and other legal actions arising out of the operations of our owned and leased hospitals 
these actions may involve large claims and significant defense costs 
in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters  we may choose to negotiate a settlement 
amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  we maintain professional malpractice liability and general liability insurance coverage for these potential claims in amounts above our self insured retention level that we believe to be appropriate for our operations 
however  some of these claims could exceed the scope of the coverage in effect  or coverage of particular claims could be denied 
it is possible that successful claims against us that are within the self insured retention level amounts  when considered in the aggregate  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  financial condition or liquidity 
furthermore  insurance coverage in the future may not continue to be available at a cost allowing us to maintain adequate levels of insurance with acceptable self insured retention level amounts 
also  one or more of our insurance carriers may become insolvent and unable to fulfill its obligation to defend  pay or reimburse us when that obligation becomes due 
in addition  physicians using our hospitals may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms 
certificate of need laws and regulations regarding licenses  ownership and operation may impair our future expansion in some states 
some states require prior approval for the purchase  construction and expansion of healthcare facilities  based on the state s determination of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services 
nine states in which we currently operate hospitals require a certificate of need for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services  and for certain other planned activities 
we may not be able to obtain certificates of need required for expansion activities in the future 
in addition  all of the states in which we operate facilities require hospitals and most healthcare providers to maintain one or more licenses 
if we fail to obtain any required certificate of need or license  our ability to operate or expand operations in those states could be impaired 
in states without certificate of need laws  competing providers of healthcare services are able to expand and construct facilities without the need for significant regulatory approval 
in the ten states in which we operate that do not require certificates of need for the purchase  construction and expansion of healthcare facilities or services  competing healthcare providers face low barriers to entry and expansion 
if competing providers of healthcare services are able to purchase  construct or expand healthcare facilities without the need for regulatory approval  we may face decreased market share and revenues in those markets 
we are subject to significant corporate regulation as a public company and failure to comply with all applicable regulations could subject us to liability or negatively affect our stock price 
as a publicly traded company  we are subject to a significant body of regulation  including the sarbanes oxley act of while we have developed and instituted a corporate compliance program based on what we believe are the current best practices in corporate governance and continue to update this program in response to newly implemented or changing regulatory requirements  we cannot provide assurance that we are or will be in compliance with all potentially applicable corporate regulations 
for example  we cannot provide assurance that in the future our management will not find a material weakness in connection with its annual review of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act 
we also cannot provide assurance that we could correct any such weakness to allow our management to assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year in time to enable our independent registered public accounting firm to state that such assessment will have been fairly stated in our annual report on form k or state that we have maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year 
compliance with these regulations  and any changes in our internal control over financial reporting in response to our internal evaluations may be expensive and time consuming 
table of contents and may negatively impact our results of operations 
if we fail to comply with any of these regulations  we could be subject to a range of regulatory actions  fines or other sanctions or litigation 
if we must disclose any material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting  our stock price could decline 
our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control relevant to the markets in which we have hospitals  including weather conditions 
our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors  including physicians clinical decisions and availability  payor programs shifting to a more outpatient based environment  whether or not certain services are offered  seasonal and severe weather conditions  including the effects of extreme low temperatures  hurricanes and tornados  earthquakes  current local economic and demographic changes  the intensity and timing of yearly flu outbreaks and the judgment of the us centers for disease control on the strains of flu that may circulate in the united states 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and volume trends  and none of these factors will be within the control of our management 
different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
generally accepted accounting principles are complex  continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us  our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec 
such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances 
differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile  any significant decline may result in litigation 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
this may result in stockholder lawsuits  which could divert management s time away from operations and could result in higher legal fees and proxy costs 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  including issues associated with integration of the hospitals that we acquire  actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results  particularly if they differ from investors expectations  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  changes in government regulations as they relate to reimbursement and operational policies and procedures  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  changes in overall economic factors in our markets  and news reports relating to trends or events in our markets 
broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
as a result of the above factors  we could be subjected to potential activist stockholder lawsuits 
such lawsuits are time consuming and expensive 
among other things  such lawsuits divert management s time and attention from operations and can also cause distractions among employee stockholders  who are more long term focused 
such lawsuits also force us to incur substantial legal fees and proxy costs in defending our position

general 
we are  from time to time  subject to claims and suits arising in the ordinary course of business  including claims for damages for personal injuries  medical malpractice  breach of contracts  wrongful restriction of or interference with physicians staff privileges and employment related claims 
in certain of these actions  plaintiffs request payment for damages  including punitive damages that may not be covered by insurance 
we are currently not a party to any pending or threatened proceeding  which  in management s opinion  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
americans with disabilities act claims 
the americans with disabilities act  or the ada  generally requires that public accommodations be made accessible to disabled persons 
on january   a class action lawsuit was filed in the united states district court for the eastern district of tennessee against each of historic lifepoint s hospitals alleging non compliance with the accessibility guidelines of the ada 
the lawsuit does not seek any monetary damages  but seeks injunctive relief requiring facility modification  where necessary  to meet ada guidelines  in addition to attorneys fees and costs 
we are currently unable to estimate the costs that could be associated with modifying these facilities because these costs are negotiated and determined on a facility by facility basis and  therefore  have varied and will continue to vary significantly among facilities 
in january  the district court certified the class action and issued a scheduling order that requires the parties to complete discovery and inspection for approximately six facilities per year 
we are vigorously defending the lawsuit  recognizing our obligation to correct any deficiencies in order to comply with the ada 
as of december   the plaintiffs have conducted inspections at of our hospitals 
to date  the district court approved the settlement agreements between the parties relating to of our facilities 
we are now moving forward in implementing facility modifications in accordance with the terms of the settlement 
we have completed corrective work on three facilities for a cost of million 
we currently anticipate that the costs associated with ten other facilities that have court approved settlement agreements will range from million to million 
while the former province facilities  danville regional medical center and wythe county community hospital are not parties to this lawsuit  if these facilities become subject to the class action lawsuit  we may be required to expand significant capital expenditures at one or more of these facilities in order to comply with the ada  and our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected as a result 
the plaintiff in this lawsuit has represented to the court that it will amend the lawsuit to add our acquired facilities and dismiss the divested facilities 
noncompliance with the requirements of the ada could result in the imposition of fines against us by the federal government  or the award of damages from us to individuals

to minimum revenue guarantees granted to a business or its owners fsp fin  which served as an amendment to fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  by adding minimum revenue guarantees to the list of example contracts to which fin applies 
under fsp fin  a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
one example cited in fsp fin involves a guarantee provided by a healthcare entity to a non employed physician in order to recruit such physician to move to the entity s geographical area and establish a private practice 
in the example  the healthcare entity also agreed to make payments to the relocated physician if the gross revenue or gross receipts generated by the physician s new practice during a specified time period did not equal or exceed predetermined monetary thresholds 
because this example in fsp fin is similar to certain of our physician recruiting commitments  we believe it falls under the accounting guidance of fsp fin fsp fin was effective for new physician minimum revenue guarantees issued or modified on or after january  we adopted fsp fin effective january  for physician minimum revenue guarantees issued before january   we expensed the advances as they were paid to the physicians  which were typically over a period of one year 
under fsp fin  we record a contract based intangible asset and related guarantee liability for new physician minimum revenue guarantees entered into after january  and amortize the contract based intangible asset to physician recruiting expense over the period of the physician contract  which is typically five years

the province business combination in april provided a unique opportunity for us to acquire hospitals in non urban communities  while diversifying our economic and geographic base 
additionally  our july  acquisition of two of the hospitals from hca and our other hospital acquisitions fit into our plan of pursuing a strategy of acquiring hospitals that are the sole or a significant market provider of healthcare services in their communities 
in evaluating a hospital for acquisition  we focus on a variety of factors 
one factor we consider is the number of patients that are traveling outside of the community for healthcare services 
another factor we consider is the hospital s prior operating history and our ability to implement new healthcare services 
in addition  we review the local demographics and expected future trends 
upon acquiring a facility  we quickly work to integrate the hospital into our operating practices 
please refer to the acquisitions section in part i  item business for a table of our hospital acquisitions since our inception in please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further discussion of acquisitions that we made in  and 
table of contents in connection with the finalization of the purchase price allocations of both danville regional medical center drmc and province  we recognized a reduction in depreciation expense of approximately million million net of income taxes  or per diluted share during this decreased depreciation expense was the result of lower fair values of certain property and equipment established by the third party valuation firm than originally anticipated in the preliminary purchase price allocations 
havasu joint venture effective september   we formed a joint venture with certain physicians in the lake havasu city area 
we contributed cash and substantially all of the assets used in the operations of havasu regional medical center  excluding real estate and home health assets  and the physicians contributed substantially all the assets of havasu surgery center  an outpatient surgical center 
we retain an approximately equity interest in the joint venture 
business combination with province healthcare company on april   we completed the business combination with province healthcare company 
as a result of the business combination  each of historic lifepoint and province is now a wholly owned subsidiary of lifepoint hospitals  inc  a new public company formed in connection with the business combination 
we believe that the province business combination has provided and will continue to provide efficiencies for our operations and enhance our ability to compete effectively 
as a result of the province business combination and subsequent acquisitions  we are more geographically and financially diversified in our asset base  increasing our operations from nine states to states 
please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information regarding the province business combination 
our results of operations include the operations of the former hospitals of province beginning april  discontinued operations from time to time  we may evaluate our facilities and sell assets which we believe may no longer fit with our long term strategy for various reasons 
in connection with the acquisition of four facilities from hca  effective july   we entered into a plan to divest two hospitals  st 
joseph s hospital located in parkersburg  west virginia  and saint francis hospital located in charleston  west virginia 
we sold saint francis hospital effective january   and anticipate selling st 
joseph s hospital by mid during the second quarter of  subsequent to the province business combination  we committed to a plan to divest three hospitals acquired from province 
these three hospitals were medical center of southern indiana located in charlestown  indiana  ashland regional medical center located in ashland  pennsylvania  and palo verde hospital located in blythe  california 
we divested palo verde hospital on january  by terminating our lease of that hospital and returning the hospital to the hospital district of palo verde 
we completed the sale of both medical center of southern indiana and ashland regional medical center to saint catherine healthcare effective may  on march   we sold smith county memorial hospital to sumner regional health system 
on march   we sold bartow memorial hospital to health management associates  inc please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for more information on our discontinued operations 

table of contents the following table reflects our summarized operating results of discontinued operations for the years presented in millions  except per share amounts revenues income loss from discontinued operations impairment of assets gain loss on sale of hospitals income loss from discontinued operations diluted earnings loss per share from discontinued operations key challenges we anticipate increasing our revenues and profitability on both a long term and short term basis 
however  we have the following internal and external key challenges to overcome increases in provision for doubtful accounts 
we have experienced an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts during recent years 
these increases were the result of an increased number of uninsured patients and an increase in co payments and deductibles from healthcare plan design changes 
these changes increase collection costs and reduce overall cash collections 
our provision for doubtful accounts on a consolidated basis was as follows for the periods presented in millions provision for doubtful accounts first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter our revenues decrease when we write off patient accounts identified as charity and indigent care 
our hospitals write off a portion of a patient s account upon the determination that the patient qualifies under the hospital s charity indigent care policy 
in the event that a patient account was previously classified as self pay when the determination of charity indigent status is made  a corresponding reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts may occur 
the following table reflects our consolidated charity and indigent care write offs for the periods presented in millions charity and indigent care write offs first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter 
table of contents the provision for doubtful accounts  as well as charity and indigent care write offs  relate primarily to self pay revenues 
the following table reflects our quarterly consolidated self pay revenues  net of charity and indigent care write offs  for the periods presented in millions self pay revenues first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter the following table shows our consolidated revenue days outstanding reflected in our consolidated net accounts receivable as of the dates indicated revenue days outstanding in accounts receivable march june september december the following table shows our adjusted consolidated revenue days outstanding reflected in our consolidated net accounts receivable as of the dates indicated 
revenues are adjusted by subtracting the provision for doubtful accounts during the periods indicated 
adjusted revenue days outstanding in accounts receivable march june september december the approximate percentages of billed hospital receivables which is a component of total accounts receivable are summarized as follows december  december  insured receivables uninsured receivables including co payments and deductibles 
table of contents the approximate percentages of billed hospital receivables in summarized aging categories are as follows december  december  to days to days over days we continue to implement a number of operating strategies as they relate to cash collections 
however  if the trend of increasing self pay revenues continues  our results of operations and financial position in the future could be materially adversely affected 
physician recruitment and retention 
recruiting and retaining both primary care physicians and specialists for our non urban communities is a key to increasing revenues  patient volumes and the value that the communities place on our hospitals 
the medical staffs at our hospitals are typically small and our revenues are negatively affected by the loss of physicians 
our management believes that continuing to add specialists should help our hospitals increase volumes by offering new services 
during  we recruited new admitting physicians and spent million in cash on physician recruitment  including physician minimum revenue guarantee payments 
we plan to recruit approximately new admitting physicians during a summary of activity related to our admitting physicians during is as follows admitting physicians december  recruited departed additions from two hca hospitals acquired effective july  december  substantial indebtedness 
our consolidated debt was  million as of december   and we incurred million of net interest expense during we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective as of november  with a maturity date of may  the interest rate swap converts a portion of our indebtedness to a fixed interest rate with a decreasing notional amount starting at million at an annual fixed rate of 
our substantial indebtedness increases our cost of capital  decreases our net income and reduces the amount of funds available for operations  capital expenditures and future acquisitions 
we are in compliance with our financial debt covenants as of december  and believe we will be in compliance with them throughout it is not our intent to maintain large cash balances  and we will focus on reducing our indebtedness during medicare changes 
we have experienced changes with respect to governmental reimbursement that are affecting our growth 
effective october   cms expanded the post acute transfer policy from diagnosis related groups drgs to drgs resulting in an approximate million reduction in our medicare inpatient pps payments for ffy cms further expanded the list to drgs during ffy  however we do not anticipate any material increase in payment reductions for on february   the dra was signed into law 
this law includes measures related to quality reporting and pay for performance  the inpatient rehabilitation facility rule and medicaid cuts 
part i  item business  sources of revenue in this report contains a detailed discussion of provisions that affect our medicare reimbursement 
integration of acquired hospitals 
during and  we acquired numerous hospitals in several transactions 
the process of integrating the operations of these hospitals could cause an interruption of  
table of contents or loss of momentum in  the activities of our business 
however  we are dedicated to devoting significant management attention and resources to integrating the business practices and operations of our recently acquired hospitals 
shortage of clinical personnel and increased contract labor usage 
in recent years  many hospitals  including some of the hospitals we own  have encountered difficulty in recruiting and retaining nursing and certain medical technicians 
when we are unable to staff our nursing and certain medical technician positions  we are required to use contract labor to ensure adequate patient care 
contract labor generally costs more per hour than employed labor 
we have adopted a number of human resources strategies in an attempt to improve our ability to recruit and retain nursing and certain medical technicians 
however  we expect that staffing issues related to nurses and certain medical technicians will continue in the future 
challenges in professional and general liability costs 
professional and general liability costs remain a challenge to us  and we expect this pressure to continue in the future 
in recent years  we have incurred favorable loss experience  as reflected in our external actuarial reports 
we have implemented enhanced risk management processes for monitoring professional and general liability claims and managing in high risk areas 
increases in supply costs 
during the past few years  we have experienced an increase in supply costs as a percentage of revenues  especially in the areas of pharmaceutical  orthopedic  oncology and cardiac supplies 
we participate in a group purchasing organization in an attempt to achieve lower supply costs from our vendors 
because of the fixed reimbursement nature of most governmental and commercial payor arrangements  we may not be able to recover supply cost increases through increased revenues 
increases in information technology costs and costs of integration 
our acquisition activity requires transitions from  and the integration of  various information systems that are used by hospitals we acquire 
we rely heavily on hca it for information systems integration pursuant to our contractual arrangement for information technology services 
recently  the number of hospitals we operated increased significantly 
this resulted in significant increases in our information technology costs 
summary each of our challenges are intensified by our inability to control related trends and the associated risks 
therefore  our actual results may differ from our expectations 
to maintain or improve operating margins in the future  we must  among other things  increase patient volumes through physician recruiting  relationships and retention while controlling the costs of providing services 
revenue sources our hospitals generate revenues by providing healthcare services to our patients 
the majority of these healthcare services are directed by physicians 
we are paid for these healthcare services from a number of different sources  depending upon the patient s medical insurance coverage 
primarily  we are paid by governmental medicare and medicaid programs  commercial insurance  including managed care organizations  and directly by the patient 
the amounts we are paid for providing healthcare services to our patients vary depending upon the payor 
governmental payors generally pay significantly less than the hospital s customary charges for the services provided 
please refer to part i  item business  sources of revenue for a detailed discussion of our revenue sources 
revenues from governmental payors  such as medicare and medicaid  are controlled by complex rules and regulations that stipulate the amount a hospital is paid for providing healthcare services 
our compliance with these rules and regulations requires an extensive effort to ensure we remain eligible to participate in these governmental programs 
in addition  these rules and regulations are subject to frequent changes as a result of legislative and administrative action on both the federal and the state levels 
for these reasons  revenues from governmental programs change frequently and require us to monitor regularly the environment in which these governmental programs operate 

table of contents revenues from hmos  ppos and other private insurers are subject to contracts and other arrangements that require us to discount the amounts we customarily charge for healthcare services 
these discounted arrangements often limit our ability to increase charges in response to increasing costs 
we actively negotiate with these payors to seek to maintain or increase the pricing of our healthcare services 
insured patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and the amounts received from commercial insurance payors 
however  insured patients are responsible for payments not covered by insurance  such as exclusions  deductibles and co payments 
self pay revenues are primarily generated through the treatment of uninsured patients 
our hospitals experienced an increase in self pay revenues during the past few years 

table of contents critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been made could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm  and they both have reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to our critical accounting estimates 
the table of critical accounting estimates is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies that require estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and our financial condition 
the table that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flows 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the primary uncertainty lies with uninsured patient receivables and deductibles  co payments or other amounts due from individual patients 
the largest component of bad debts in our patient accounts receivable relates to accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts or self pay accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
in general  we attempt to collect deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to the time of service for non emergency care 
if we do not collect these patient responsibility accounts prior to the delivery of care  the accounts are handled through our billing and collections processes 
we verify each patient s insurance coverage as early as possible if self pay revenues during were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately million or diluted earnings per share of 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate uncollectible patient accounts that are highly uncertain and requires a high degree of judgment 
our estimates may be impacted by changes in regional economic conditions  business office operations  payor mix and trends in federal or state governmental healthcare coverage 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts continued our allowance for doubtful accounts  included in our balance sheets as of december was as follows in millions  and before a scheduled admission or procedure  including with respect to eligibility  benefits and authorization pre certification requirements  in order to notify patients of the amounts for which they will be responsible 
we attempt to verify insurance coverage within a reasonable amount of time for all emergency room visits and urgent admissions in compliance with the emergency medical treatment and active labor act 
in general  we perform the following steps in collecting accounts receivable a significant increase in our provision for doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenues would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and future access to capital our provision for doubtful accounts  included in our results of operations  was as follows in millions if possible  cash collection of deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to or at the time service is provided  billing and follow up with third party payors   and collection calls  utilization of collection agencies  and if collection efforts are unsuccessful  write off of the accounts 
our policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed  which is typically no longer than one year after the date of discharge of the patient 
patient responsibility accounts represent the majority of our write offs 
all of our hospitals retain third party collection agencies for billing and collection of delinquent accounts 
at most of our hospitals  more than one collection agency is used 
table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts continued to promote competition and improve performance results 
the selection of collection agencies and the timing of referral of an account to a collection agency vary among hospitals 
generally  we do not write off accounts prior to utilizing the services of a collection agency 
once collection efforts have proven unsuccessful  an account is written off from our patient accounting system against the allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts utilizing a number of analytical tools and benchmarks 
no single statistic or measurement alone determines the adequacy of the allowance 
as it relates to our recently acquired hospitals  we monitor trends in revenues and cash collections on a monthly basis for to months subsequent to the acquisition on a facility by facility basis 
as it relates to our core hospitals  which we refer to as same hospital  we monitor the revenue trends by payor classification on a month by month basis along with the composition of our accounts receivable agings 
this review is focused primarily on trends in self pay revenues  accounts receivable  co payment receivables and historic payment patterns 
in addition  we analyze other factors such as revenue days in accounts receivable and we review admissions and charges by physicians  primarily focusing on recently recruited physicians

this adjustment constituted a change in the estimation process from the former province critical accounting estimate and is reflected as transaction costs in our consolidated statement of operations for the adjustment is the result of our review of province s patient accounts receivable and the application of the same assumptions and processes we use 
revenue recognition allowance for contractual discounts we recognize revenues in the period in which services are provided 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and other third party payors such as hmos  ppos and other private insurers  are generally less than our established billing rates 
accordingly  our gross revenues and accounts receivable are reduced to net realizable value through an allowance for contractual discounts 
approximately of our revenues during relate to discounted charges 
revenues are recorded at estimated net amounts due from patients  third party payors and others for healthcare services provided 
we utilize multiple patient accounting systems 
therefore  estimates for contractual allowances are calculated using computerized and manual processes depending on the type of payor involved and the patient accounting system used by each of our hospitals 
in certain hospitals  the contractual allowances are calculated by a computerized system based on payment terms for each payor 
in other hospitals  the contractual allowances are determined manually using historical collections for each type of payor 
for all hospitals  certain manual estimates are used in calculating contractual allowances based on 
table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis revenue recognition allowance for contractual discounts continued the sources of these revenues were as follows as a percentage of total revenues historical collections from payors that are not significant or have not entered into a contract with us 
all contractual adjustments regardless of type of payor or method of calculation are reviewed and compared to actual experience 
medicare  medicaid  and managed care 
governmental payors the majority of services performed on medicare and medicaid patients are reimbursed at predetermined reimbursement rates 
the differences between the established billing rates ie  gross charges and the predetermined reimbursement rates are recorded as contractual discounts and deducted from gross charges 
under this prospective reimbursement system  there is no adjustment or settlement of the difference between the actual cost to provide the service and the predetermined reimbursement rates 
discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues  which were more prevalent in periods before  are estimated based on historical and current factors and are adjusted in future periods when settlements of filed cost reports are received 
final settlements under these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third party intermediaries  which can take several years to resolve completely 
governmental payors because the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to change  the estimates of contractual discounts we record could change by material amounts 
adjustments related to final settlements increased our revenues by the following amounts in millions  and managed care managed care accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients

for most managed care plans  estimated contractual allowances are adjusted to actual contractual allowances as cash is received and claims are reconciled 
we evaluate the following criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowance percentages each month historical contractual allowance trends based on actual claims paid by managed care payors  review of contractual allowance information reflecting current contract terms  consideration and analysis of changes in payor mix reimbursement levels  and other issues that may impact contractual allowances 
our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately million

accounting for stock based compensation we issue stock options and other stock based awards to our key employees and directors under various stockholder approved stock based compensation plans 
we currently have four types of stock based awards outstanding under these plans stock options  nonvested stock  restricted stock units  and deferred stock units 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based employee compensation plans under the measurement and recognition provisions of apb no 
 as permitted by sfas no 
we did not record any stock based employee compensation expense for options granted under our stock based incentive plans prior to january   as all options granted under those plans had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we also did not record any compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan prior to january   as the purchase price of the stock was not less than of the lower of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning of each offering period or at the end of each purchase period 
in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
 prior to january   we disclosed our pro forma net income or loss and pro forma net income or loss per in january  we changed from the black scholes merton option valuation model bsm to a lattice based option valuation model  the hull white ii valuation model hw ii 
we prefer the hw ii over the bsm because the hw ii considers characteristics of fair value option pricing  such as an option s contractual term and the probability of exercise before the end of the contractual term  that are not available under the bsm 
in addition  the complications surrounding the expected term of an option are material  as clarified by the sec s focus on the matter in sab given the reasonably large pool of our unexercised options  we believe a lattice model that specifically addresses this fact and models a full term of exercises is the most appropriate and reliable means of valuing our stock options 
we used a third party to assist in developing the assumptions used in estimating the fair values of stock options granted during we estimated the fair value of stock options granted during using the hw ii lattice option valuation model and a single option award approach 
we are amortizing the fair value on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are the vesting the fair value calculations of our stock option grants are affected by assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based upon the facts and circumstances at the time of grant

effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no

under that transition method  compensation expense that we recognize beginning on that date includes i compensation expense for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no

we determine the fair value of nonvested stock grants based on the closing price of our common stock on the grant date

r  a company should aggregate individual awards into relatively homogeneous groups with respect to exercise and post vesting employment behaviors for the purpose of refining the expected term assumption  regardless of the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value 
in addition  sab clarifies that a company may generally make a reasonable fair value estimate with as few as one or two groupings 
we have stratified our employee population into two groups i insiders  who are the section filers under sec rules  and ii non insiders  who are the rest of the employee 
table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis accounting for stock based compensation continued our stock based compensation  included in our results of operations  was as follows in millions  and population 
we derived this stratification based on the analysis of our historical exercise patterns  excluding certain extraordinary events 
expected volatility volatility is a measure of the tendency of investment returns to vary around a long term average rate 
historical volatility is still an appropriate starting point for setting this assumption under sfas no 
r 
according to sfas no 
r  companies should also consider how future experience may differ from the past 
this may require using other factors to adjust historical volatility  such as implied volatility  peer group volatility and the range and mean reversion of volatility estimates over various historical periods 
sfas no 
r and sab acknowledge that there is likely to be a range of reasonable estimates for volatility 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires that if a best estimate cannot be made  management should use the mid point in the range of reasonable estimates for volatility 
effective january  we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options on our common stock  consistent with sfas no 
r and sab risk free interest rate lattice models require risk free interest rates for all potential times of exercise obtained by using a grant date yield curve 
a lattice 
table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis accounting for stock based compensation continued model would therefore require the yield curve for the entire time period during which employees might exercise their options 
we base the risk free rate on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on us treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
expected dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero 
pre vesting forfeitures pre vesting forfeitures do not affect the fair value calculation  but they affect the expense calculation 
sfas no 
r requires us to estimate pre vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we have used historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
for purposes of calculating pro forma information under sfas no 
for periods prior to january   we also used an estimated forfeiture rate 
post vesting cancellations post vesting cancellations include vested options that are cancelled  exercised or expire unexercised

r calls for an extinguishment calculation  dependent upon how long a granted option remains outstanding before it is fully extinguished

 goodwill and other intangible assets  and test goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach 
we are required to test for impairment at least annually  absent some triggering event that would accelerate an impairment assessment 
on an ongoing basis  absent any impairment indicators  we perform our goodwill impairment testing as of october of each year 
we determine fair value using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow and market multiple analyses 
these types of analyses require us to make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows  industry economic factors and the we performed our annual testing for goodwill impairment as of october   and using the methodology described here  and determined that no goodwill impairment existed

the purchase price of acquisitions are allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their respective fair values and subject to change during the twelve month period subsequent to the acquisition date 
we engage independent third party valuation firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including projections of future events and operating performance

professional and general liability claims we are subject to potential medical malpractice lawsuits and other claims 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  we maintained insurance for individual malpractice claims exceeding a self insured retention amount 
for  our self insured retention level was million 
for and  we increased our self insured retention levels to million and million  respectively 
we maintained self insured retention at million for our sole facility located in florida 
additionally  certain of our facilities operate in states having state specific medical malpractice programs 
we have commercial insurance policies for claims in excess of  in the following states colorado  indiana  and kansas 
the state program in louisiana limits our medical malpractice retention to  each year  we obtain quotes from various malpractice insurers with respect to the cost of obtaining medical malpractice insurance coverage 
we compare these quotes to our most recent actuarially determined estimates of losses at various self insured retention levels 
accordingly  our reserves for professional and general liability claims are based upon independent actuarial calculations  which consider historical claims data  demographic considerations  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions in the determination of reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are discounted to present value using a discount rate 
during the first quarter of  we revised our reserve estimation process by obtaining independent actuarial calculations every quarter  rather than twice each year  from two actuarial firms 
our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will be significantly affected if current and future claims differ from historical trends 
while we monitor reported claims closely and consider potential outcomes as estimated by our independent actuaries when determining our professional and general liability reserves  the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes complicates the estimation process 
in addition  certain states have passed varying forms of tort reform which attempt to limit the amount of actuarial calculations include a large number of variables that may significantly impact the estimate of ultimate losses that are recorded during a reporting period 
professional judgment is used by each actuary in determining their loss estimates by selecting factors that are considered appropriate by the actuary for our specific circumstances 
changes in assumptions used by our independent actuaries with respect to demographics and geography  industry trends  development patterns and judgmental selection of other factors may impact our recorded reserve levels and our results of operations 
we derive our estimates for financial reporting purposes by using a mathematical average of our actuarial results 
changes in our initial estimates of professional and general liability claims are non cash charges and accordingly  there would be no material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 

table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis professional and general liability claims continued changes in insurance costs affect the self insurance retention level we choose each year

the loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future based upon updated facts and circumstances 
medical malpractice awards 
if such laws are passed in the states where our hospitals are located  our loss estimates could decrease 
we use the valuations of two actuaries and average their results in determining our recorded reserve levels on a quarterly basis 
this averaging process results in a refined estimation approach that we believe produces a more reliable estimate of ultimate losses 
we currently receive actuarial calculations each quarter from two separate actuarial firms 
province did not use the services of either of these actuarial firms 
upon conforming the hospitals that we acquired from province to our methodology by obtaining valuations from each of our actuarial firms and averaging the results  the reserves for professional and general liability claims were increased by million

accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets generally represent items that will result in a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance  we must include an expense as part of the income tax provision in our results of operations 
our deferred tax asset balances in our consolidated balance sheets as of december for the following years were as follows in millions  and the first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance 
we then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 
the second step is to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
we will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities related to the jurisdiction identified in step one of the analysis 
in certain cases  we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future our deferred tax liabilities exceeded our deferred tax assets by million as of december   excluding the impact of valuation allowances 
historically  we have produced federal taxable income 
therefore  we believe that the likelihood of our not realizing the federal tax benefit of our deferred tax assets is remote 
however  we do have subsidiaries with a history of tax losses in certain state jurisdictions and  based upon those historical tax losses  we assumed that the subsidiaries would not be profitable in the future for those state s tax purposes 
if our assertion regarding the future profitability of those subsidiaries were incorrect  then our deferred tax assets would be understated by the amount of the valuation allowance of million at december  
table of contents balance sheet or income statement caption nature of critical estimate item assumptions approach used sensitivity analysis accounting for income taxes continued our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets as of december for the following years were as follows in millions  and in addition  significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of certain tax related contingencies 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to tax contingencies and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for income taxes in our results of operations based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as progress of a tax audit  development of industry related examination issues  as well as legislative  regulatory or judicial developments 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and resolved 
taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities 
in assessing tax contingencies  we identify tax issues that we believe may be challenged upon examination by the taxing authorities 
we also assess the likelihood of sustaining tax benefits associated with tax planning strategies and reduce tax benefits based on management s judgment regarding such likelihood 
we compute the tax and related interest on each contingency 
we then determine the amount of loss  or reduction in tax benefits based upon the foregoing and reflect such amount as a component of the provision for income taxes in the reporting period 
during each reporting period  we assess the facts and circumstances related to recorded tax contingencies 
if tax contingencies are no longer deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances  the contingency is reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the current period 
the irs may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies 
if the irs were to propose and sustain assessments equal to of our taxable income for  we would incur million of additional tax payments for plus applicable penalties and interest

our computation of free operating cash flow consists of net cash flow provided by continuing operations less cash flows used for purchases of property and equipment 
we believe that free operating cash flow is useful to investors and management as a measure of the ability of our business to generate cash and is also utilized for debt repayments 
computations of free operating cash flow may differ from company to company 
therefore  free operating cash flow should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in the report

table of contents debt ratings our debt is rated by three credit rating agencies designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations by the sec moody s investors service  inc moody s  standard poor s rating services  s p  and fitch ratings 
a credit rating reflects an assessment by the rating agency of the credit risk associated with particular securities we issue  based on information provided by us and other sources 
credit ratings are not recommendations to buy  sell or hold securities and are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency 
each rating agency may have different criteria for evaluating company risk and  therefore  ratings should be evaluated independently for each rating agency 
lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to capital markets 
our recent ratings are primarily a reflection of the rating agencies concern regarding our higher leverage  increased activity in acquisitions and our ability to pay down our outstanding debt

we have large projects in process at a number of our facilities 
we are reconfiguring some of our hospitals to more effectively accommodate patient services and restructuring existing surgical capacity in some of our hospitals to permit additional patient volume and a greater variety of services 
at december   we had projects under construction with an estimated additional cost to complete and equip of approximately million 
we anticipate that these projects will be completed over the next two years 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a discussion of required capital expenditures for certain facilities 
we anticipate funding these expenditures through cash provided by operating activities  available cash and borrowings available under our credit arrangements 
our business strategy contemplates the selective acquisition of additional hospitals and other healthcare service providers  and we regularly review these potential acquisitions 
these acquisitions may  however  require additional financing 
we regularly evaluate opportunities to sell additional equity or debt securities  obtain credit facilities from lenders or restructure our long term debt or equity for strategic reasons or to

our board of directors will evaluate our future earnings  results of operations  financial condition and capital requirements in determining whether to declare or pay cash dividends 
delaware law prohibits us from paying any dividends unless we have capital surplus or net profits available for this purpose 
in addition  our credit facilities impose restrictions on our ability to pay dividends 
we believe that cash flows from operations  amounts available under our credit facility and our anticipated access to capital markets are sufficient to fund the purchase prices for any potential acquisitions  meet expected liquidity needs  including repayment of our debt obligations  planned capital expenditures and other expected operating needs over the next three years 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements contractual obligations we have various contractual obligations  which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements

we used the and effective interest rates at december  for our  million outstanding term b loans and million outstanding revolving credit loans  respectively  to estimate interest payments on these variable rate debt instruments 
our interest rate swap agreement requires us to make quarterly interest payments at an annual fixed rate of while the counterparty is obligated to make quarterly floating payments to us based on the three month libo rate on a decreasing notional amount 
our calculation for long term debt obligations includes an estimate for the net result of these payments between us and the counterparty using the difference between our required annual fixed rate of and the three month libo rate in effect as of december  of based on the effective notional amounts for the indicated period 
holders of our million outstanding debentures may require us to purchase for cash some or all of the debentures on february   february   and february  for purposes of the above table  we assumed that our debentures would be outstanding during its entire term  which ends on august  b this reflects our future minimum operating lease payments

we used a annual rate increase as the estimated consumer price index increase for the contract period 
these fees will increase if we acquire additional hospitals and use hca it for information system conversion services at the acquired hospitals 
f we had projects under construction with an estimated additional cost to complete and equip of approximately million as of december  because we can terminate substantially all of the related construction contracts at any time without paying a termination fee  these costs are excluded from the above table except for amounts contractually committed by us 
in addition  as discussed in part i  item legal proceedings of this report  we may be required to make significant expenditures in order to bring our facilities into compliance with the ada 
we are currently unable to estimate the costs that could be associated with modifying our facilities because these costs are negotiated and determined on a facility by facility basis and  therefore  have varied and will continue to vary significantly among facilities 
g in consideration for a physician relocating to one of the communities in which our hospitals are located and agreeing to engage in private practice for the benefit of the respective community  we may advance certain amounts of money to a physician  normally over a period of one year  to assist in establishing the physician s practice

fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  fin provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions of fin are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year

segment reporting we operate in one reportable operating segment healthcare services 
sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
 establishes standards for the 
table of contents way that public business enterprises report information about operating segments in annual consolidated financial statements 
although we have five operating divisions  under the aggregation criteria set forth in sfas no 
 we only operate in one reportable operating segment healthcare services 
under sfas no 
 two or more operating segments may be aggregated into a single operating segment for financial reporting purposes if aggregation is consistent with the objective and basic principles of sfas no 
 if the segments have similar economic characteristics  and if the segments are similar in each of the following areas the nature of the products and services  the nature of the production processes  the type or class of customer for their products and services  the methods used to distribute their products or provide their services  and if applicable  the nature of the regulatory environment  for example  banking  insurance  or public utilities 
we meet each of the aggregation criteria for the following reasons the treatment of patients in a hospital setting is the only material source of revenues for each of our operating divisions  the healthcare services provided by each of our operating divisions are generally the same  the healthcare services provided by each of our operating divisions are generally provided to similar types of patients  which are patients in a hospital setting  the healthcare services are primarily provided by the direction of affiliated or employed physicians and by the nurses  lab technicians and others employed or contracted at each of our hospitals  and the healthcare regulatory environment is generally similar for each of our operating divisions 
because we meet each of the criteria set forth above and each of our operating divisions has similar economic characteristics  our management aggregates our results of operations in one reportable operating segment 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages in marketplaces occur 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
private insurers pass along their rising costs in the form of lower reimbursement to us 
our ability to pass on these increased costs in increased rates is limited because of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and the fact that the majority of our revenues are fee based 
accordingly  inflationary pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion relates to our exposure to market risk based on changes in interest rates outstanding debt we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
we entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective november   with a maturity date of may  to manage our exposure to these fluctuations 
the interest rate swap converts a portion of our indebtedness to a fixed rate with a decreasing notional amount starting at million at an annual fixed rate of 
the notional amount of the swap agreement represents a balance used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and is not an asset or liability 
any market risk or opportunity associated with this swap agreement is offset by the opposite market 
table of contents impact on the related debt 
our credit risk related to this agreement is low because the swap agreement is with a creditworthy financial institution 
as of december   we had outstanding debt of  million  or  million  of which was subject to variable rates of interest 
as of december   the fair value of our outstanding variable rate debt approximates its carrying value and the fair value of our million debentures was approximately million  based on the quoted market prices at december  based on a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates  the potential annualized decrease in our future pre tax earnings would be approximately million as of december  the estimated change to our interest expense is determined considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and debt balances 
these analyses do not consider the effects  if any  of the potential changes in our credit ratings or the overall level of economic activity 
further  in the event of a change of significant magnitude  our management would expect to take actions intended to further mitigate our exposure to such change 
cash balances certain of our outstanding cash balances are invested overnight with high credit quality financial institutions 
we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash at december  as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   if any  is low
