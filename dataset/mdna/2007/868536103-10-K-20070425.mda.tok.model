item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview supervalu is one of the largest grocery companies in the united states 
the company operates in two segments of the grocery industry  retail food stores and supply chain services  which includes food distribution and related logistics support services 
at february   we conducted our retail operations through a total of  stores of which are licensed locations 
store counts are adjusted for the planned sale of scott s stores and the sale or closure of jewel osco stores in the milwaukee area 
principal formats include combination stores defined as food and drug  food stores and limited assortment food stores 
our supply chain services operations network spans states and we serve as primary grocery supplier to approximately  stores  in addition to our own regional banner store network  as well as serving as secondary grocery supplier to approximately stores

the albertsons acquisition on june  the acquisition date  the company acquired new albertson s  inc new albertsons consisting of the core supermarket businesses the acquired operations formerly owned by albertson s  inc albertsons operating under the banners of acme markets  bristol farms  jewel osco  shaw s supermarkets  star market  the albertsons banner in the intermountain  northwest and southern california regions  the related in store pharmacies under the osco and sav on banners  distribution centers  certain regional offices and certain corporate offices in boise  idaho  glendale  arizona and salt lake city  utah the acquisition 
the acquisition greatly increased the size of the company 
the acquisition also greatly increased the relative size of the company s retail food segment compared to its supply chain services segment 
in fiscal  percent of our net sales and percent of our operating earnings came from our retail food segment  compared to percent and percent  respectively  in fiscal in fiscal  we expect the company s retail food segment will contribute approximately percent of the company s net sales 
the industry and the economic environment the retail grocery industry can be characterized as one of continued consolidation and rationalization  with the acquisition being one of the largest acquisitions in the history of the industry 
grocery retailers also continue to compete against an increasing number of competitive formats that are adding square footage devoted to food and groceries such as supercenters  club stores  mass merchandisers  dollar stores  drug stores and other alternate formats 
the grocery industry is also affected by the general economic environment and its impact on consumer spending behavior 
we would characterize fiscal as a year with continued economic growth  continued high fuel 
table of contents prices and modest product cost inflation 
for fiscal  we expect consumer spending will be impacted by high fuel prices  continued food inflation and the soft housing market 
the company s plan we believe we can be successful against this industry backdrop with our regional retail formats that focus on local execution  merchandising and consumer knowledge 
in addition  our operations will benefit from our efficient and low cost supply chain and new economies of scale as we leverage our retail food and supply chain services operations 
we plan to expand regional retail banner square footage through selective new store growth in key markets where we have significant market share 
the acquisition has significantly expanded our retail presence and the number of stores we operate 
save a lot  our limited assortment format  currently operates in states 
in addition  we will supplement regional retail store growth with continued focus on remodel activities 
given the life cycle maturity of our supply chain services business with its inherent attrition rate  future growth in food distribution will be modest and primarily achieved through serving new independent customers  net growth from existing customers and further consolidation opportunities

critical accounting policies the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant accounting policies are discussed in the summary of significant accounting policies in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more subjective or complex judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
vendor funds the company receives funds from many of the vendors whose products the company buys for resale in its stores 
these vendor funds are provided to increase the sell through of the related products 
the company receives vendor funds for a variety of merchandising activities placement of the vendors products in the company s advertising  display of the vendors products in prominent locations in the company s stores  introduction of new products into the company s distribution system and retail stores  exclusivity rights in certain categories that have slower turning products  and to compensate for temporary price reductions offered to customers on products held for sale at retail stores 
the company also receives vendor funds for buying activities such as volume commitment rebates  credits for purchasing products in advance of their need and cash discounts for the early payment of merchandise purchases 
as of february   the terms of the company s vendor funds arrangements varied in length from primarily short term arrangements that are to be completed within a quarter to long term arrangements that are primarily expected to be completed within three years 
the company recognizes vendor funds for merchandising activities as a reduction of cost of sales when the related products are sold in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
substantially all of the company s inventory consists of finished goods 
approximately percent and percent of the company s inventories are valued using the last in  first out lifo method for fiscal and  respectively 
the first in  first out method fifo is used to determine cost for some of the remaining highly perishable inventories 
if the fifo method had been used to determine cost of inventories for which the lifo method is used  the company s inventories would have been higher by approximately at february  and at february  the company uses a combination of the retail inventory method rim and replacement cost method to determine the cost of its inventory 
the rim valuation of inventories is at cost and the gross margins are 
table of contents calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the current retail value of inventories 
the replacement cost method utilizes the most current unit purchase cost to calculate the value of inventories 
during fiscal  and  inventory quantities in certain lifo layers were reduced 
these reductions resulted in a liquidation of lifo inventory quantities carried at lower costs prevailing in prior years as compared with the cost of fiscal  and purchases 
as a result  cost of sales decreased by  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
this increased net earnings per diluted share by  and in  and  respectively 
the company evaluates inventory shortages throughout the year based on actual physical counts in its facilities 
allowances for inventory shortages are recorded based on the results of these counts to provide for estimated shortages as of the financial statement date 
reserves for closed properties and asset impairment charges the company maintains reserves for estimated losses on retail stores  distribution warehouses and other properties that are no longer being utilized in current operations 
the company provides for closed property operating lease liabilities using a discount rate to calculate the present value of the remaining noncancellable lease payments after the closing date  net of estimated subtenant income 
the closed property lease liabilities usually are paid over the remaining lease terms  which generally range from one to years 
the company estimates subtenant income and future cash flows based on the company s experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located  the company s previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and existing economic conditions 
owned properties and capital lease properties that are closed are reduced to their estimated fair value 
reduction in the carrying values of property  equipment and leasehold improvements are recognized when expected net future cash flows are less than the assets carrying value 
the company estimates net future cash flows based on its experience and knowledge of the market in which the closed property is located and  when necessary  utilizes local real estate brokers 
adjustments to closed property reserves primarily relate to changes in subtenant income or actual exit costs differing from original estimates 
adjustments are made for changes in estimates in the period in which the changes become known 
the expectations on timing of disposition or sublease and the estimated sales price or sublease income associated with closed properties are impacted by variable factors such as inflation  the general health of the economy  resultant demand for commercial property  the ability to secure subleases  the creditworthiness of sublessees and the company s success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors 
while management believes the current estimates on closed properties are adequate  it is possible that market conditions in the real estate market could cause changes in the company s assumptions and may require additional reserves and asset impairment charges to be recorded 
reserves for self insurance the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  health care for certain employees and general and automobile liability costs 
it is the company s policy to record its self insurance liabilities based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported  discounted at a risk free interest rate 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation  health care and general and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting future inflation rates  discount rates  litigation trends  legal interpretations  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
the company had reserves of approximately and as of february  and february   respectively 
the increase in the reserve is primarily a result of reserves related to 
table of contents the acquired operations 
the impact to the company s liability of each basis point reduction in the discount rate would be to increase the company s liability by approximately benefit plans the company sponsors pension and other postretirement plans in various forms covering substantially all employees who meet eligibility requirements 
the determination of the company s obligation and related expense for company sponsored pension and other postretirement benefits is dependent  in part  on management s selection of certain assumptions used by its actuaries in calculating these amounts 
these assumptions include  among other things  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  affect expense and obligation in future periods 
while the company believes that its assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially impact non union pension and other postretirement obligations and future expenses 
for fiscal  the impact to pension expense of each basis point reduction in the discount rate would be to increase pension expense by approximately and the impact of each basis point reduction in expected return on plan assets would be to increase pension expense by approximately similarly  for postretirement benefits  a one percent change in the health care cost trend rate would impact the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by approximately and the service and interest cost by in fiscal the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  and longer or shorter life spans of participants 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill was  as of february   reflecting an increase of approximately  in fiscal from  as of february  this increase was primarily due to  of goodwill recognized as a result of the acquisition

 business combinations 
for further information  see note business acquisition  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  the company recorded a pre tax goodwill impairment charge of related to the plan to dispose of scott s 
the decrease in goodwill from  as of february  to  as of february  resulted primarily from purchase accounting adjustments of between deferred income taxes and goodwill related to former acquisitions and reductions of goodwill of primarily related to the disposition of pittsburgh and chicago stores  which were partially offset by purchase accounting adjustments to increase goodwill by for the finalization of the valuation in fiscal related to the acquisition of total logistics in fiscal for additional information  see note goodwill and other acquired intangible assets  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in our income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
we record adjustments based on filed returns when we have identified and finalized them  which is generally in a subsequent period 
in conjunction with the acquisition  the company has and will continue to record the deferred tax impacts of purchase accounting adjustments including the ultimate resolution of acquisition tax contingencies and any changes to the respective valuation allowance 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations that can often take many years to resolve 
we recognize liabilities for anticipated tax issues based 
table of contents on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional tax payments will be required 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we reverse the liability and recognize a tax benefit during the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
we record an additional charge in our provision for taxes in the period in which we determine that the recorded tax liability is less than we expect the ultimate assessment to be 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that we are more likely than not to realize 
we have considered forecasted earnings  future taxable income and future prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would increase the valuation allowance 
likewise  if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the net deferred tax assets  we would reverse the applicable portion of the valuation allowance 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in cash from operating activities in fiscal from fiscal is primarily attributable to increased net earnings and depreciation and amortization as a result of the acquisition  which is partially offset by changes in working capital and deferred income taxes

table of contents pension plan health and welfare plan contingencies the company contributes to various multi employer pension plans under collective bargaining agreements  primarily defined benefit pension plans 
these plans generally provide retirement benefits to participants based on their service to contributing employers 
based on available information  the company believes that some of the multi employer plans to which it contributes are under funded 
company contributions to these plans are likely to continue to increase in the near term 
however  the amount of any increase or decrease in contributions will depend on a variety of factors  including the results of the company s collective bargaining efforts  investment return on the assets held in the plans  actions taken by the trustees who manage the plans  and requirements under the pension protection act and or section e of the internal revenue code 
furthermore  if the company were to exit certain markets or otherwise cease making contributions to these plans at this time  it could trigger a withdrawal liability that would require the company to fund its proportionate share of a plan s unfunded vested benefits 
the company also makes contributions to multi employer health and welfare plans in amounts set forth in the related collective bargaining agreements 
some of the collective bargaining agreements contain reserve requirements that may trigger unanticipated contributions resulting in increased health care expenses 
if these health care provisions cannot be renegotiated in a manner that reduces the prospective health care cost as the company intends  the company s selling and administrative expenses could increase in the future
