item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
the actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including  but not limited to  those presented under risk factors in item a and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
for ease of reference  we refer to the fiscal years ended june   june  and june  as fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
overview we design  manufacture and market fiber optic based products  known as photonic processors  which are designed to increase the performance of optical networks 
we sell our products to telecommunications system integrators and their network carrier customers 
we were incorporated in october in california and reincorporated in delaware in january we began making volume shipments of our products during the quarter ended september  in fiscal  we assumed restructuring liabilities with fair values of million at the date of acquisition of the optical components businesses of alcatel lucent and corning  which were included in the purchase price 
subsequent to these acquisitions  we have continued to restructure our organization  primarily through the downsizing of our workforce and the abandonment of excess facilities 
as of june   our accrued restructuring liability balance was million  consisting of excess facilities costs payable through the restructurings have resulted in  among other things  a significant reduction in the size of our workforce  consolidation of our facilities  and increased reliance on outsourced  third party manufacturing 
in march  we announced that we had opened an operations center in thailand to centralize global manufacturing and operational overhead functions in a lower cost region 
in july  we announced the opening of a development and marketing office in shanghai  china 
in march  we announced the sale of ninety percent of the share capital and voting rights of our wholly owned subsidiary  avanex france  which operated our semiconductor fabs and associated product lines located in nozay  france 
this transaction closed on april  although we have relocated most of our manufacturing operations to reduce our production costs  we expect to continuously take actions to further reduce costs and improve our gross margins 
however  there can be no assurance that our cost structure will not increase in the future or that we will be able to align our cost structure with our expectations 
net revenue 
the market for optical equipment continues to evolve and the volume and timing of orders is difficult to predict 
a customer s decision to purchase our products typically involves a commitment of its resources and a lengthy evaluation and product qualification process 
this initial evaluation and product qualification process typically takes several months and includes technical evaluation  integration  testing  planning and implementation into the equipment design 
implementation cycles for our products can be lengthy  and the practice of customers in the communications industry to sporadically place orders with short lead times may cause our net revenue  gross margin  operating results and the identity of our largest customers to vary significantly and unexpectedly from quarter to quarter 
to date  a substantial proportion of our sales have been concentrated with a limited number of customers 
during fiscal  sales to alcatel lucent and tellabs accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
during fiscal  sales to alcatel and nortel accounted for and of our net revenue  respectively 
during fiscal  sales to alcatel accounted for of our net revenue 
we expect that a substantial portion of our sales will remain concentrated with a limited number of customers  as evidenced by the increase in customer concentration 
cost of revenue 
our cost of revenue consists of costs of components and raw materials  direct labor  warranty  manufacturing overhead  payments to our contract manufacturers and inventory write offs for obsolete and excess 
table of contents inventory 
we rely on a single or limited number of suppliers to manufacture some key components and raw materials used in our products  and we rely on the outsourcing of some turnkey solutions 
we write off the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or in excess of future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as products that we no longer market  for which there is no demand  or inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using management s best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
we wrote off excess and obsolete inventory of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal gross margin 
gross margin represents revenue less cost of revenue 
during fiscal  gross margin increased to of revenue  which was an increase in gross margin of percentage points over our fiscal gross margin of 
the increase was due to a more profitable mix of products sold to our customers  decreased vendor costs  improved yields  and cost reductions resulting from having our design and operations teams working with our contract manufacturers to lower production costs 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  fees paid to consultants and outside service providers  costs of allocated facilities  non recurring engineering charges  and prototype costs related to the design  development  testing  pre manufacturing  and significant improvement of our products 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic product development objectives 
we further believe that  in order to meet the changing requirements of our customers  we must continue to fund investments in several development projects in parallel 
sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  and related personnel costs of employees in sales  marketing  customer service  and application engineering functions  costs of allocated facilities  and promotional and other marketing expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs for executive  finance  accounting  legal  and human resources personnel  costs of allocated facilities  recruiting expenses  professional fees  and other corporate expenses 
amortization of intangible assets 
a portion of the purchase price in a business combination is allocated to goodwill and intangibles 
goodwill is not amortized  but rather is assessed for impairment at least annually 
intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
restructuring 
restructuring expense generally includes employee severance costs and the costs of excess facilities associated with formal restructuring plans 
gain on disposal of property and equipment 
gain on disposals includes gains incurred as a result of disposal of property  plant  or equipment for an amount greater than the net book value 
loss on sale of subsidiary 
loss on sale of subsidiary consists of the net loss from the sale of our subsidiary in france on march  interest and other income 
interest and other income consist primarily of interest earned from the investment of our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  and long term investments 
in addition  other income in fiscal includes a gain recognized in relation to warrants issued in connection with our may  convertible notes offering 

table of contents interest and other expense 
interest and other expense consists primarily of interest expense associated with borrowings under our line of credit  senior secured convertible notes  capital lease obligations  equipment loans  and foreign currency exchange rate loss 
income taxes 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  we recognize income taxes using an asset and liability approach 
this approach requires the recognition of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of current and deferred taxes is based on provisions of the enacted tax law and the effects of future changes in tax laws or rates are not anticipated 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
we believe our estimates and assumptions are reasonable  however  actual results and the timing of the recognition of such amounts could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy complies with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize product revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been shipped  risk of loss has been transferred  collectibility is reasonably assured  fees are fixed or determinable and there are no uncertainties with respect to customer acceptance 
we record a provision for estimated sales returns and price adjustments in the same period as when the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns and adjustments  other known factors  and our return policy 
if future sales returns or price adjustment levels differ from the historical data we use to calculate these estimates  changes to the provision may be required 
we generally do not accept product returns from customers  however  we do sell our products under warranty 
the specific terms and conditions of our warranties vary by customer and region in which we do business  the warranty period is generally one year 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the last three years  our uncollectible accounts experience has been almost zero 
at june   we determined that an allowance was not required 
when we become aware  subsequent to delivery  of a customer s potential inability to meet its obligations  we record a specific allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
such an allowance may be magnified due to the concentration of our sales to a limited number of customers 
excess and obsolete inventory 
we write off the cost of inventory that we specifically identify and consider obsolete or excessive to fulfill future sales estimates 
we define obsolete inventory as products that we no longer market or for which there is no demand  or inventory that will no longer be used in the manufacturing process 
excess inventory is generally defined as inventory in excess of projected usage  and is determined using management s best estimate of future demand at the time  based upon information then available to us 
in estimating excess inventory  we use a range of six month to twelve month demand forecast 
we assess inventory on a quarterly basis and write down those inventories which are obsolete or in excess of our forecasted usage to their estimated realizable value 
our estimates of realizable value are based upon our analysis including  but not limited to forecasted sales levels by product  expected product life cycle  product development plans  and future demand requirements 
our marketing department plays a key role in our excess review process by providing updated sales forecasts  managing product rollovers  and working with sub contract manufacturing to maximize recovery of excess inventory 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than our forecasts or actual demand from our customers is lower than our estimates  we may be required to record additional inventory write 
table of contents downs 
if actual market conditions are more favorable than anticipated  inventory previously written down may be sold  resulting in lower cost of sales and higher income from operations than expected in that period 
stock based compensation expense 
we account for employee stock based compensation costs in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r and staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment sab 
we utilize the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock based compensation at the date of grant  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including expected volatility and expected life 
historical volatility was used in estimating the fair value of our stock based awards  and the expected life was estimated to be years using the simplified method permitted under sab further  as required under sfas r  we now estimate forfeitures for options granted that are not expected to vest 
changes in these inputs and assumptions can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
the estimated fair value is charged to earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the underlying awards  which is generally four years 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options having no vesting restrictions and being fully transferable 
accordingly  our estimate of fair value may not represent the value assigned by a third party in an arms length transaction 
while our estimate of fair value and the associated charge to earnings materially impacts our results of operations  it has no impact on our cash position 
goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded in net income loss 
we operate in one segment  which we consider our sole operating unit 
measurement of the fair value of the reporting unit in our annual test for impairment is determined using the market capitalization approach 
the capitalization approach focuses on the fair value of the enterprise  which was determined based on our current market capitalization  and goodwill was determined not to be impaired at june  impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of long lived assets may not be recoverable  we recognize such impairment in the event the net book value of such assets exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows attributable to such assets 
warranties 
in general  we provide a product warranty for one year from the date of shipment 
we accrue for the estimated cost to provide warranty services at the time revenue is recognized 
the specific terms and conditions of our warranties vary by customer and region in which we do business 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based on historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
to the extent we experience increased warranty claim activity or increased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty costs will increase resulting in decreases to gross profit 
conversely  to the extent we experience decreased warranty claim activity  or decreased costs associated with servicing those claims  our warranty costs will decrease resulting in increases to gross profit 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary 
restructuring 
during the past few years we have recorded significant accruals in connection with restructuring programs 
given the significance and complexity of restructuring activities  and the timing of the execution of such activities  the restructuring accrual process involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made  including evaluating real estate market conditions for expected vacancy periods and sub lease rents 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of the restructuring programs  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
purchase accounting 
we account for business combinations under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values 
the recorded values of 
table of contents assets and liabilities are based on management estimates making use of third party valuations  or if market price information is not available  based on the best information available 
the values are based on our judgments and estimates  and accordingly  our financial position or results of operations may be affected by changes in these estimates and judgments 
specifically  our valuation of intangible assets is based on a discounted cash flow valuation methodology that incorporates estimates of future revenue  revenue growth  expenses  estimated useful lives  balance sheet assumptions and weighted average cost of capital 
should these assumptions prove incorrect  we may be required to recognize an impairment of our intangible assets 
contingencies 
we are or have been subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to our initial public offering and other matters 
we evaluate contingent liabilities including threatened or pending litigation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for contingencies 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceedings is considered probable and the amount can be estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based upon management s judgment and the best information available to management at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to its pending claims and litigation and may revise its estimates 
in addition to product warranties  we  from time to time  in the normal course of business  indemnify certain customers with whom we enter into contractual relationships 
we have agreed to hold the other party harmless against third party claims that our products  when used for their intended purpose  infringe the intellectual property rights of such third party or other claims made against certain parties 
it is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of liability under these indemnification obligations due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances that are likely to be involved in each particular claim 
the estimated fair value of these indemnification provisions is minimal 
to date  we have not incurred any costs related to claims under these provisions  and no amounts have been accrued in the accompanying financial statements 
in march  we sold our subsidiary in france 
pursuant to the provisions of french bankruptcy law  in the event that avanex france  now s photonics  declares bankruptcy after such sale  we may be held liable  as manager de facto of s photonics for the payment of all or part of the liabilities of s photonics  should it appear that we committed mismanagement  which would have solely or partially led to the bankruptcy of s photonics  and these liabilities could be significant 
such liability  if incurred  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
in addition  we agreed to indemnify the buyers of avanex france generally for a period of up to two years in an amount generally not exceeding million for breaches of certain representations  warranties and covenants relating to the condition of the business prior to  and at the time of sale  and approximately million for other liabilities 
as of june   the company had accrued million under other accrued expenses for an escrow account related to the sale 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the liability method  which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts  and for net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
change in accounting policy share based payments on july   we adopted the fair value based method for measurement and expense recognition of employee share based compensation arrangements under the provisions of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transitional method 
previously  we had elected to account for employee share based compensation using the intrinsic value method based upon accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related 
table of contents interpretations 
the intrinsic value method generally did not result in any compensation cost being recorded for employee stock options since the exercise price was equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
under the modified prospective transitional method  share based compensation is recognized for awards granted  modified  repurchased  or cancelled subsequent to the adoption of sfas r 
in addition  share based compensation is recognized  subsequent to the adoption of sfas r  for the remaining portion of the vesting period if any for outstanding awards granted prior to the date of adoption 
prior periods have not been adjusted and we continue to provide pro forma disclosure as if we had accounted for employee share based payments in all periods presented under the fair value provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  which is presented in note to consolidated financial statements  under the topic stock based compensation 
we measure share based compensation costs on the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award 
we have elected to treat awards with graded vesting as a single award when estimating fair value 
compensation cost is recognized on a straight line basis over the employee requisite service period 
compensation cost is initially based on the estimated number of options for which the requisite service is expected to be rendered 
this estimate is adjusted in the period once actual forfeitures are known 
refer to note stock based compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for details of stock options and share based compensation costs recorded during the year ended june  in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
this pronouncement requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability on its statement of financial position using prospective application 
sfas no 
also requires an employer to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
in addition  this statement requires an employer to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end statement of financial position  with limited exceptions 
we adopted this statement in fiscal

cost of revenue and gross margin cost of revenue increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the increase in total net revenue 

table of contents cost of revenue decreased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the transfer of most of our internal manufacturing operations to contract manufacturers  which reduced our direct labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
we wrote off excess and obsolete inventory of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  the write off was primarily due to lower demand for certain products and lower expected usage of previously purchased inventory 
in fiscal the write off was primarily due to lower than expected usage of previously purchased inventory

as a result  cost of revenue associated with the sale of this inventory was zero 
cost of revenue for fiscal  and was also offset by million  million and million  respectively  for reversals of previous warranty accruals 
our gross margin percentage improved to for fiscal from for fiscal  primarily due to cost reductions associated with shifting global manufacturing operations to contract manufacturers in lower cost regions and increased focus on design for manufacturability to achieve lower costs 
in addition  the improvement in gross margin percentage was driven by a shift to products with higher volume and higher gross margins 
our gross margin percentage improved to positive for fiscal  compared to negative for fiscal  primarily due to cost reductions resulting from the transfer of most of our global manufacturing operations to contract manufacturers in lower cost regions 
we have recently experienced consistent positive gross margins due to new product introductions and the transfer of our global manufacturing operations to contract manufacturers in lower cost regions 
our gross margins are and will be primarily affected by changes in mix of products sold  manufacturing volume  changes in sales prices  product demand  inventory write downs  sales of previously written off inventory  warranty costs  and product yields 
we expect cost of revenue  as a percentage of net revenue  to fluctuate from period to period 
research and development research and development expenses increased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal as a percentage of net revenue  research and development expenses decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in research and development expenses was primarily due to increased personnel related costs such as stock based compensation expenses and increased headcount in china  offset by closure of our r d office in thailand and sale of our office in france and patent related legal expenses

we expect general and administrative expenses to decline as a percentage of revenue in fiscal there can be no assurance that our general and administrative expenses will decline in the future 
general and administrative expenses decreased million to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the primary reasons for the decrease were reductions in our allowance for doubtful accounts  salaries  and fringe benefits  offset by increased stock based compensation expense  facilities expenses and audit and legal expenses 
amortization of intangible assets amortization of intangible assets decreased by million to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to some of the intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal  which resulted in less expense during the remainder of fiscal amortization of intangible assets decreased by million to million for fiscal  from million for fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to some of the intangible assets becoming fully amortized during fiscal  which resulted in less expense during the remainder of fiscal restructuring over the past several years  we have implemented various restructuring programs to realign resources in response to the changes in our industry and customer demand  and we continue to assess our current and future operating requirements accordingly

the sale closed on april  the purchasers changed the name of avanex france to s photonics following the closing 
the sale involved the divestiture of our laser  terrestrial and submarine pumps and fiber bragg grating fbg product lines 
we will continue to operate our optical interfaces oif business and optical fiber amplifiers and raman amplifiers oax business  which have been transferred to a new wholly owned subsidiary of avanex in france  prior to the closing 
we recorded a loss of million on the sale primarily as a result of the approximately million cash paid  transaction expenses incurred of approximately million  and transfer of approximately million of assets  partially offset by approximately million of liabilities written off  the assumption of approximately million of liabilities by s photonics  write off of cumulative translation gain related to nozay of approximately million  and a reduction of the pension obligation of approximately million related to the sale

this increase was offset by a reduction in interest expense during the later part of fiscal as certain convertible note holders converted million of convertible note into shares of our common stock 
provision for income taxes the provisions for income taxes of million and million were recorded for estimated taxes due on income generated in certain state and foreign tax jurisdictions for fiscal and  respectively 
the income tax provision for fiscal reflects an effective tax rate of negative  which differs from the statutory tax rate due to the tax impact of income from foreign operations and unbenefited losses in the us taxes due to the full valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for income taxes provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets  if realization of such assets is more likely than not to occur 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes its historical operating performance and reported cumulative net losses since inception  we provide a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we reassess the need for our valuation allowance on a quarterly basis

avanex leases certain of its equipment and other fixed assets under capital lease agreements 
the assets and liabilities under capital leases are recorded at the lesser of the present value of aggregate future minimum lease payments  including estimated bargain purchase options  or the fair value of the assets under lease 
assets under capital leases are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the assets 
there were minimal payments due under capital lease agreements as of june  as of june   avanex had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term investments of million for an aggregate of million  excluding restricted cash of million 
the fiscal decrease in cash and cash equivalents was due primarily to the sale of million shares of common stock in march generating million in proceeds net of offering costs and million decrease in short term investments  offset by net cash used in operations of million 
the fiscal decrease of million in restricted cash was primarily due to a reduction in our obligation on operating leases  which reduced the cash held against those leases

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the objectives of our investment activities are preservation and safety of principal  maintenance of adequate liquidity to meet cash flow requirements  attainment of a competitive market rate of return on investments  minimization of risk on all investments  and avoidance of inappropriate concentrations of investments 
we place our investments with high quality credit issuers in short term and long term securities and maturities can range from overnight to months 
the average maturity of the portfolio will not exceed 
table of contents months 
the portfolio includes only marketable securities with active secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
accordingly  we do not believe that our investments have significant exposure to interest rate risk 
the following table summarizes average interest rate and fair market value of the short term securities and restricted cash and investments held by avanex in thousands  which were classified as available for sale at june  and june  june  june  amortized cost fair market value average annual interest rate exchange rate risk our international business is subject to normal international business risks including  but not limited to  differing economic conditions  changes in political climate  differing tax structures  other regulations and restrictions  and foreign exchange rate volatility 
accordingly  our future results could be materially adversely affected by changes in these or other factors 
we have operations in the united states  china  thailand  france  and italy 
accordingly  we have sales and expenses that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business could cause foreign currency translation gains or losses that we would recognize in the period incurred 
a fluctuation in the dollar at june  would have led to an additional profit of approximately million dollar strengthening  or an additional loss of approximately million dollar weakening on our net dollar position in outstanding assets and liabilities 
we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on our future operating results because of the variability of currency exposure and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates 
it has not been our recent practice to engage in the hedging of foreign currency transactions to mitigate for foreign currency risk  and currently  we do not hedge our exposure to translation gains and losses related to foreign currency net asset exposures
