item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations throughout this discussion  references are made to the following financial measures constant currency  adjusted net earnings  adjusted basic net earnings per share and adjusted diluted net earnings per share 
these financial measures do not replace the presentation of stryker corporation s the company or stryker reported financial results under generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the company has provided these supplemental non gaap financial measures because they provide meaningful information regarding the company s results on a consistent and comparable basis for the periods presented 
management uses these non gaap financial measures for reviewing the operating results of its business segments  for analyzing potential future business trends in connection with its budget process and bases certain annual bonus plans on these non gaap financial measures 
in order to measure the company s sales performance on a constant currency basis  it is necessary to remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which affects the comparability and trend of sales 
in order to measure the company s earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis  it is necessary to exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings 
these items include purchased in process research and development charges recorded in  and and the additional income taxes associated with the repatriation of foreign earnings recorded in additional details regarding the nature  determination and financial statement impact of these items are included in results of operations 
given the nature of these items  management believes that excluding them from certain financial metrics is more representative of the company s past and potential future operational performance 
in addition  the company believes investors will utilize this information to evaluate period to period results on a comparable basis and to better understand potential future operating results 
the company encourages investors and other users of these financial statements to review its consolidated financial statements and other publicly filed reports in their entirety and not to rely solely on any single financial measure

management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
estimates are based on historical experience  when available  and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that of its significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements  an understanding of the following critical accounting policies is important in obtaining an overall understanding of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable 
the company makes estimates regarding the future ability of its customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience and expected future trends 
if actual customer financial conditions are less favorable than projected by management  additional accounts receivable write offs may be necessary  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
inventory reserves the company maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of current carrying costs 
the markets in which the company operates are highly competitive and new products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis 
such marketplace changes may cause some of the company s products to become obsolete 
the company makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience  expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends 
if actual product life cycles  product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required  which could unfavorably affect future operating results 
income taxes the company operates in multiple tax jurisdictions both inside and outside the united states 
accordingly  management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions 
tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues  including inventory transfer pricing and product royalty arrangements  may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different tax rates 
because tax adjustments in certain jurisdictions can be significant  the company records accruals representing management s best estimate of the probable resolution of these matters 
these income tax accruals are included within the income taxes liability in the consolidated balance sheets 
to the extent additional information becomes available  such accruals are adjusted to reflect the revised estimated probable outcome 
other matters the company distributes its products throughout the world 
as a result  the company s financial results could be significantly affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
the company s operating results are primarily exposed to changes in exchange rates among the united states dollar  the japanese yen and european currencies  in particular the euro and the british pound 
when the united states dollar weakens against foreign currencies  the dollar value of sales denominated in foreign currencies increases 
when the united states dollar strengthens  the opposite situation occurs 
the company manufactures its products in the united states  france  germany  ireland  switzerland  canada and puerto rico and incurs the costs to manufacture in the applicable local currencies 
this worldwide deployment of factories serves to partially mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate changes on the company s cost of sales 
the company enters into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies  thereby limiting risk to the company that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates 
these nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to intercompany receivables and payables arising from intercompany purchases of manufactured products 
the periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions  with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies 
all forward currency exchange contracts are marked to market each period with resulting gains losses included in other income expense in the consolidated statements of earnings 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from to days 
at december   the company had outstanding forward currency exchange contracts to purchase million and sell million of various currencies principally united states dollars and euros with maturities ranging principally from to days 
the estimated fair value of forward currency exchange contracts represents the measurement of the contracts at month end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points 
a hypothetical change in foreign currencies relative to the u 
s 
dollar would change the december  fair value by approximately million 
the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on its outstanding forward currency exchange contracts but does not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties
