item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
note that our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition the company derives revenue from the sale of its software products  professional consulting  and support and maintenance services 
we recognize license revenue when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
from time to time we enter into extended payment programs with creditworthy customers 
we recognize revenue related to extended payment programs when payment becomes due to the company 
in making our decision to recognize revenue we must make a determination of the credit worthiness of our customer 
this determination involves management judgment and while management believes that it can make reliable judgments  there is no guarantee that the revenue recognized will be collected 
the credit worthiness of customers is further analyzed in the section below entitled accounts receivable 
we recognize revenue under multiple element arrangements using the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements under the arrangement 
we have established sufficient vsoe for the value of our consulting  training  and other services  based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenues are recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with consulting  training or other services 
our products and the industries in which we compete are not static and the determination of vsoe involves judgment 
management believes that we will continue to be able to use the residual method for recognizing license revenue under multiple element arrangements 
if  for any reason  we are unable to continue to use the residual method  the timing of revenue recognition could be affected and  consequently  the trends that we are currently experiencing 
our professional services include custom font design  consulting services  development  and training 
we recognize professional services revenue under software development contracts as services are provided for per diem contracts or by using the percentage of completion method of accounting for long term fixed price contracts 
provisions for any estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses become probable 
we had no long term contracts in progress as of december  we recognize revenue from end user product sales upon delivery of the software  net of estimated returns and allowances  if collection is probable 
we estimate returns and allowances based on historical rates and as of december   we had a reserve of approximately  reserves reduce revenue recognized  as necessary  at the time the related revenue is recorded 
we periodically adjust estimates for returns based upon historical rates of return 
while management believes that it can make reliable estimates  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates 
we generally warrant that our products will function substantially in accordance with the documentation provided to customers for days following initial delivery 
as of december   we had not incurred any expense related to warranty claims 
we estimate reserves based on historical rates and  accordingly  have not recorded a warranty reserve 
while management believes that we can make reliable estimates  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates 
please refer to note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on our revenue recognition policies 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  statement of financial accounting standard sfas r during the first quarter of fiscal we elected the modified prospective method  under which prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 

table of contents we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and awards 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected term of options granted by calculating the average term from our historical stock option exercise experience 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by historical volatility 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option pricing model on zero coupon yields implied from us treasury issues with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future and therefore use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all share based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and net income per share 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and awards 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the guidance in sfas r is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the sfas r disclosures 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company tested recorded goodwill for impairment 
we have determined that we do not have separate reporting units and thus goodwill is tested for impairment based upon an enterprise wide valuation 
we conducted impairment testing as of december  and determined that the fair value of the enterprise was greater than its carrying value 

table of contents although none of the goodwill was impaired  there can be no assurance that  upon completion of a future review  a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
sfas no 
required certain disclosures upon adoption that we have included in note k in the notes to consolidated financial statements included herewith 
accounts receivable we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we identify 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have experienced in the past 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that we will recover our deferred tax assets from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe recovery unlikely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
determination of our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets requires significant management judgment 
we have fully reserved against our tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
we base our valuation allowance on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
the determination of the valuation allowance requires us to make estimates  which we cannot guarantee will prove to be accurate

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
this accounting standard will be effective for us beginning january  we are currently assessing the provisions of fin in september  the securities and exchange commission the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab addressing how the effects of prior year uncorrected financial statement misstatements should be considered in current year financial statements 
sab requires registrants to quantify misstatements using both balance sheet and income statement approaches and to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relative quantitative and qualitative factors 
sab does not change the sec staff s previous guidance in staff accounting bulletin no 
on evaluating the materiality of misstatements 
sab addresses the mechanics of correcting misstatements that include the effects from prior years 
additionally  sab requires registrants to apply the new guidance for the first time that a registrant identifies material errors in existence at the beginning of the first fiscal year ending after november  by correcting those errors through a one time cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings 
we do not anticipate the adoption of sab to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which establishes a comprehensive framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
specifically  sfas no 
sets forth a definition of fair value  and establishes a hierarchy prioritizing the inputs to valuation techniques  giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the provisions of sfas no 
are generally required to be applied on a prospective basis 
we do not expect this standard to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments as of december   the company did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under sfas no 
all of the company s investments are short term money market accounts and bank deposits that are carried on the company s books at fair market value 
accordingly  the company has no quantitative information concerning the market risk of participating in such investments 
primary market risk exposures the company s primary market risk exposures are in the areas of interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our investment portfolio of cash equivalent and short term investments is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe this risk is immaterial due to the short term nature of these investments 
our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations has been and is expected to continue to be modest due to the fact that  when active  the operations of our international subsidiary  bitstream  bv  are conducted almost exclusively in local currency 
bitstream  bv is currently inactive and thus we had no impact of currency exchange rate movements on inter company transactions for the year ended december  international subsidiary operations  if resumed  will be translated into us dollars and consolidated for reporting purposes 
currently  we do not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
