item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this report 
the company s operations are conducted through its operating subsidiaries  kinro  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  kinro and lippert components  inc and its subsidiaries collectively  lippert 
each have operations in both the rv and mh segments 
at december   the company s subsidiaries operated plants in the united states and one in canada 
the rv segment accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent of consolidated net sales for the rv segment manufactures a variety of products used primarily in the production of recreational vehicles  including windows  doors  chassis  chassis parts  slide out mechanisms and related power units  and electric stabilizer jacks 
during the last few years  the company has also introduced leveling devices  axles  steps  bedlifts  suspension systems and thermoformed bath and kitchen products for rvs 
approximately percent of the company s rv segment sales are of products used in travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs 
the balance represents sales of components for motorhomes  as well as specialty trailers for hauling equipment  boats  personal watercraft and snowmobiles  and axles for specialty trailers 
travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs accounted for percent of all rvs shipped by the industry in  up from percent in the mh segment  which accounted for percent of consolidated net sales for and percent of consolidated net sales for  manufactures a variety of products used in the production of manufactured homes  and to a lesser extent  modular housing and office units  including vinyl and aluminum windows and screens  chassis  chassis parts  axles  tires and thermoformed bath and kitchen products 
other than sales of specialty trailers and related axles  which aggregated approximately million and million in and  respectively  sales to industries other than manufacturers of rvs and manufactured homes are not considered significant 
however  certain of the company s mh segment customers manufacture both manufactured homes and modular homes  and certain of the products manufactured by the company are suitable for both manufactured homes and modular homes 
as a result  the company is not always able to determine in which type of home its products are installed 
intersegment sales are insignificant 
industry background recreational vehicle industry according to the recreational vehicle industry association rvia  industry wholesale production of travel trailer and fifth wheel rvs  the company s primary rv market  increased percent in the first six months of in contrast  retail sales of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs were relatively flat in the first half of the company believes the difference between the growth of wholesale shipments of towable rvs and the flat retail sales in the first half of was partly due to dealer restocking of inventories in the early part of  which were depleted because of sales of approximately  to  units to the federal emergency management agency fema related to the gulf coast hurricanes  as well as canadian retail sales  which were very strong during the first half of canadian retail sales are not included in us retail statistics  while wholesale shipments to canada are included in wholesale statistics 
it also appears that dealer inventories increased during this period  and that dealers subsequently reduced their orders for new units in the latter part of in order to bring their inventories more in line with current sales rates 
in the second half of  retail sales of these types of rvs were down percent 
the company believes the slowdown in retail sales was caused by a combination of geopolitical and economic factors during the spring and summer of  including rapidly increasing fuel prices  higher interest rates and continued conflict in the middle east which threatened fuel supplies 
in response to the slow down in retail sales and the increase in dealer inventories  in the second half of  dealers apparently reduced their purchases of towable rvs  causing wholesale production of these types of rvs to decline by percent in the same period 
recent rv dealer surveys indicate inventories of towable rvs have begun to improve  but are still higher than dealers prefer 
further  interest rates have stabilized and fuel prices are well below the peaks reached in however  consumer confidence  a strong barometer for consumer demand for rvs  has been volatile over the last several months 
industry wholesale shipments for and include an estimate of  and  travel trailers  respectively  related to the gulf coast hurricanes 
also  in and  fema purchased  and  emergency living units elus  respectively  from rv manufacturers  which were not included in industry statistics 
the travel trailers and elus ordered by fema included fewer features and amenities  such as slide out mechanisms  than the travel trailers typically produced by the industry 
as a result  the company s average content for the units purchased by fema was substantially less than the company s average content in typical travel trailers 
it is expected that many of the elus purchased by fema will not be resold to traditional rv consumers 
subsequent to april  there was no significant hurricane related activity 
industry wholesale shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs increased percent in  as compared to  while according to industry reports  retail shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs declined percent 
industry wholesale shipments of motorhomes declined percent in  as compared to  and according to industry reports  retail shipments of motorhomes declined nearly percent 
excluding the elus  which are not included in the rvia statistics  the rvia is projecting a percent decline in wholesale shipments of all types of rvs in  and a percent decline in shipments of travel trailers and fifth wheel rvs 
these declines reflect the dealer restocking of inventories after the gulf coast hurricanes as noted above  which is not expected to recur in in the long term  increasing industry rv sales are expected to be driven by positive demographics  as demand for rvs is strongest from the over age group  which is the fastest growing segment of the population 
according to us census bureau projections in march  there will be in excess of million more people over the age of by since  the rvia has employed an advertising campaign to attract customers in the to age group  and the number of rv s owned by those to has grown faster than all other age groups 
further  the popularity of traveling to nascar and college sporting events also appears to be a motivation for consumers to purchase rvs 
manufactured housing industry manufactured housing industry production declined approximately percent from to  to  homes in as a result of i limited credit availability for typical purchasers of manufactured homes  ii high interest rate spreads between conventional mortgages on site built homes and chattel loans for manufactured homes chattel loans are loans secured only by the home which is sited on leased land  and iii unusually high repossessions of manufactured homes 
industry production for included approximately  homes purchased by fema for relief from hurricanes 
during  industry production increased approximately percent  to nearly  homes  primarily because of an estimated  homes purchased by fema to provide emergency housing for hurricane victims during the later part of due to demand by fema during the later part of  there was a significant shift in production toward smaller  single section manufactured homes in which the company has substantially less product content per home than in multi section homes 
the manufactured housing institute mhi reported that during  industry wholesale shipments of manufactured homes declined percent from to approximately  homes 
while industry wholesale shipments had been up percent in the first half of  due partly to an estimated  homes purchased by fema  industry wholesale shipments of manufactured homes were down percent for the last six months of this reduction in the second half of compared to the same period in was partly due to the fema purchases in  and partly due to an industry wide reduction in production 
the industry wholesale shipments of manufactured homes for included a percent decrease in shipments of the smaller  single section homes  coupled with an percent decline in shipments of the larger  multi section homes 
the company s average content for single section homes is substantially less than the company s average content in multi section homes 
industry analysts anticipate that sales of manufactured homes could be aided in  as the permanent rebuilding of gulf coast hurricane stricken areas might create demand for manufactured homes  including the larger multi section homes 
new home construction was supposedly delayed during because of the extensive cleanup that was required after the gulf coast hurricanes  and the delay in settling insurance claims by homeowners 
the company believes that long term prospects for manufactured housing are positive because of favorable demographic trends  and because manufactured homes provide quality  affordable housing 
raw material prices the prices the company pays for steel  which represents about percent of the company s raw material costs  and other key raw materials have been volatile since the beginning of during the company received further cost increases from its suppliers of key raw materials 
to offset the impact of higher raw material costs  the company has implemented sales price increases to its customers 
the company estimates that substantially all raw material cost increases received through were passed on to customers  although material costs as a percent of sales has increased  particularly for products which are made primarily from steel 
the company was also notified by certain of its suppliers of certain raw materials of cost increases which are scheduled to go into effect during the first quarter of the company continues to evaluate and implement sales price increases with customers where needed to offset the affect of cost increases

the case purports to be a class action on behalf of the named plaintiff and all others similarly situated 
plaintiffs allege that certain bathtubs manufactured by kinro  and sold under the name better bath for use in manufactured homes  fail to comply with certain safety standards relating to fire spread control established by the united states department of housing and urban development 
plaintiff alleges that sale of these products is in violation of various provisions of the california consumers legal remedies act sec 
et seq  the magnuson moss warranty act sec 
et seq  and the california song beverly consumer warranty act sec 
et seq plaintiffs seek to require defendants to notify members of the class of the allegations in the proceeding and the claims made  to repair or replace the allegedly defective products  to reimburse members of the class for repair  replacement and consequential costs  to cease the sale and distribution of the allegedly defective products  and to pay actual and punitive damages and plaintiffs attorneys fees 
defendants believe that the allegations in the complaint are unfounded  and intend to vigorously defend against the claims  as well as plaintiffs standing as a class 
in the normal course of business  the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims 
all such matters are subject to uncertainties and outcomes that are not predictable with assurance 
while these matters could materially affect operating results when resolved in future periods  it is management s opinion that after final disposition  including anticipated insurance recoveries  any monetary liability or financial impact to the company beyond that provided in the consolidated balance sheet as of december   would not be material to the company s financial position or annual results of operations 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development and selection of its critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the company s board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to the critical accounting policies 
inventories inventories finished goods  work in process and raw materials are stated at the lower of cost  determined on a first in  first out basis  or market 
cost is determined based solely on those charges incurred in the acquisition and production of the related inventory ie material  labor and manufacturing overhead costs 
the company estimates an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory reserves may be required 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain health and workers compensation benefits up to certain stop loss limits 
such costs are accrued based on known claims and an estimate of incurred  but not reported ibnr claims 
ibnr claims are estimated using historical lag information and other data provided by claims administrators 
this estimation process is subjective  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
warranty the company provides warranty terms based upon the type of product that is sold 
the company estimates the warranty accrual based upon various relevant factors  including the company s i historical warranty experience  ii product mix  and iii sales patterns 
the accounting for warranty accruals requires the company to make assumptions and judgments  and to the extent that future actual results differ from original estimates  adjustments to recorded accruals may be necessary 
income taxes the company s tax provision is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates and tax planning strategies 
significant management judgment is required in determining the tax provision and in evaluating the company s tax position 
the company established additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that our tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain tax positions that are likely to be challenged and may or may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
the company adjusts these tax accruals in light of changing facts and circumstances 
the effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the expected outcome of tax audits 
the company s accompanying consolidated balance sheets also include deferred tax assets resulting from deductible temporary differences  which are expected to reduce future taxable income 
these assets are based on management s estimate of realizability based upon forecasted taxable income 
realizability of these assets is reassessed at the end of each reporting period based upon the company s forecast of future taxable income 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income could affect the ultimate realization of certain deferred tax assets  and may result in the recording of a valuation reserve 
for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances occur  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value would be recorded 
the long term nature of these assets requires the estimation of its cash inflows and outflows several years into the future 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis and between annual tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of a reporting unit may exceed its fair value 
the company conducts its required annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
the impairment test uses a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit 
this model requires the use of long term planning forecasts and assumptions regarding industry specific economic conditions that are outside the control of the company 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
legal contingencies the company is subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims in the normal course of business 
each quarter  the company formally evaluates pending proceedings  lawsuits and other claims with counsel 
these contingencies require the judgment of management in assessing the likelihood of adverse outcomes and the potential range of probable losses 
liabilities for legal matters are accrued for when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated  based upon current law and existing information 
estimates of contingencies may change in the future due to new developments or changes in legal approach 
actual results and events could differ significantly from management estimates 
stock options effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
revised share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement requires compensation expense to be measured based on the estimated fair value of the share based awards and recognized in income on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
the implementation of sfas no 
r had an impact on net income of less than million in related to stock options granted prior to january   and will have no impact in and beyond 
from january   through december   the company accounted for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
using the fair value method  which was considered the preferable method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
during the transition period  the company utilized the prospective method under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosures 
all stock options granted are being expensed on a straight line basis over the stock option vesting period based on fair value  determined using the black scholes option pricing method  at the date the stock options were granted 
prior to january   the company had applied the disclosure only option of sfas no 
accordingly  no compensation cost has been recognized in and for stock options granted prior to january  if compensation cost for the company s stock option plan had been recognized in the income statement based upon the fair value method  net income would have been reduced to the pro forma amounts indicated below for the years ended december  in thousands  except per share amounts net income  as reported add compensation expense related to stock options included in reported net income  net of related tax effects deduct total compensation expense related to stock options determined under fair value method for all stock option awards  net of related tax effects pro forma net income net income per common share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma other estimates the company makes a number of other estimates and judgments in the ordinary course of business related to product returns  doubtful accounts  lease terminations  asset retirement obligations  post retirement benefits and contingencies 
establishing reserves for these matters requires management s estimate and judgment with regard to risk and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances and may also be developed in conjunction with outside advisors  as appropriate 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future

prices of certain commodities have historically been volatile 
the prices the company paid for key raw materials remained volatile during and in the first quarter of  the company received further cost increases from its suppliers of certain key raw materials

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of its financing activities 
on october   the company entered into a five year interest rate swap with keybank national association with an initial notional amount of million from which it will receive periodic payments at the month libor rate percent at december  based upon the november  reset date  and make periodic payments at a fixed rate of percent  with settlement and rate reset dates every november  february  may and august the notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases by million on each quarterly reset date 
at december   the notional amount was million 
the fair value of the swap was zero at inception 
at december  the fair value of the interest rate swap was million 
the company has designated this swap as a cash flow hedge of certain borrowings under the line of credit and recognized the effective portion of the change in fair value as part of other comprehensive income  with the ineffective portion  which was insignificant  recognized in earnings currently 
on june   the company entered into a seven year interest rate swap with hsbc bank usa  na with a notional amount of million from which it will receive periodic payments at the month libor rate percent at december  based upon the december  reset date and make periodic payments at a fixed rate of percent  with settlement and rate reset dates on the last business day of every march  june  september and december 
the notional amount of the interest rate swap decreases by approximately million on each quarterly reset date beginning september  at december   the notional amount was million 
the fair value of the swap was zero at inception 
the company has designated this swap as a cash flow hedge of the senior promissory notes issued on june   and recognized the effective portion of the change in fair value as part of other comprehensive income  with the ineffective portion recognized in earnings currently 
the fair value of this swap at december  was million 
at december   the company had million of fixed rate debt plus million outstanding under the two interest rate swaps 
assuming there is a decrease of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings of a similar nature subsequent to december   which the company becomes unable to capitalize on in the short term as a result of the structure of its fixed rate financing  future cash flows would be approximately million lower per annum than if the fixed rate financing could be obtained at current market rates 
at december   the company had million of variable rate debt  excluding the million outstanding under the two interest rate swaps 
assuming there is an increase of basis points in the interest rate for borrowings under these variable rate loans subsequent to december   and outstanding borrowings of million  future cash flows would be reduced by less than million per annum 
in addition  the company is periodically exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of temporary investments in money market funds  however  such investing activity is not material to the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flow 
if the actual change in interest rates is substantially different than basis points  or the outstanding borrowings change significantly  the net impact of interest rate risk on the company s cash flow may be materially different than that disclosed above
