overview we develop  market and support an integrated suite of vbusiness video enabled ebusiness applications  all powered by the avistarvos application platform 
from the desktop  we deliver high quality interactive video calling  content creation and publishing  broadcast origination and distribution  video on demand  and integrated data sharing 
the avistar video and data collaboration applications are all managed by the avistarvos software application 
by integrating video tightly into the way they work  our customers can use our system to help reduce costs and improve productivity and communications within the enterprise and between enterprises  to enhance relationships with customers  suppliers and partners 
using avistarvos software and leveraging video  telephony and internet networking standards  avistar applications are designed to be scalable  reliable  cost effective  easy to use  and capable of evolving with communications networks as bandwidth increases and as new standards and protocols emerge 
we currently sell our system directly to enterprises in selected strategic vertical markets  and have focused initially on the financial services industry 
our objective is to establish our technology as the standard for networked video through direct sales  indirect channel sales partnerships and the licensing of our technology to others 
we also seek to license our broad portfolio of patents covering  among other areas  video and rich media collaboration technologies  networked real time text and non text communications and desktop workstation echo cancellation 
we operate on a week fiscal year ending december we operate in two segments 
avistar communications corporation engages in the design  development  manufacture  sale and marketing of networked video communications products and associated support services 
collaboration properties  inc  or cpi  our wholly owned subsidiary  engages in the prosecution  maintenance  support and licensing of the intellectual property that we have developed  some of which is used in our products 
since inception  we have recognized the innovative value of our research and development efforts  and have invested in securing protection for these innovations through domestic and foreign patent applications and issuance 
as of december   we held us and foreign patents  which we look to license to others in the collaboration technology marketplace 
change in accounting treatment in september  we received a comment letter from the sec relating to our form k  which included questions regarding our accounting for the november settlement and patent cross license agreement with polycom  inc 
the settlement and patent cross license agreement resulted in a million one time payment by polycom  inc to us  and a payment by us to our own litigation counsel of million in contingent legal fees 
our form k for the fiscal year ended december  and form q for the three  six and nine months ended march   june  and september   respectively  reported the one time payment by polycom  inc as revenue  recognized ratably over a five year period  net of contingent legal fees 
as a result of the sec s inquiry as to whether the polycom  inc transaction should be characterized as revenue and after discussions with the sec  we concluded that a reclassification of license revenues from revenue to a component of operating expenses and reflected as income from settlement and patent licensing was necessary for previously filed financial reports 
the reclassification of the proceeds and expenses from the polycom  inc settlement and patent cross license agreement had no effect on reported net loss  loss per share  stockholders equity deficit or net cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities  but did have the effect of overstating revenues and operating expenses for previously issued interim and annual consolidated financial statements  as of and for the quarters and year to date periods ended december   march   june  and september  in addition  the balance sheet as of december  was amended to reflect the gross effect of the million payment by polycom  inc to us  and the payment of million of contingent legal fees by us  which was previously reported on a net basis as deferred revenue 
significant concentrations  revenue recognition  segment reporting footnotes and the unaudited interim results have been modified to reclassify the polycom  inc proceeds from revenue to income from settlement and patent licensing  to be consistent with the presentation of the net proceeds from the polycom  inc settlement and patent cross license agreement in the and statements of operations 
the presentation within operations is supported by a determination that the polycom  inc licensing transaction is central to the activities that constitute our ongoing major or central operations  but that the settlement may also contain a gain element related to the settlement  which is not considered revenue under the financial accounting standards board concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
we did not have sufficient historical evidence to support a reasonable determination of value for the purpose of segregating the transaction into revenue related to the patent licensing and an operating or non operating gain upon settlement of litigation  resulting in the determination that the entire transaction is more appropriately classified as income from settlement and patent licensing within operations  as opposed to revenue

license agreement with sony corporation in july  we entered into a patent license agreement with sony corporation and sony computer entertainment  inc 
under the license agreement  cpi granted sony corporation and its subsidiaries a license to all of cpi s patents with a filing date on or before january  for a specific field of use relating to video conferencing 
the license covers sony s video conferencing apparatus as well as other products  including video enabled personal computer products and certain sony computer entertainment  inc playstation products 
as consideration for the licenses granted under the agreement  sony corporation agreed to make an upfront license payment of million and sony computer entertainment  inc has agreed to make future royalty payments relating to the sale  in certain countries  of certain sony computer entertainment  inc products 
the million upfront payment was recognized by us as licensing revenue in the three month period ended september  and future royalty payments  if any  will be recognized as they occur in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  income from settlement and patent licensing  stock based compensation  valuation of accounts receivable  and valuation of inventories 
revenue recognition we derive product revenue from the sale and licensing of our video enabled networked communications system  consisting of a suite of avistar designed software and hardware products  including third party components 
we also derive revenue from fees for installation  maintenance  support  training services and software development 
in addition  we derive revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property portfolio 
in  we licensed all of cpi s patents with a filing date on or before january  for a specific field of use relating to video conferencing to sony corporation and sony computer entertainment  inc product revenue as a percentage of total revenue was  and for  and  respectively 
we recognize product and services revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition sop  as amended by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions sop 
we derive product revenue from the sale and licensing of a set of desktop endpoint products hardware and software and infrastructure products hardware and software that combine to form an avistar video enabled collaboration solution 
services revenue includes revenue from installation services  post contract customer support  training  out of pocket expenses  freight and software development 
the installation services that we offer to customers relate to the physical set up and configuration of desktop and infrastructure components of our solution 
the fair value of all product  installation services  post contract customer support and training offered to customers is determined based on the price charged when such products or services are sold separately 
arrangements that include multiple product and service elements may include software and hardware products  as well as installation services  post contract customer support and training 
pursuant to sop  we recognize revenue when all of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred  iii the fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is probable 
we apply these criteria as discussed below persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
we require a written contract  signed by both the customer and us  or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or volume purchase agreement with us prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software and hardware to our customers physically 
our standard delivery terms are fob shipping point 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard terms generally require payment within to days of the date of invoice 
where these terms apply  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and we recognize revenue upon delivery assuming other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the payment terms do not meet this standard  but rather involve extended payment terms  we may not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and would then recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
collectibility is probable 
to recognize revenue  we must judge collectibility of the arrangement fees  which we do on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with which we have had a history of successful collections 
for new customers  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay 
if we determine that collectibility is not probable based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue when cash is collected 
if there are any undelivered elements  we defer revenue for those elements  as long as vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists for the undelivered elements 
additionally  when we provide installation services  the product and installation revenue is recognized upon completion of the installation process and receipt of customer confirmation  subject to the satisfaction of the revenue recognition criteria described above 
we believe that the fee associated with the delivered product elements does not meet the collectibility criteria if the installation services have not been completed 
customer confirmation is obtained and documented by means of a standard form indicating the installation services were provided and the hardware and software components were installed 
when the customer or a third party provides installation services  the product revenue is recognized upon shipment  subject to satisfaction of the revenue recognition criteria described above 
payment for product is due upon shipment  subject to specific payment terms 
payment for installation and professional services is due upon providing the services  subject to specific payment terms 
reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses and shipping costs incurred during installation and support services have not been significant to date 
these expenses are recognized as revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred 
the price charged for maintenance and or support is defined in the product sale contract  and is based on a fixed price for both hardware and software components as stipulated in the customer agreement 
customers have the option to renew the maintenance and or support services in subsequent periods at the same or similar rate as paid in the initial year subject to contractual adjustments for inflation in some cases 
revenue from maintenance and support is recognized pro rata over the maintenance and or support term  which is typically one year in length 
payments for services made in advance of the provision of services are recorded as deferred revenue and customer deposits in the accompanying balance sheets 
training services are offered independently of the purchase of product 
the value of these training services is determined based on the price charged when such services are sold separately 
training revenue is recognized upon performance of the service 
we recognize service revenue from software development contracts in accordance with sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
revenue related to contracts for software development is recognized using the percentage of completion method  when all of the following conditions are met a contract exists with the customer at a fixed price  we have fulfilled all of our material contractual obligations to the customer for each deliverable of the contract  verification of completion of the deliverable has been received  and collection of the receivable is probable 
amounts billed to customers in excess of revenues recognized to date are deferred and recorded as deferred revenue and customer deposits in the accompanying balance sheets 
assumptions used for recording revenue and earnings are adjusted in the period of change to reflect revisions in contract value and estimated costs to complete the contract 
any anticipated losses on contracts in progress are charged to earnings when identified 
we also derive revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property portfolio 
we recognize revenue from the licensing of our intellectual property portfolio according to sop  based on the terms of the royalty  partnership and cross licensing agreements involved 
in the event that a license to our intellectual property is granted after the commencement of litigation proceedings between us and the licensee  the proceeds of such transaction are recognized as licensing revenue by us only if sufficient historical evidence exists for the determination of fair value of the licensed patents to support the segregation of the proceeds between a gain on litigation settlement and patent license revenues consistent with financial accounting standards board fasb concepts statement no 
 elements of financial statements 
as of december   these criteria for recognizing license revenue following the commencement of litigation had not been met 
to date  a significant portion of our revenue has resulted from sales to a limited number of customers 
for  we recorded revenue of approximately million  or of total revenue from sony corporation and sony computer entertainment  inc  deutsche bank ag and their affiliates  and ubs warburg llc and their affiliates  each of whom accounted for greater than of our total revenue 
for  we recorded revenue of approximately million  or of total revenue  from deutsche bank ag and their affiliates  and ubs warburg llc and their affiliates  each of whom accounted for greater than of our total revenue 
for  we recorded revenue of approximately million  or of total revenue  from deutsche bank ag and their affiliates and ubs warburg llc and their affiliates  each of whom accounted for greater than of our total revenue for we anticipate that our revenue  and therefore  our operating results for any given period  will continue to depend to a significant extent on a limited number of customers 
as a result  the loss of or a reduction in sales to any one of these customers would have a significant adverse impact on our operations and financial performance 
international revenue  which consists of sales to customers with operations principally in western europe and asia  comprised of total revenue for  for and for income from settlement and patent licensing we recognize the proceeds from settlement and patent licensing agreements based on the terms involved 
when litigation has been filed prior to a settlement and patent licensing agreement  and insufficient historical evidence exists for the determination of fair value of the patents licensed to support the segregation of the proceeds between a gain on litigation settlement and patent license revenues  we report all proceeds in income from settlement and patent licensing within operating costs and expenses 
the gain portion of the proceeds  when sufficient historical evidence exists to segregate the proceeds  would be reported in other income according to sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
to date  all proceeds from settlement and patent licensing agreements entered into following the commencement of litigation have been reported as income from settlement and patent licensing 
when a patent license agreement is entered into prior to the commencement of litigation  we report the proceeds of such transaction as licensing revenue in the period in which such proceeds are received  subject to the revenue recognition criteria described above 
stock based compensation we adopted sfas no 
r effective january  sfas no 
r is a new and very complex accounting standard  the application of which requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding black scholes merton assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option terms  as well as expected option forfeiture rates used to value equity based compensation 
there is little experience or guidance with respect to developing these assumptions and models for nontransferable options 
sfas no 
r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in net income loss 
we incurred million  or earnings per share in employee stock based compensation expense in due to adoption of sfas no 
r  all of which was recorded to net loss in we received no tax benefit in the year ended due a full valuation allowance against the tax benefits of the stock based compensation

sfas no 
r requires a company to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies recognized subsequent to adopting sfas no

valuation of accounts receivable estimates are used in determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and are based on our historical collection experience  historical write offs  current trends  and the credit quality of our customer base and the characteristics of our accounts receivable by aging category 
if the allowance for doubtful accounts were to be understated  our operating income could be significantly reduced 
the impact of any such change or deviation may be increased by our reliance on a relatively small number of customers for a large portion of our total revenue 
as of december   three customers represented  and of our gross accounts receivable balance 
as of december   three customers represented  and of our gross accounts receivable balance 
valuation of inventories we record a provision for obsolete or excess inventory for systems and components that are no longer manufactured  or are at risk of being replaced with new versions of our product 
in determining the allowance for obsolete or excess inventory  we look at our forecasted demand versus quantities on hand and commitments 
any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and commitments and our reported results 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs  provision for purchase commitments and charges against earnings may be required  which would negatively affect our operating results for such period

comparison of and revenue total revenue increased by in to million from million for the increase in total revenue in relative to was primarily due to the licensing revenue of million from sony corporation  sony computer entertainment  inc and others  compared to no license revenue in the proceeds of our intellectual property licensing efforts tend to be sporadic and difficult to predict  which is expected to continue to contribute to the volatility of our financial condition and operating results

from time to time  we may be required to raise additional funds through public or private financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
there can be no assurance that such funding  if needed  will be available on terms attractive to us  or at all 
furthermore  any additional debt or equity financing arrangements may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
strategic arrangements  if necessary to raise additional funds  may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies or products 
our failure to raise capital when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force issued eitf no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf  which clarifies diversity in practice on the presentation of different types of taxes in the financial statements 
the task force concluded that  for taxes within the scope of the issue  a company may adopt a policy of presenting taxes either gross within revenue or net 
that is  it may include charges to customers for taxes within revenues and the charge for the taxes from the taxing authority within cost of sales  or  alternatively  it may net the charge to the customer and the charge from the taxing authority 
if taxes subject to this issue are significant  a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amounts of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis 
the guidance in this consensus is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after december  we are currently assessing the impact  if any  that the adoption of this eitf will have on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
 which became effective for us on january  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for income tax benefits that are uncertain in nature 
under fin no 
 a company will recognize a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management s assessment is that its position is more likely than not ie  a greater than percent likelihood to be upheld on audit based only on the technical merits of the tax position 
this accounting interpretation also provides guidance on measurement methodology  derecognition thresholds  financial statement classification and disclosures  interest and penalties recognition  and accounting for the cumulative effect adjustment 
the new interpretation is intended to provide better financial statement comparability among companies 
required annual disclosures include a tabular reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits at the beginning and end of the period  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate  the amounts of interest and penalties recognized in the financial statements  any expected significant impacts from unrecognized tax benefits on the financial statements over the subsequent month reporting period  and a description of the tax years remaining to be examined in major tax jurisdictions 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we are currently assessing the impact  if any  that the adoption of fin no
