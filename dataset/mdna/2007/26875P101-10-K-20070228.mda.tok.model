common stock rights agreement 
on february   eog s board of directors board declared a dividend of one preferred share purchase right a right  and the agreement governing the terms of such rights  the rights agreement for each outstanding share of common stock  par value per share 
the board has adopted this rights agreement to protect shareholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics 
the dividend was distributed to the shareholders of record on february  in accordance with the rights agreement  each share of common stock issued in connection with the two for one stock split effective march   also had one right associated with it 
each right  expiring february   represents a right to buy from eog one hundredth of a share of series e junior participating preferred stock series e for  once the rights become exercisable 
this portion of a series e share will give the shareho lder approximately the same dividend  voting  and liquidation rights as would one share of common stock 
prior to exercise  the right does not give its holder any dividend  voting  or liquidation rights 
if issued  each one hundredth of a series e share i will not be redeemable  ii will entitle holders to quarterly dividend payments of per share  or an amount equal to the dividend paid on one share of common stock  whichever is greater  iii will entitle holders upon liquidation either to receive per share or an amount equal to the payment made on one share of common stock  whichever is greater  iv will have the same voting power as one share of common stock  and v if shares of eog s common stock are exchanged via merger  consolidation  or a similar transaction  will entitle holders to a per share payment equal to the payment made on one share of common stock 
the rights will not be exercisable until ten days after a public announcement that a person or group has become an acquiring person acquiring person by obtaining beneficial ownership of or more of eog s common stock  or if earlier  ten business days or a later date determined by eog s board before any person or group becomes an acquiring person after a person or group begins a tender or exchange offer which  if consummated  would result in that person or group becoming an acquiring person 
on february   the rights agreement was amended to create an exception to the definition of acquiring person to permit a qualified institutional investor to hold or more  but less than  of eog s common stock without being deemed an acquiring person if the institutional investor meets the following requirements i the institutional investor is described in rule d b promulgated under the securities exchange act of and is eligible to report and  if such institutional investor is the beneficial owner of greater than of eog s common stock  does in fact report beneficial ownership of common stock on schedule g  ii the institutional investor is not required to file a schedule d or any successor or comparable report with respect to its beneficial ownership of eog s common stock  iii the institutional investor does not beneficially own or more of eog s common stock including in such calculation the holdings of all of the institutional investor s affiliates and associates other than those which  under published interpretations of the united states securities and exchange commission or its staff  are eligible to file separate reports on schedule g with respect to their beneficial ownership of eog s common stock  and iv the institutional investor does not beneficially own or more of eog s common stock including in such calculation the holdings of all of the institutional investor s affiliates and associates 
on june   the rights agreement was amended again to revise the exception to the definition of acquiring person to permit a qualified institutional investor to hold or more but less than of eog s common stock without being deemed an acquiring person if the institutional investor meets the other requirements of the definition of qualified institutional investor described in the amendment 
if a person or group becomes an acquiring person  all holders of rights  except the acquiring person may  for  purchase shares of eog s common stock with a market value of based on the market price of the common stock prior to such acquisition 
if eog is later acquired in a merger or similar transaction after the rights become exercisable  all holders of rights except the acquiring person may  for  purchase shares of the acquiring corporation with a market value of based on the market price of the acquiring corporation s stock prior to such merger 
eog s board may redeem the rights for per right at any time before any person or group becomes an acquiring person 
if the board redeems any rights  it must redeem all of the rights 
once the rights are redeemed  the only right of the holders of rights will be to receive the redemption price of per right 
the redemption price has been adjusted for the two for one stock split effective march  and will be adjusted for any future stock split or stock dividends of eog s common stock 
after a person or group becomes an acquiring person  but before an acquiring person owns or more of eog s outstanding common stock  the board may exchange the rights for common stock or equivalent security at an exchange ratio of one share of common stock or an equivalent security for each such right  other than rights held by the acquiring person

item a 
risk factors our business faces many risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face 
additional risks that we do not yet know of  or that we currently think are immaterial  may also impair our business operations or financial results 
if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs  our business  financial condition or results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
a substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material adverse effect on us 
prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely 
since we are primarily a natural gas company  we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil  condensate or natural gas liquids 
among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are the level of consumer demand  weather conditions  domestic drilling activity  the price and availability of alternative fuels  including liquefied natural gas  the proximity to  and capacity of  transportation facilities  worldwide economic and political conditions  the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures  and the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation 
our cash flow and earnings depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil 
prolonged or substantial declines in these commodity prices may adversely affect our liquidity  the amount of cash flow we have available for capital expenditures and our ability to maintain our credit quality and access to the credit and capital markets 
our ability to sell our crude oil and natural gas production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing 
the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including the availability  proximity and capacity of pipelines  natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities 
any significant change in market factors affecting these infrastructure facilities or our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 
we deliver crude oil and natural gas through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own 
these facilities may be temporarily unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical reasons  or may not be available to us in the future 
weather and climate may have a significant impact on our revenues and productivity 
demand for natural gas and oil is  to a significant degree  dependent on weather and climate  which impacts the price we receive for the commodities we produce 
in addition  our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by severe weather  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged equipment 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in our underlying assumptions could cause the quantities of our reserves to be misstated 
estimating quantities of proved crude oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions or changes of conditions could cause the quantities of our reserves to be overstated or understated 
to prepare estimates of economically recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows  we analyze many variable factors  such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas 
we also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data  and the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and excise taxes  capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs 
actual results most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could reduce our estimated quantities and present value of reserves 
if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves  our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 
the rate of production from crude oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration and development activities  acquire additional properties containing proved reserves  or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
future crude oil and natural gas production is  therefore  highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves 
drilling crude oil and natural gas wells is a high risk activity and subjects us to a variety of factors that we cannot control 
drilling crude oil and natural gas wells  including development wells  involves numerous risks  including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive crude oil and natural gas reservoirs 
we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 
the presence of unanticipated pressures or irregularities in formations  miscalculations or accidents may cause our drilling activities to be unsuccessful and result in a total loss of our investment 
in addition  we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and operating wells 
further  our drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements  which may increase our costs or restrict our activities  costs of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs  tubular materials and equipment  lack of infrastructure  and lack of trained drilling personnel 
we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations  especially regulations relating to environmental protection  and could incur even greater costs in the future 
our exploration  production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state and local levels  as well as by other governments authorities in countries in which we do business 
we have and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental and other regulations 
further  the crude oil and natural gas industry regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase these costs 
as an owner or lessee and operator of oil and gas properties  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign regulations relating to discharge of materials into  and protection of  the environment 
these regulations may  among other things  impose liability on us for the cost of pollution clean up resulting from operations  subject us to liability for pollution damages  and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas 
changes in or additions to regulations regarding the protection of the environment could hurt our business 
we do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities 
the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas can be hazardous  involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts  cratering  fires and loss of well control  which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities  injure or kill people  and damage property and the environment 
offshore operations are subject to usual marine perils  including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions  and governmental regulations as well as interruption or termination by governmental authorities based on environmental and other considerations 
we maintain insurance against many  but not all  potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts that we believe to be prudent 
losses and liabilities arising from such events could reduce our revenues and increase our costs to the extent not covered by insurance 
the occurrence of any of these events and any costs incurred as a result of such events and the liabilities related thereto  would reduce the funds available for exploration  drilling and production and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting from price increases and may expose us to other risks 
from time to time  we use derivative instruments primarily collars and price swaps to hedge the impact of market fluctuations of natural gas and crude oil prices on net income and cash flow 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities  we may be prevented from realizing the benefits of price increases above the levels of the hedges 
in addition  we are subject to risks associated with differences in prices at different locations  particularly where transportation constraints restrict our ability to deliver oil and gas volumes to the delivery point to which the hedging transaction is indexed 
if we acquire oil and gas properties  our failure to fully identify potential problems  to properly estimate reserves or production rates or costs  or to effectively integrate the acquired operations could seriously harm us 
from time to time  we seek to acquire oil and gas properties 
although we perform reviews of acquired properties that we believe are consistent with industry practices  reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor do they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and potential 
even when problems with a property are identified  we often assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties 
actual results may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
in addition  acquisitions may have adverse effects on our operating results  particularly during the periods in which the operations of acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations 
terrorist activities and military and other actions could adversely affect our business 
terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks  whether domestic or foreign  as well as the military or other actions taken in response to these acts  cause instability in the global financial and energy markets 
the united states government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
these actions could adversely affect us in unpredictable ways  including the disruption of fuel supplies and markets  increased volatility in crude oil and natural gas prices  or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terror 
competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense  and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 
we compete with major integrated and other independent oil and gas companies for acquisition of oil and gas leases  properties and reserves  equipment and labor required to explore  develop and operate those properties and the marketing of crude oil and natural gas production 
higher recent crude oil and natural gas prices have increased the costs of properties available for acquisition and there are a greater number of companies with the financial resources to pursue acquisition opportunities 
many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially larger than those we possess and have established strategic long term positions and maintain strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry 
as a consequence  we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights 
in addition  many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for crude oil and natural gas production  such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production  the cost and availability of alternative fuels and the application of government regulations 
we also compete in attracting and retaining personnel  including geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other specialists 
we have substantial capital requirements  and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  development  production  exploration and abandonment of our oil and gas reserves 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations  commercial paper and to a lesser extent and if necessary  bank borrowings  public and private equity and debt offerings 
lower crude oil and natural gas prices  however  would reduce our cash flow 
further  if the condition of the capital markets materially declines  we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable 
in addition  a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment

unresolved staff comments none 
item properties oil and gas exploration and production properties and reserves reserve information 
for estimates of eog s net proved and proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids  including crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids  see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers normally vary 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately re covered 
the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based 
in general  production from eog s oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves or conducts successful exploration  exploitation and development activities  the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced 
volumes generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves and the costs incurred in so doing 
eog s estimates of reserves filed with other federal agencies agree with the information set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements

eog operates under a consistent business and operational strategy that focuses predominantly on achieving a strong reinvestment rate of return  drilling internally generated prospects  delivering long term production growth and maintaining a strong balance sheet 
net income available to common for of  million was up compared to net income available to common of  million 
at december   eog s total reserves were trillion cubic feet equivalent  an increase of billion cubic feet equivalent bcfe from december  operations several important developments have occurred since january  united states and canada 
eog s effort to identify plays with larger reserve potential has proven a successful supplement to its base development and exploitation program in the united states and canada 
eog plans to continue to drill numerous wells in large acreage plays  which in the aggregate are expected to contribute substantially to eog s crude oil and natural gas production 
production in the united states and canada accounted for approximately of total company production in both and based on current trends  eog expects its production profile to be similar 
eog s major producing areas are in louisiana  new mexico  oklahoma  texas  utah  wyoming and western canada 
international 
although eog continues to focus on united states and canada natural gas  eog sees an increasing linkage between united states and canada natural gas demand and trinidad natural gas supply 
for example  liquefied natural gas lng imports from existing and planned facilities in trinidad are contenders to meet increasing united states natural gas demand 
in addition  ammonia  methanol and chemical production has been relocating from the united states and canada to trinidad  driven by attractive natural gas feedstock prices in the island nation 
eog believes that its existing position with the supply contracts to two ammonia plants  a methanol plant and the atlantic lng train alng plant will continue to give its portfolio an even broader exposure to united states and canada natural gas fundamentals 
beginning december  alng began taking start up gas and remained in the start up phase through december in the first quarter of  a subsidiary of eog  eog resources trinidad block a unlimited  drilled two successful wells on block a 
the subsidiary obtained approval to develop block a under a production sharing contract with the government of trinidad and tobago signed in july a subsidiary of eog  eog resources trinidad limited  and the other participants in the south east coast consortium secc block signed a farm out agreement covering the secc deep ibis prospect with bp trinidad and tobago llc bp during the secc deep ibis well spud in april  was drilled to a depth of approximately  feet and was abandoned and classified as a dry hole in the third quarter of bp paid the entire cost for drilling the secc deep ibis exploratory well 
during  notwithstanding difficulties in accessing rig slots in the southern gas basin of the united kingdom north sea  arthur was drilled and completed and began producing in early third quarter 
in addition to eog s ongoing production from valkyrie and arthur fields  eog participated in the drilling and successful testing of the columbus prospect in the central north sea block f 
the columbus well was a farm in opportunity  and its future appraisal and development is currently being evaluated 
capital structure one of management s key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to those in eog s peer group 
at december   eog s debt to total capitalization ratio was  down from at year end by primarily utilizing cash on hand and cash provided from its operating activities  eog funded its  million exploration and development expenditures  paid down million of debt  paid dividends to common shareholders of million and redeemed million of preferred stock 
as management continues to assess price forecast and demand trends for  eog believes that operations and capital expenditure activity can be largely funded by cash from operations 
for  eog s estimated exploration and development expenditure budget is approximately billion  excluding acquisitions 
united states and canada natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures 
when it fits eog s strategy  eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration and or production opportunities 
management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eog s history 
on september   eog filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on form s new registration statement for the offer and sale from time to time of up to  of eog s debt securities  preferred stock and common stock 
the new registration statement was filed to replace eog s existing shelf registration statement declared effective by the securities and exchange commission sec in october  under which eog had sold no securities 
as of february   the entire amount registered remains available under the new registration statement 
on october   eog commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of the  outstanding shares of the fixed rate cumulative perpetual senior preferred stock  series b  with a  liquidation preference per share series b  at a price of  per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the date of purchase 
the tender offer expired on november   and on november   eog redeemed  shares of the series b for an aggregate purchase price  including redemption premium  fees and dividends  of million

the change in per unit rates of lease and well  transportation costs  dd a  g a  taxes other than income and net interest expense for as compared to were due primarily to the reasons set forth below 
lease and well expenses include expenses for eog operated properties  as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property 
lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain eog s oil and natural gas wells  the cost of workovers  and lease and well administrative expenses 
operating and maintenance expenses include  among other things  pumping services  salt water disposal  equipment repair and maintenance  compression expense  lease upkeep  and fuel and power 
workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 
each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient  safe and environmentally responsible operations 
eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas 
operating costs within these existing and new areas  as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors  fluctuate over time 
lease and well expenses of million in were million higher than due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses in the united states million and canada million  higher lease and well administrative expenses million  including stock based compensation expense million  changes in the canadian exchange rate million  and higher workover expenditures in the united states million 
transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by eog from third party carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a down stream point of sale 
transportation costs include the cost of compression compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements  dehydration removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements  gathering fees  fuel costs and transportation fees 
transportation costs of million in were million higher than due primarily to increased production in the fort worth basin barnett shale play 
dd a of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
eog s dd a rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations 
there are several factors that can impact eog s composite dd a rate and expense  such as field production profiles  drilling or acquisition of new wells  disposition of existing wells  reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance  and impairments 
changes to these factors may cause eog s composite dd a rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year 
dd a expenses of million in were million higher than primarily due to higher unit rates described below and as a result of increased production in the united states million and trinidad million  partially offset by a decrease in production in the united kingdom million 
dd a rates increased due primarily to a gradual proportional increase in production from higher cost properties in the united states million and canada million  and a downward reserve revision in the united kingdom million 
the canadian exchange rate also contributed to the dd a expense increase million 
g a expenses of million in were million higher than due primarily to higher employee related costs million and higher insurance costs million 
the increase in employee related costs primarily reflects higher stock based compensation expenses million 
taxes other than income include severance production taxes  ad valorem property taxes  payroll taxes  franchise taxes and other miscellaneous taxes 
taxes other than income of million in were million higher than severance taxes in the united states decreased primarily due to increased credits taken for texas high cost gas severance tax rate reductions million 
severance production taxes in trinidad increased due primarily to increased wellhead revenues from crude oil and condensate million  partially offset by changes to the tax legislation governing the supplemental petroleum tax million 
ad valorem property taxes increased primarily due to higher property valuation in the united states million and canada million 
net interest expense of million in decreased million compared to primarily due to lower average debt balance million  costs in associated with the early retirement of the notes due million  and higher capitalized interest million 
exploration costs of million in were million higher than due primarily to higher employee related costs  including stock based compensation expenses 
impairments include amortization of unproved leases  as well as impairments under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires an entity to compute impairments to the carrying value of long lived assets based on future cash flow analysis 
impairments of million in were million higher than due primarily to increased sfas no

the estimated fair value of eog s debt at december  and was million and  million  respectively 
the estimated fair value was based upon quoted market prices and  where such prices were not available  upon interest rates available to eog at year end 
eog s debt is primarily at fixed interest rates 
at december   a decline in interest rates would result in a million increase in the estimated fair value of the fixed rate obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
during and  eog utilized cash provided by operating activities and commercial paper to fund its operations 
while eog maintains a million commercial paper program  the maximum outstanding at any time during was million  and the amount outstanding at year end was zero 
eog considers this excess availability  which is backed by the million revolving credit agreement with domestic and foreign lenders described in note to consolidated financial statements  combined with approximately million of availability under its shelf registration described below  to be ample to meet its ongoing operating needs 
during  eog repaid the million  notes due in primarily with cash generated from operating activities 
in  a foreign subsidiary of eog repaid million of the million borrowed in see note to consolidated financial statements 
the foreign subsidiary has the option to pay off the remaining million of the million borrowed in at any time prior to maturity 
eog plans to replace the million  notes due with other long term debt 
on october   eog commenced a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of the  outstanding shares of the fixed rate cumulative perpetual senior preferred stock  series b  with a  liquidation preference per share series b  at a price of  per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends up to the date of purchase 
the tender offer expired on november   and on november   eog redeemed  shares of the series b for an aggregate purchase price  including redemption premium  fees and dividends  of million 
eog has included as a component of preferred dividends the million of premium and fees associated with the redemption of the series b shares

in addition  this table does not include eog s pension or postretirement benefit obligations see note to consolidated financial statements 
amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december  management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog 
amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services 
shelf registration on september   eog filed an automatically effective shelf registration statement on form s new registration statement for the offer and sale from time to time of up to  of eog s debt securities  preferred stock and common stock 
the new registration statement was filed to replace eog s existing shelf registration statement declared effective by the sec in october  under which eog had sold no securities 
as of february   the entire amount registered remains available under the new registration statement 
off balance sheet arrangements eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships 
such entities  often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe  are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other off balance sheet arrangements during any of the reporting periods in this document and has no intention to participate in such transactions or arrangements in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency exchange rate risk during  eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries  including canada  trinidad and the united kingdom 
the foreign currency most significant to eog s operations during was the canadian dollar 
the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in impacted both the revenues and expenses of eog s canadian subsidiaries 
however  since the canadian natural gas prices are largely correlated to united states prices  the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses 
eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
effective march   eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note to consolidated financial statements 
eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas nos 
 and under those provisions  as of december   eog recorded the fair value of the swap of million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income available to common on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of million for the year ended de cember  this amount is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
outlook natural gas prices historically have been volatile  and this volatility is expected to continue 
uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future united states and canada natural gas and crude oil price trends  and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry 
being primarily a natural gas producer  eog is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate prices 
longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels  such as oil and coal 
assuming a totally unhedged position for  based on eog s tax position and the portion of eog s anticipated natural gas volumes for for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts  eog s price sensitivity for each per mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately million for net income and operating cash flow 
eog s price sensitivity in for each per barrel change in wellhead crude oil price is approximately million for net income and operating cash flow 
for information regarding eog s natural gas and crude oil hedge position as of december   see note to consolidated financial statements 
eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada 
however  in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio and as a result of its overall success realized in trinidad and the united kingdom north sea  eog anticipates expending a portion of its available funds in the further development of opportunities outside the united states and canada 
in addition  eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities 
budgeted exploration and development expenditures  excluding acquisitions  are approximately billion and are structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eog s strategy of funding its exploration  development  exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow 
the level of exploration and development expenditures may vary in and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
based upon existing economic and market conditions  eog believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year 
however  eog has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant 
while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states  canada  trinidad and the united kingdom  such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog 
environmental regulations various foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  affect eog s operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration  development and production operations and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances  including crude oil  into the environment 
in addition  eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eog s control 
under environmental laws and regulations  eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators 
in addition  eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator 
compliance with such laws and regulations increases eog s overall cost of business  but has not had a material adverse effect on eog s operations or financial condition 
it is not anticipated  based on current laws and regulations  that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations but  inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed  eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
eog also could incur costs related to the clean up of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning  and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 
summary of critical accounting policies eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on  among other things  their impact on the portrayal of eog s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  and the degree of difficulty  subjectivity and complexity in their deployment 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
management routinely discusses the development  selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies 
following is a discussion of eog s most critical accounting policies proved oil and gas reserves eog s engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves  which directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic cond itions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
oil and gas exploration costs oil and gas exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production  a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the gulf of mexico 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed 
such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability o f the project is being made 
as of december  and  eog had exploratory drilling costs related to two projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note to consolidated financial statements 
these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil  are capitalized 
impairments oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a property by property basis  and any impairment in value is recognized 
unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated  and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive  based on historical experience  is amortized over the average holding period 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
lease rentals are expensed as incurred 
when circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired  eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on eog s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depletion  depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
with respect to lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs  the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
certain other assets are depreciated on a straight line basis 
assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition  such as a reservoir or field 
amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs  reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions  property acquisitions and or property dispositions  and impairments 
stock based compensation effective january   eog accounts for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires a public entity to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award  eliminating the exception to account for such awards using the intrinsic method previously allowable under apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
in applying the provisions of sfas r  judgments and estimates are made regarding  among other things  the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies 
assumptions regarding expected volatility of eog s common stock  the level of risk free interest rates  expected dividend yields on eog s stock  the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change 
any such changes cou ld result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income
