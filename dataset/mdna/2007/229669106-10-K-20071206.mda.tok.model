item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our two primary businesses are in the defense and transportation industries 
for the year ended september   of sales were derived from defense  while were derived from transportation fare collection systems and other commercial operations 
these are high technology businesses that design  manufacture and integrate complex systems to meet the needs of various federal and regional government agencies in the us and other nations around the world 
the us government remains our largest customer  accounting for approximately of sales in compared to in and in our defense segment is organized into three market focused business units readiness systems formerly known as training systems business unit rsbu  mission support services business unit msbu  and communications electronics business unit cebu 
the segment is a diversified supplier of constructive  live and virtual military training systems  services and communication systems and products to the us department of defense  other government agencies and allied nations 
we design instrumented range systems for fighter aircraft  armored vehicles and infantry force on force live training  weapons effects simulations  laser based tactical and communication systems  and precision gunnery solutions 
our services are focused on training mission support  computer simulation training  distributed interactive simulation  development of military training doctrine  force modernization services for nato entrants and field operations and maintenance 
our communications products are aimed at intelligence  surveillance  and search and rescue markets 
the segment also has a interest in a joint venture which produces components of advanced tactical systems for the us and israel 
cubic transportation systems develops and delivers innovative fare collection systems for public transit authorities worldwide 
we provide hardware  software and multiagency  multimodal transportation integration technologies and services that allow the agencies to efficiently collect fares  manage their operations  reduce shrinkage and make using public transit a more convenient and attractive option for commuters 
consolidated overview sales in fiscal increased by to million compared to million in sales in had increased over sales of million 
sales growth in the three year period from to all came from our defense segment  while transportation systems sales trended slightly downward during the three year period 
nearly all the growth in defense sales was organic  coming from existing subsidiaries  with an immaterial amount coming from a small strategic acquisition we made in see the segment discussions following for further analysis of segment sales 
operating income doubled in fiscal to million from million in  after having more than doubled in from million in the improvement in came from both segments with transportation systems increasing significantly from a low level in and defense improving by more than 
in fiscal the primary reason for the improvement was that our transportation business returned to profitability after having incurred an operating loss in fiscal defense operating income also increased in  at a slightly better rate than the growth in defense sales 
see the segment discussions following for further details of segment operating results 
net income increased in fiscal to million per share from million 
per share in net income in had more than doubled from million per share in included in was a gain on the sale of our corrugated box business in the fourth quarter of approximately million  after applicable income taxes 
we had owned this small business since the s and over the years realized a high rate of return on our investment  however  in recent years competition and raw material prices had driven profit margins down 
since this business is not a part of our core mission  we determined that it was time for us to divest it 
approximately million  after applicable income taxes  of the net income was from a gain on the sale of real estate that had been held for investment purposes for many years  but was sold in the first fiscal quarter of reductions in tax contingency reserves accounted for approximately million  million and million  respectively  of the  and net income 
the gross margin from product sales improved again in to from in  due to improved performance from our defense readiness systems business and the transportation systems segment 
the gross margin for product sales had been down to in  as a result of cost growth in the transportation systems segment that year 
the gross margin from service sales was in  compared to in and in the primary cause of the decreasing service gross margin during the three year period was lower sales from a service contract in europe that had generated higher than average gross margins 
this contract was completed in the second quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative sg a expenses decreased to of sales in compared to in and in sg a expenses decreased in  to million compared to million in sg a increased in the defense segment due to somewhat higher selling expenses and due to growth of the business  while sg a decreased in the transportation segment due to cost cutting measures 
in sg a expenses had decreased million from the level  with the decrease coming from both segments 
in  the defense segment had incurred higher than normal selling expenses related to contract proposals  while such activities returned to a more normal level in lower transportation systems selling expenses and staffing reductions contributed to reduced sg a expenses in in addition  an allowance for doubtful accounts provision of more than million had contributed to higher sg a expenses in transportation systems in company sponsored research and development r d spending decreased to million in  compared to million in and million our r d spending continues to be incurred primarily in connection with customer funded activities 
we do not rely heavily on company sponsored r d  as most of our new product development occurs in conjunction with the performance of work on our contracts 
the amount of contract required development activity in was million  compared to million in and million in  however  these costs are included in cost of sales as they are directly related to contract performance 
interest and dividend income increased in over both and due primarily to higher available cash balances for investment 
other income increased in over as a result of foreign currency exchange gains on advances to our foreign subsidiaries 
other income had decreased in compared to in part because of lower rental income  resulting from the sale of the real estate mentioned above 
other income in had also included foreign currency exchange gains on advances to foreign subsidiaries 
interest expense decreased nearly million in compared to and because of a reduction in both short and long term borrowings 
our effective tax rate for was of pretax income compared to in and in our effective rate in increased in part because we recorded a provision of million for us taxes on a million pound million dividend from our uk subsidiary that was paid in in december  the us congress reinstated the research and experimentation r e credit retroactive to january  as a result  we recorded a tax benefit of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal that represents the estimated r e credit for the nine month period ended september   which was not previously reflected in our operating results 
tax expense in had included a provision of million for taxes due upon the repatriation of capital to the us from our us subsidiary during the year 
the effective rate in  and benefited from the reversal of tax contingency provisions amounting to million  million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rate could be affected in future years by  among other factors  the mix of business between us and foreign jurisdictions  our ability to take advantage of available tax credits  and audits of our records by taxing authorities 
defense segment years ended september  in millions defense segment sales mission support services msbu readiness systems rsbu communications and electronics cebu tactical systems and other defense segment operating income mission support services msbu readiness systems rsbu communications and electronics cebu tactical systems and other as depicted in the table above  sales from our defense segment increased to million in  compared to million in sales in had increased from sales of million 
higher sales in came from rsbu and msbu  while sales from cebu decreased in comparison to in sales from cebu had increased from the level  while sales from the other defense business units grew only slightly 
the caption tactical systems and other in the table above includes operating results of our owned joint venture company as well as advanced programs for the development of new defense technologies 
operating income in our defense segment increased to million in from million in  a increase 
in  operating income had increased from operating income of million 
growth in operating income came from rsbu and msbu  while cebu generated an operating loss for the year 
the increase in operating income was primarily due to a turnaround to profitability from cebu  which had incurred an operating loss in msbu operating income increased in  while rsbu operating income decreased by nearly 
the joint venture company incurred operating losses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  although we expect its performance to improve in as its revenues increase 
mission support services msbu msbu sales increased in  after having increased in from the level 
the increase in sales came from the expansion of existing programs and from new contracts won in sales were higher by nearly million from the joint readiness training center jrtc contract in fort polk  la  due to an increase in training exercises conducted by the customer 
in addition  increased activity from our contract with the marine corp 
and higher sales from contracts for modeling the effects of weapons of mass destruction added to sales 
sales growth in was limited by a reduction of training exercises at the jrtc that decreased sales from that program by about million 
the most significant growth in sales came from contracts for modeling the effects of weapons of mass destruction 
operating income from msbu increased in after increasing in higher sales volume and award fees helped to increase profitability in and improved operating income as a percentage of sales to  compared to in and in the most significant increases in operating income came from the marine corp 
and jrtc contracts mentioned above 
in a change in the mix of sales to higher profit margin programs helped to improve operating income despite limited sales growth 
readiness systems rsbu rsbu sales increased in over after having increased only slightly in from most of the increase in sales compared to came from air combat training systems  while ground combat training and small arms virtual training systems sales grew slightly 
work continued on the air combat training system contract known as p and on a contract for an australian air combat training system 
we are also working on ground combat training ranges in canada  the far east and middle east 
in  sales of air combat training systems were also higher when compared to  while both small arms training systems and ground combat training systems sales decreased slightly 
rsbu operating income nearly doubled in from  back to a level comparable to the increase in came from higher profit margins on higher sales of air combat training systems and improvements in profitability of ground combat training systems and small arms training systems 
higher profit margins from a ground combat training system in the far east were offset by cost growth of more than million on a ground combat training system in the middle east  while operating income from other ground combat training systems improved slightly 
operating income from small arms training systems improved in as the development of new weapons simulations systems was completed in  resulting in decreased costs  and because sales increased in the primary reason for decreased operating income in was cost growth of million on a contract for the development of a ground combat training system in canada  in addition to the small arms training development costs of million mentioned above 
lower sales of small arms training systems further impacted operating income from this product line 
communications and electronics cebu sales from cebu decreased in  after having increased in from the level 
sales increased in from a contract for the supply of data links for unmanned aerial vehicles in the uk  however  this increase was more than offset by decreases in other data link sales 
several of the data link contracts that had resulted in the sales growth in neared completion in sales of personnel locator systems and power amplifiers also decreased in  after having increased in cebu generated an operating loss of million in due primarily to cost growth of million on a contract for the development of new data link technology 
profit margins on other data link contracts were also lower  however  this decrease was partially offset by improved profit margins from sales of power amplifiers and personnel locator systems 
in  operating income improved to million from the operating loss of million incurred in operating income in came primarily from the sale of power amplifiers and data links  in addition to the favorable settlement of a long standing dispute with a customer during the year  which added million to operating income 
the operating loss in communications and electronics in was primarily due to cost growth totaling nearly million on two contracts  one a program for the development of new data link technology and the other a program involving an intelligence application of our data link and receiver technology 
in addition  approximately million in overstocked or obsolete surveillance receiver inventory was written down in value to zero in transportation systems segment years ended september  in millions transportation segment sales transportation segment operating income transportation systems sales continued the downward trend of recent years in  decreasing from the level 
sales in north america and sweden decreased in compared to  while sales in australia and the uk increased 
several system installation contracts in north america were either complete or neared completion in  resulting in decreased sales  while progress on a contract in sweden was slowed due to cost growth  also resulting in lower sales in than in sales in australia increased due in part to a settlement reached with the customer during the year that increased the value of the contract 
in the u 
k sales were lower from a service contract that was phased out because old ticket issuing equipment was replaced by modern equipment requiring less maintenance  however  this decrease was more than offset by higher sales from other uk contracts  including the prestige contract in london 
a major contributor to the increase in uk sales was the strength of the british pound against the uk dollar  resulting in the dollar value of sales in the uk increasing million for the year when compared to average exchange rates experienced in in increased sales from a contract in sweden helped to offset a decrease in sales from the prestige contract and from uk service contracts 
service sales were lower in the uk in primarily because of the gradual phase out of ticket issuing equipment mentioned above 
in addition  we completed a contract for the maintenance of communications equipment in london at the end of fiscal which was not renewed in  further impacting service sales 
operating income in the transportation systems segment improved significantly in from the low level of settlements were reached with three customers  adding million to operating income  however  we also added million to our estimate of costs to complete two of these contracts  yielding a net improvement to operating income of million from these contract settlements 
operating income from the prestige contract in london increased more than million compared to last year  including bonuses earned for system usage and the effect of a higher currency exchange rate 
currency exchange differences resulted in an improvement in operating income of about million from all uk contracts  when comparing the average exchange rate to the rate 
cost growth on north american system installation contracts in was about million this year compared to approximately million last year  helping to improve operating income 
lower operating income from the uk service contract mentioned above and from spare parts sales in the us partially offset these improvements 
in addition  cost growth from a contract in sweden totaling more than million for the year also impacted operating income 
higher legal fees in further reduced operating income for the year by million when compared to in  improved operating income from contracts in europe was partially offset by operating losses on contracts in north america and australia 
projected costs to complete fare collection systems on several north american and one australian contract increased by approximately million more than had been previously estimated 
the primary cause of the cost growth was an increase in engineering hours incurred to complete the projects  in addition to project management costs incurred due to delays in project completion 
this compares to cost growth of approximately million on these contracts in in we also recorded an allowance of million for doubtful collection of an accounts receivable balance with a customer that terminated its contract with us 
this provision is included in sg a expenses in the consolidated statement of income 
we believe that we have substantially performed the requirements of the contract such that this payment is due to us and we believe the termination attempt by this customer is unwarranted 
backlog september  in millions total backlog transportation systems defense mission support services readiness systems communications and electronics tactical systems and other total defense total funded backlog transportation systems defense mission support services readiness systems communications and electronics tactical systems and other total defense total in addition to the amounts identified above  the company has been selected as a participant in or  in some cases  the sole contractor for several substantial indefinite delivery indefinite quantity idiq contracts 
idiq contracts are not included in backlog until an order is received 
included in the transportation systems backlog at september  is million from to the prestige fare collection system contract with tfl  through our joint venture company  transys 
of this amount million relates to the last five years of the contract from august through august that is subject to a termination for convenience clause in the contract 
this termination clause outlines the obligations of the customer should they elect to exercise this contract provision  including penalty payments to transys and early payment of the debt  among other requirements 
because of these onerous requirements  we do not believe it would be in the best interests of tfl to terminate the contract early  however  they may do so 
the contract is now in its tenth year and the customer must notify transys by october if they should elect to terminate the contract 
of the increase in transportation systems backlog between september  and september   approximately million was the result of strengthening of the british pound vs 
the us dollar between those dates 
the difference between total backlog and funded backlog represents options under multiyear service contracts 
funding for these contracts comes from annual operating budgets of the us government and the options are normally exercised annually 
options for the purchase of additional systems or equipment are not included in backlog until exercised 
new accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the purpose of fin is to clarify and set forth consistent rules for accounting for uncertain tax positions in accordance with sfas  accounting for income taxes 
the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation are required to be reported separately as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
we will implement this standard in the first quarter of fiscal  however  we are in the process of reviewing and evaluating fin  and therefore the ultimate impact of its adoption is not yet known 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework and gives guidance regarding the methods used for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
in september  the fasb published sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
sfas requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans to recognize the funded status of those plans in the balance sheet  measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end balance sheet and provide additional disclosures 
on september   we adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas the effect of adopting sfas on our financial condition at september  has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sfas did not have an effect on our financial condition at september  sfas s provisions regarding the change in measurement date of postretirement benefit plans are not applicable as we already use a measurement date of september for our pension plans 
see note for further discussion of the effect of adopting sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  this statement permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value at specified election dates 
subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be reported in earnings 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of sfas on our consolidated results of operations and financial position 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operations totaled million in  compared to million in and million in a decrease in accounts receivable in each of the three years amounting to million  million and million in  and  respectively  contributed to the positive cash flows 
all of the operating cash flows in came from the transportation systems segment  while defense cash flows were slightly negative for the year 
both the defense and transportation systems segments generated positive cash flows in and  with the larger amount contributed by transportation systems in and by defense in we have classified certain unbilled accounts receivable balances as noncurrent because we do not expect to receive payment within one year from the balance sheet date 
at september   this balance was million compared to million at september  cash flows used in investing activities in included million of capital expenditures  partially offset by proceeds of million from the sale of our corrugated box business 
during we also invested a net of million in financial instruments that are classified as short term investments 
investing activities in included capital expenditures of million  proceeds from the sale of investment real estate of million and the addition of million in short term investments 
in  investing activities included million of capital expenditures and the liquidation of million of short term investments 
financing activities in included the repayment of short term borrowings of million and scheduled payments on long term borrowings of million  in addition to the payment of a dividend to shareholders of million cents per share 
financing activities in included scheduled debt payments of million  repayment of short term borrowings of million and dividends to shareholders of million 
in we borrowed a net million on a short term basis to fund working capital requirements  made scheduled debt payments of million and paid dividends to shareholders of million 
accumulated other comprehensive income increased million in because of foreign currency translation adjustments of million and a decrease in the recorded liability for our pension plans of million 
this increases the positive balance in accumulated other comprehensive income to million as of september  compared to million at september  the pension plan under funded balance improved from the september  balance of million to million at september  this improvement in the funding position can be attributed primarily to a return on plan assets for the year that was higher than our assumed rate of return and to an increase in the discount rate we used to calculate the pension liability 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  which we implemented in fiscal  the under funded balance of million is reflected on the balance sheet as a liability at september  the net deferred tax asset decreased to million at september  compared to million at september  the primary reason for the decrease is that the effect of recording adjustments to the pension liability through other comprehensive income resulted in a deferred tax liability of million at september  compared to a deferred tax asset of million at september  we expect to generate sufficient taxable income in the future such that the net deferred tax asset will be realized 
our financial condition remains strong with working capital of million and a current ratio of to at september  we expect that cash on hand and our ability to access the debt markets will be adequate to meet our working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
in addition to the short term borrowing arrangements we have in the uk and new zealand  we have a committed five year credit facility from a group of financial institutions in the us  aggregating million 
as of september   million of this capacity was used for letters of credit  leaving an additional million available 
our total debt to capital ratio at september  was less than 
in addition  our cash and short term investments totaled million at september  which exceeded our total debt by million 
the following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding as of september  less than total year years years after years in millions long term debt interest payments operating leases deferred compensation critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments our financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  the most critical of which are those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  valuation of goodwill and p ension costs 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
besides the estimates identified above that are considered critical  we make many other accounting estimates in preparing our financial statements and related disclosures 
all estimates  whether or not deemed critical  affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and judgments are also based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
materially different results can occur as circumstances cha nge and additional information becomes known  even for estimates and judgments that are not deemed critical 
this discussion of critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments should be read in conjunction with other disclosures included in this discussion  and the notes to the consolidated financial statements related to estimates  contingencies and new accounting standards 
significant accounting policies are identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed each of the critical accounting policies and the related estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
font size face times new roman style font size pt  font style italic  revenue recognition a significant portion of our business is derived from long term development  production and system integration contracts which we account for consistent with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa audit and accounting guide  audits of federal government contractors  and the aicpa s statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we consider the nature of these contracts  and the types of products and services provided  when we determine the proper accounting for a particular contract 
generally  we record revenue for long term fixed price contracts on a percentage of completion basis using the cost to cost method to measure progress toward completion 
most of our long term fixed price contracts require us to deliver minimal quantities over a long period of time or to perform a substantial level of development effort in relation to the total value of the contract 
under the cost to cost method of accounting  we recognize revenue based on a ratio of the costs incurred to the estimated total costs at completion 
amounts representing contract change orders  claims or other items are included in the contract value only when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable 
provisions are made on a current basis to fully recognize any anticipated losses on contracts 
we record sales under cost reimbursement type contracts as we incur the costs 
incentives or penalties and awards applicable to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profits  and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated contract performance 
incentive provisions that increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are not recognized until the event occurs 
we have accounting policies in place to address these and other complex issues in accounting for long term contracts 
sales of products are recorded when a firm sales agreement is in place  delivery has occurred and collectibility of the fixed or determinable sales price is reasonably assured 
sales for fixed price service contracts that do not contain measurable units of work performed are generally recognized on straight line basis over the contractual service period  unless evidence suggests that the revenue is earned  or obligations fulfilled  in a different manner 
sales for fixed price service contracts that contain measurable units of work performed are recognized when the units of work are completed 
sales and profits on contracts that specify multiple deliverables are allocated to separate units of accounting when there is objective evidence that each accounting unit has value to the customer on a stand alone basis 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our income tax provisions and in evaluating our tax return positions 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  we believe that certain positions are likely to be challenged and that we may not prevail 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements and are referred to as timing differences 
in addition  some expenses are not deductible on our tax return and are referred to as permanent differences 
timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the benefit in our income statement 
we establish valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally repres ent deductions we have taken on our tax return but have not yet recognized as expense in our financial statements 
we have not recognized any united states tax expense on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since we intend to reinvest the earnings outside the us for the foreseeable future 
these undistributed earnings totaled approximately million at september  annually we evaluate the capital requirements in our foreign subsidiaries and determine the amount of excess capital  if any  that is available for distribution 
whether or not we actually repatriate the excess capital in the form of a dividend  we would provide for us taxes on the amount determined to be available for distribution 
this evaluation is judgmental in nature and  therefore  the amoun t of us taxes provided on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries is affected by these judgments 
based on this analysis in  we determined that million british pounds million was excess capital in the uk and paid a dividend of that amount to the uk parent company 
valuation of goodwill we evaluate our recorded goodwill balances for potential impairment annually by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value  including recorded goodwill 
we have not yet had a case where the carrying value exceeded the fair value  however  if it did  impairment would be measured by comparing the derived fair value of goodwill to its carrying value  and any impairment determined would be recorded in the current period 
to date there has been no impairment of our recorded goodwill 
goodwill balances by reporting unit are as follows september  in millions defense systems and products defense services transportation systems total goodwill determining the fair value of a reporting unit for purposes of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
we currently perform internal valuation analysis and consider other market information that is publicly available 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows and comparisons with recent transactions 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions including projected future cash flows  discount rate reflecting the inherent risk in future cash flows  perpetual growth rate and determination of appropriate market comparables 
for fiscal  the discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete three year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the three year discrete forecasts were estimated based on projected growth rates and financial ratios  influenced by an analysis of historical ratios  and by calculating a terminal value at the end of ten years 
the compound annual growth rates for sales ranged from to and for operating profit margins ranged from to for the reporting units  beyond the discrete forecast period 
the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of 
we did not recognize any goodwill impairment as a result of performing this annual test 
a variance in the discount rate  the estimated sales growth rate or the operating profit margin could have a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and consequently the amount of identified goodwill impairment 
for example  a decrease in the assumed operating profit margin in the defense systems and products reporting unit or a decrease in the assumed operating profit margin in the transportation systems reporting unit would have resulted in an indication of impairment that would have led us to further quantify the possible impairment and potentially record a charge to write down these assets 
pension costs the measurement of our pension obligations and costs is dependent on a variety of assumptions used by our actuaries 
these assumptions include estimates of the present value of projected future pension payments to plan participants  taking into consideration the likelihood of potential future events such as salary increases and demographic experience 
these assumptions may have an effect on the amount and timing of future contributions 
the assumptions used in developing the required estimates include the following key factors discount rates inflation salary growth expected return on plan assets retirement rates mortality rates we base the discount rate assumption on investment yields available at year end on high quality corporate long term bonds 
our inflation assumption is based on an evaluation of external market indicators 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience in relation to the inflation assumption 
the expected return on plan assets reflects asset allocations  our historical experience  our investment strategy and the views of investment managers and large pension sponsors 
retirement and mortality rates are based primarily on actual plan experience 
the effects of actual results differing from our assumptions are accumulated an d amortized over future periods  and therefore  generally affect our recognized expense in such future periods 
changes in the above assumptions can affect our financial statements  although the relatively small size of our defined benefit pension plans in relation to the size of the company limit the impact any individual assumption changes can have 
for example  a basis point change in the assumed rate of return on assets would have changed the pension expense recorded in by about million  before applicable income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk we invest in money market instruments and short term marketable debt and equity securities that are tied to floating interest rates being offered at the time the investment is made 
we maintain short term borrowing arrangements in the us  us and new zealand which are also tied to floating interest rates libor and the us prime rate and the uk and new zealand base rates 
we also have senior unsecured notes payable to insurance companies that are due in annual installments 
these notes have fixed coupon interest rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information 
interest income earned on our short term investments is affected by changes in the general level of us and us interest rates 
these income streams are generally not hedged 
interest expense incurred under the short term borrowing arrangements is affected by changes in the general level of interest rates in the us  us and new zealand 
the expense related to these cost streams is usually not hedged since it is either revolving  payable within three months and or immediately callable by the lender at any time 
interest expense incurred under the long term notes payable is not affected by changes in any interest rate because it is fixed 
however  we have in the past  and may in the future  use an interest rate swap to essentially convert this fixed rate into a floating rate for some or all of the long term debt outstanding 
the purpose of a swap would be to tie the interest expense risk related to these borrowings to the interest income risk on our short term investments  thereby mitigating our net interest rate risk 
we believe that we are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk at this point in time 
there was no interest rate swap outstanding at september foreign currency exchange risk in the ordinary course of business  we enter into firm sale and purchase commitments denominated in many foreign currencies 
we have a policy to hedge those commitments greater than  by using foreign currency exchange forward and option contracts that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary responsible for the commitment  typically the british pound  canadian dollar  euro  swedish krona  new zealand dollar and australian dollar 
these contracts are designed to be effective hedges regardless of the direction or magnitude of any foreign currency exchange rate change  because they result in an equal and opposite income or cost stream that offsets the change in the value of the underlying commitment 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more information on our foreign currency translation and transaction accounting policies 
we also use balance sheet hedges to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
this strategy involves incurring british pound denominated debt see interest rate risk above and having the option of paying off the debt using us dollar or british pound funds 
we do not believe that we are significantly exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk at this point in time 
investments in our foreign subsidiaries in the uk  australia  new zealand  and canada are not hedged because we consider them to be invested indefinitely 
in addition  we generally have control over the timing and amount of earnings repatriation  if any  and expect to use this control to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk
