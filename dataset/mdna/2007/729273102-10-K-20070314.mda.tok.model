item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a bank holding company for plumas bank  a california state chartered commercial bank 
we derive our income primarily from interest received on real estate related  commercial and consumer loans and  to a lesser extent  interest on investment securities  fees received in connection with servicing deposit and loan customers and fees from the sale or referral of loans 
our major operating expenses are the interest we pay on deposits and borrowings and general operating expenses 
we rely on locally generated deposits to provide us with funds for making loans 
we are subject to competition from other financial institutions and our operating results  like those of other financial institutions operating in california  are significantly influenced by economic conditions in california  including the strength of the real estate market 
in addition  both the fiscal and regulatory policies of the federal and state government and regulatory authorities that govern financial institutions and market interest rates also impact the bank s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
one of our strategic objectives is to expand our banking service activities in the truckee tahoe region and the adjacent communities 
consistent with this objective  in late we opened a de novo branch in tahoe city 
also in late  we bought five branches located within our existing service area from another community bank 
of the five branches purchased  two were located in the truckee tahoe region  specifically in the communities of truckee and kings beach 
this helped further strengthen our presence in this region 
in october  we completed construction and opened a new bank owned branch in truckee  california 
this replaced a much smaller leased facility 
during the fourth quarter of we opened a commercial real estate loan office in reno  nevada 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are integral to understanding the financial results reported 
our most complex accounting policies require management s judgment to ascertain the valuation of assets  liabilities  commitments and contingencies 
we have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure valuation methods are well controlled and applied consistently from period to period 
the following is a brief description of our current accounting policies involving significant management valuation judgments 
allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses represents our best estimate of losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is increased by the provision for loan losses charged to expense and reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
we evaluate our allowance for loan losses quarterly 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting estimate because it is based upon management s assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of the loans  including current economic conditions  past credit experience  delinquency status  the value of the underlying collateral  if any  and a continuing review of the portfolio of loans 
we determine the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses  primarily on an analysis of the various components of the loan portfolio  including all significant credits on an individual basis 
we segment the loan portfolio into as many components as practical 
each component has similar characteristics  such as risk classification  past due status  type of loan or lease  industry or collateral 

table of contents we cannot provide you with any assurance that economic difficulties or other circumstances which would adversely affect our borrowers and their ability to repay outstanding loans will not occur which would be reflected in increased losses in our loan portfolio  which could result in actual losses that exceed reserves previously established 
available for sale securities 
available for sale securities are required to be carried at fair value 
we believe this is a critical accounting estimate in that the fair value of a security is based on quoted market prices or if quoted market prices are not available  fair values are extrapolated from the quoted prices of similar instruments 
adjustments to the available for sale securities fair value impact the consolidated financial statements by increasing or decreasing assets and shareholders equity 
deferred income taxes 
deferred income taxes reflect the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the reported amount of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and such amounts as measured by tax laws and regulations 
we use an estimate of future earnings to support our position that the benefit of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
if future income should prove non existent or less than the amount of the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the asset may not be realized and our net income will be reduced 
impairment of core deposit intangible 
the core deposit intangible represents the excess of the premiums paid over the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired in the branch acquisitions 
the core deposit intangible is required to be amortized over its expected useful life and required to be evaluated for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the fair value of the asset is determined to be less than the carrying amount  the core deposit intangible will be written down through a charge to operations 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under sfas r  compensation cost is recognized for all awards that vest subsequent to the date of adoption based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and sfas r 
we believe this is a critical accounting estimate since the grant date fair value is estimated using the black scholes option pricing formula  which involves making estimates of the assumptions used  including the expected term of the option  expected volatility over the option term  expected dividend yield over the option term and risk free interest rate 
in addition  when determining the compensation expense to amortize over the vesting period  management makes estimates about the expected forfeiture rate of options 
the following discussion is designed to provide a better understanding of significant trends related to the company s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital resources and interest rate sensitivity 
it pertains to the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations as of december  and and for each of the three years in the period ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere herein

at december  investments securities totaled million  there were no federal funds sold and short term borrowings were million 
deposits declined by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  competition for deposit dollars throughout the company s service area  both from bank and non bank sources  and a lack of significant deposit growth in the company s service area have contributed to this decline in deposits

the evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio  overall portfolio quality  review of specific problem loans  and current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and ultimate losses may vary from the current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and  as adjustments become necessary  they are reported in earnings in the periods in which they become known 
see the sections titled asset quality and analysis of allowance for loan losses for further discussion of loan quality trends and the provision for loan losses 
the company recorded  in provision for loan losses for   for and  for the company has experienced a general strengthening in overall credit quality of the loan portfolio as evidenced by a decline in net charge offs as a percentage of average loans in and and a decline in nonperforming loans in compared to net charge offs as a percentage of average loans decreased to  or  from the level of

nonperforming loans decreased from million at december  to million at december  based on 
table of contents information currently available  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb potential risks in the portfolio 
however  no assurance can be given that the company may not sustain charge offs which are in excess of the allowance in any given period 
the company s loan portfolio composition and non performing assets are further discussed under the financial condition section that begins on page non interest income the following table sets forth the components of non interest income for the years ended december   and years ended december  change during year dollars in thousands service charges on deposit accounts earnings on bank owned life insurance policies merchant processing official check fees customer service fees investment services federal home loan bank dividends safe deposit box and night depository income printed check fee income gain on sale of loans  net loan commission and servicing fees loss gain on sale of investment securities  net other income total non interest income compared to during  total non interest income increased slightly by  or  to million  up from million from the comparable period in this increase was primarily related to an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of  thousand from the previous year

loan commissions and servicing fees declined by thousand from this decline primarily relates to an increase in the amortization of servicing assets and i o strips receivable 
declines of  in investment services income and  in merchant processing income were mostly offset by increases of  in earnings on life insurance policies and  in official check fees 
compared to during  total non interest income decreased slightly by  or  to million 
the decrease in non interest income was primarily the result of decreases in gains on sale of investments securities and loans and declines in earnings on bank owned life insurance policies partially offset by increases in merchant processing fees and service charges on deposit accounts 
the decrease in gains on sales of investment securities is primarily a result of the increase in short term interest rates in reducing opportunities to record gains on the sale of investment securities

financial condition loan portfolio 
the company continues to manage the mix of its loan portfolio consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financing needs of all sectors of the area it serves 
although the company offers a broad array of financing options  it continues to concentrate its focus on small to medium sized commercial businesses 
these commercial loans offer diversification as to industries and types of businesses  thus limiting material exposure in any industry concentrations 
the company offers both fixed and floating rate loans and obtains collateral in the form of real property  business assets and deposit accounts  but looks to business and personal cash flows as its primary source of repayment 
the company s largest lending categories are real estate mortgage loans  consumer and real estate construction loans 
these categories accounted for approximately  and  respectively of the company s total loan portfolio at december   and approximately  and  respectively of the company s total loan portfolio at december  in addition  the company s real estate related loans  including real estate mortgage loans  real estate construction loans  consumer equity lines of credit  and agricultural loans secured by real estate comprised and of the total loan portfolio at december  and moreover  the business activities of the company currently are focused in the california counties of plumas  nevada  placer  lassen  modoc  shasta  and sierra and beginning in the fourth quarter of in washoe county in northern nevada 
consequently  the results of operations and financial condition of the company are dependent upon the general trends in these economies and  in particular  the residential and commercial real estate markets 
in addition  the concentration of the company s operations in these areas of northeastern california and northern nevada exposes it to greater risk than other banking companies with a wider geographic base in the event of catastrophes  such as earthquakes  fires and floods in these regions 
the rates of interest charged on variable rate loans are set at specific increments in relation to the company s published lending rate and vary as the company s lending rate changes 
at december  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s loan portfolio was compromised of variable rate loans 
while real estate mortgage  commercial and consumer lending remain the foundation of the company s historical loan mix  some changes in the mix have occurred due to the changing economic environment and the resulting change in demand for certain loan types 
in addition  the company remains committed to the agricultural industry in northeastern california and will continue to pursue high quality agricultural loans 
agricultural loans include both commercial and commercial real estate loans 
the company s agricultural loan balances increased to million at december  up from million at december

the company attempts to minimize credit risk through its underwriting and credit review policies 
the company s credit review process includes internally prepared credit reviews as well as contracting with an outside firm to conduct periodic credit reviews 
the company s management and lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a quarterly basis  or more frequently as loan conditions change 
the board of directors  through the loan committee  reviews the asset quality of new and criticized loans on a monthly basis and reports the findings to the full board of directors 
in management s opinion  this loan review system facilitates the early identification of potential criticized loans 
net charge offs during the year ended december  totaled  or of total loans  compared to  or of total loans  for the comparable period in and  or of total loans for the comparable period of the allowance for loan losses stood at of total loans as of december   versus of total loans as of december  the allowance for loan losses is established through charges to earnings in the form of the provision for loan losses 
loan losses are charged to and recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in loans 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans  including current economic 
table of contents conditions  maturity of the portfolio  size of the portfolio  industry concentrations  borrower credit history  collateral  the existing allowance for loan losses  independent credit reviews  current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses and the overall quality of the portfolio as determined by management  regulatory agencies  and independent credit review consultants retained by the company 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
the collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree  but must relate to the borrower s financial condition  cash flow  quality of the borrower s management expertise  collateral and guarantees  and state of the local economy 
the federal financial regulatory agencies in december issued a new interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses along with supplemental frequently asked questions 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the company follows these guidelines 
the policy statement revises and replaces a policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses 
the agencies issued the revised policy statement in view of today s uncertain economic environment and the presence of concentrations in untested loan products in the loan portfolios of insured depository institutions 
the policy statement has also been revised to conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap and post supervisory guidance 
the policy statement reiterates that each institution has a responsibility for developing  maintaining and documenting a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature  scope  and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the allowance for loan and lease losses and the provision for loan and lease losses and states that each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the allowance for loan and lease losses in accordance with gaap  the institution s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
the policy statement also restates that insured depository institutions must maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio  and that estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the policy statement states that prudent  conservative  but not excessive  loan loss allowances that represent management s best estimate from within an acceptable range of estimated losses are appropriate 
in addition  the company incorporates the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 which represents the sec staff s view related to methodologies and supporting documentation for the allowance for loan and lease losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the commission s interpretations 
the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses consists of several key elements  which include but are not limited to specific allocation for problem graded loans classified loans  general or formula allocation  and discretionary allocation based on loan portfolio segmentation 
the company s methodology incorporates the following accounting pronouncements in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
specific allocations are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified  impaired  and other loans in which management believes that the collection of principal and interest under the original terms of the loan agreement are in question 
for purposes of this analysis  classified loans are grouped by internal risk classifications which are special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak  as the 
table of contents borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends  which if not corrected  could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade 
substandard loans have well defined weaknesses which  if not corrected  could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt 
a loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable 
classified loans  as defined by the company  include loans categorized as substandard and doubtful 
loans classified as loss are immediately charged off 
formula allocations are calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans with similar characteristics 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience as adjusted for changes in the business cycle and on the internal risk grade of those loans and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the formula allocation analysis incorporates loan losses over the past seven years 
loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the estimated loss exposure resulting from changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
the discretionary allocation is based upon management s evaluation of various loan segment conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the conditions may include  but are not limited to  general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  and other business conditions 
the following table provides certain information for the years indicated with respect to the company s allowance for loan losses as well as charge off and recovery activity 
at december  dollars in thousands balance at beginning of period charge offs commercial and agricultural real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer total charge offs recoveries commercial and agricultural real estate mortgage real estate construction consumer total recoveries net charge offs provision for loan losses balance at end of period net charge offs during the period to average loans allowance for loan losses to total loans the company places loans days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
a loan is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status the company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest 
interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable 
where the collectibility of the principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management  it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming days delinquent 

table of contents impaired loans are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section 
the primary difference between impaired loans and nonperforming loans is that impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due  restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include identified problem loans other than delinquent loans where it is considered probable that we will not collect all amounts due to us including both principal and interest in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the following table sets forth the amount of the company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated 
none of the company s loans were troubled debt restructurings

the specific allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans was  and  at december  and  respectively 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in most cases  the company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans 
for the years ended december   and  the company recognized   and  respectively  of income on such loans 
it is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains adequate to absorb the inherent risk of loss in the portfolio 
management believes that the allowance at december  is adequate 
however  the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty 
accordingly  the company cannot predict whether charge offs of loans in excess of the allowance may occur in future periods 
investment portfolio and federal funds sold 
total investment securities and federal funds sold decreased million  or  to million as of december   down from million at december  during the company utilized the proceeds from the maturities and calls of 
table of contents investment securities along with advances from the federal home loan bank to fund its loan growth 
this resulted in the company increasing its net interest margin as it replaced lower yielding investments with loans 
the company intends to continue to fund a portion of its anticipated loan growth in with funds generated from matured or called investment securities 
since the addition of million in deposits from branch acquisitions in late  the bank has continued to migrate the original placement of these amounts from short term investment securities into higher yielding loan balances

as these securities mature the proceeds where used to primarily to fund growth in the loan portfolio 
during the company purchased  of securities while maturities and principal repayments totaled million the company s investments in mortgage backed securities of us government agencies achieve both an increase in interest income and provide cash flows for liquidity and reinvestment opportunities 
at december   total balances in these mortgage backed securities amounted to million down from million at december  although these pass through securities typically have final maturities of between ten and fifteen years  the pass through nature of the monthly principal and interest payments is expected to significantly reduce the average life of these securities 
municipal securities provide attractive tax equivalent yields for the company 
since the majority of the interest earnings on these securities are not taxable for federal purposes the addition of municipal securities results in a reduction in the effective tax rate of the company 
the company classifies its investment securities as available for sale or held to maturity 
the company s intent is to hold all securities classified as held to maturity until maturity and management believes that it has the ability to do so 
securities classified as available for sale may be sold to implement the company s asset liability management strategies and in response to changes in interest rates  prepayment rates and similar factors

table of contents deposits 
total deposits were million as of december   a decrease of million  or  from the december  balance of million 
competition for deposit dollars throughout the company s service area  both from bank and non bank sources and a lack of significant deposit growth in the company s service area have contributed to this decline in deposits 
the company believes that additional deposits could be generated through aggressive pricing  but has chosen to rely on alternative sources of liquidity to fund additions to its loan portfolio during the company continues to manage the mix of its deposits consistent with its identity as a community bank serving the financial needs of its customers

this account is intended to pay rates comparable to those available on a typical brokerage account 
since its introduction  there has been significant growth in the total money fund plu balances with an increase of million in and balances at december  of million 
deposits represent the bank s primary source of funds 
deposits are primarily core deposits in that they are demand  savings and time deposits generated from local businesses and individuals 
these sources are considered to be relatively stable  long term relationships thereby enhancing steady growth of the deposit base without major fluctuations in overall deposit balances 
the company experiences  to a small degree  some seasonality with the slower growth period between november through april  and the higher growth period from may through october 
in order to assist in meeting any funding demands  the company maintains unsecured borrowing arrangements with several correspondent banks in addition to a secured borrowing arrangement with the federal home loan bank for longer more permanent funding needs

capital resources shareholders equity 
shareholders equity as of december  increased million  or  to million from million as of december  this increase was due to the retention of current period earnings of million and  to a lesser extent  the net funds received from key employees and directors exercising their stock options totaling  stock based compensation expense of  and a decrease in unrealized losses on available for sale investment securities of  partially offsetting these increases were two cash dividends totaling million paid during capital standards 
an increase in the company s capital ratios during was attributed to increase in shareholders equity described above while the level of risk weighted assets remained fairly consistent 
the company uses a variety of measures to evaluate its capital adequacy  with risk based capital ratios calculated separately for the company and the bank 
management reviews these capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that they are within established internal and external guidelines 
the company s current capital position exceeds minimum thresholds established by industry regulators  and by current regulatory definitions the bank is well capitalized  the highest rating of the categories defined under federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act fdicia of the fdic has promulgated risk based capital guidelines for all state non member banks such as the bank 
these guidelines establish a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures 
there are two categories of capital under the guidelines tier capital includes common stockholders equity  and qualifying trust preferred securities including notes payable to unconsolidated special purpose entities that issue trust preferred securities  less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on available for sale investment securities carried at fair market value  tier capital can include qualifying subordinated debt and the allowance for loan and lease losses  subject to certain limitations 
as noted previously  the company s junior subordinated debentures represent borrowings from its unconsolidated subsidiaries that have issued an aggregate million in trust preferred securities 
these trust preferred securities currently qualify for inclusion as tier capital for regulatory purposes as they do not exceed of total tier capital  but are classified as long term debt in accordance with gaap 
on march   the federal reserve board adopted a final rule that allows the continued inclusion of trust preferred securities and or related subordinated debentures in the tier i capital of bank holding companies 
however  under the final rule  after a five year transition period goodwill must be deducted from tier i capital prior to calculating the limitation 
generally  the amount of junior subordinated debentures in excess of the tier limitation is included in tier capital

off balance sheet arrangements loan commitments 
in the normal course of business  there are various commitments outstanding to extend credits that are not reflected in the financial statements 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
annual review of commercial credit lines  letters of credit and ongoing monitoring of outstanding balances reduces the risk of loss associated with these commitments 
as of december   the company had million in unfunded loan commitments and thousand in letters of credit 
of the million in unfunded loan commitments  million and million represented commitments to commercial and consumer customers  respectively 
of the total unfunded commitments at december   million were secured by real estate  of which million was secured by commercial real estate and million was secured by residential real estate in the form of equity lines of credit 
the commercial loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent business lines of credit  while the consumer loan commitments not secured by real estate primarily represent revolving credit card lines 
since  some of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessary represent future cash requirements

management believes that the company s available sources of funds  including short term borrowings  will provide adequate liquidity for its operations in the foreseeable future 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices such as interest rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
as a financial institution  the company s market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk exposure 
fluctuation in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the company s assets and liabilities  and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
based upon the nature of its operations  the company is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
however  the bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within northeastern california  is subject to risks associated with the local economies 
the fundamental objective of the company s management of its assets and liabilities is to maximize the economic value of the company while maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable 
management believes an acceptable degree of exposure to interest rate risk results from the management of assets and liabilities through using floating rate loans and deposits  maturities  pricing and mix to attempt to neutralize the potential impact of changes in market interest rates 
the company s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits  trust preferred securities and other borrowings 
the company  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
the company manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
the company seeks to control its interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
the company has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
as part of this effort  the company measures interest rate risk utilizing both an internal asset liability management system as well as employing independent third party reviews to confirm the reasonableness of the assumptions used to measure and report the company s interest rate risk  enabling management to make any adjustments necessary 
interest rate risk is managed by the company s asset liability committee alco  which includes members of senior management 
the alco monitors interest rate risk by analyzing the potential impact on net interest income from potential changes in interest rates and considers the impact of alternative strategies or changes in balance sheet structure 
the alco manages the company s balance sheet in part to maintain the potential impact on net interest income within acceptable ranges despite changes in interest rates 
the company s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on at least a quarterly basis by alco 
net interest income simulation 
in order to measure interest rate risk at december   the company used a simulation model to project changes in net interest income that result from forecasted changes in interest rates 
this analysis which is performed quarterly by management  calculates the difference between net interest income forecasted using a rising and falling interest rate scenario and net interest income forecast using a base market interest rate derived from the current treasury yield curve 
the income simulation model includes various assumptions regarding the repricing relationships for each of the company s products 
many of the company s assets are floating rate loans  which are assumed to reprice immediately and to the same extent as the change in market rates according to their contracted index 
some loans and investment vehicles include the opportunity of prepayment imbedded options and accordingly the simulation model uses national indexes to estimate these prepayments and reinvest their proceeds at current yields 
the company s non term deposit products reprice more slowly  usually changing less than the change in market rates and at the discretion of the company 
this analysis indicates the impact of changes in net interest income for the given set of rate changes and assumptions 
it assumes the balance sheet grows modestly but that its structure will remain similar to the structure at year end 
it does not account for all factors that impact this analysis  including changes by management to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes or secondary impacts such as changes to the company s credit risk profile as interest rates change 
furthermore  loan prepayment rate estimates and spread relationships change 
table of contents regularly 
interest rate changes create changes in actual loan prepayment rates that will differ from the market estimates incorporated in this analysis 
changes that vary significantly from the assumptions may have significant effects on the company s net interest income
