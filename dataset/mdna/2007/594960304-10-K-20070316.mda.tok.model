item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we began operations in may to develop and commercialize technology for displaying images and information 
in  we acquired an exclusive license to certain virtual retinal display technology from the university of washington and entered into a research agreement with the university of washington to further develop the virtual retinal display technology 
we have continued to develop the virtual retinal display technology as part of our broader research and development efforts relating to the light scanning technology 
we are developing a small module that could be embedded into a mobile device such as a cell phone or pda to project a moving or still image onto a variety of surfaces 
the module could be modified to be embedded into the dash of a car to create a head up display for navigation system information or other information useful to the driver 
we also produce and sell flic  a hand held bar code scanner 
we expect to continue funding prototype and demonstration versions of products incorporating the light scanning technology at least through future revenues  profits and cash flow and our ability to achieve our strategic objectives as described herein will depend on a number of factors  including acceptance of the light scanning technology by various industries and original equipment manufacturers  market acceptance of products incorporating the light scanning technology and the technical performance of such products 
we have incurred substantial losses since inception and expect to incur a substantial loss during the fiscal year ended december  key accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimate  including those related to revenue recognition  contract losses  bad debts  investments and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the display and image capture industries  information provided by our current and prospective customers and strategic partners  information available from other outside sources  and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following key accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize contract revenue as work progresses on long term  cost plus fixed fee and fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we use this revenue recognition methodology because we can make reliable estimates of the revenue and costs 
recognized revenues are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion and actual revenue and cost become certain 
revisions in revenue estimates are reflected in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
revisions in these estimates could significantly impact recognized revenue in any one reporting period 
if the us government cancels a contract  we would receive payment for work performed and costs committed to prior to the cancellation 
our product sales generally include acceptance provisions 
we recognize revenue for product shipments upon acceptance of the product by the customer or expiration of the contractual acceptance period 
losses on uncompleted contracts 
we establish an allowance for estimated losses if a contract has an estimated cost to complete that is in excess of the remaining contract value 
the entire estimated loss is recorded in the period in which the loss is first determined 
we determine the estimated cost to complete a contract through a detailed review of the work to be completed  the resources available to complete the work and the technical difficulty of the remaining work 
if the revised estimated cost to complete the contract is higher than the total contract revenue  the entire contract loss is recognized 
the actual cost to complete a contract can vary significantly from the estimated cost  due to a variety of factors including availability of technical staff  availability of materials and technical difficulties that arise during a project 
most of our development contracts are cost plus fixed fee type contracts 
under these types of contracts  we are not required to spend more than the contract value to complete the contracted work 
allowance for uncollectible receivables 
we maintain allowances for uncollectible receivables  including accounts receivable  cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts and receivables from related parties 
we review several factors in determining the allowances including the customer s and related party s past payment history and financial condition 
if the financial condition of our customers or the related parties with whom we have receivables were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
inventory 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost basis 
we review several factors in determining the market value of our inventory including evaluating the replacement cost of the raw materials and the net realizable value of the finished goods 
if we do not achieve our targeted sales prices  if market conditions for our components or products were to decline or if we do not achieve our sales forecast  additional reductions in the carrying value of the inventory would be required 
warrants and derivatives 
in  we issued convertible notes that include rights to convert the notes into our common stock 
we also issued warrants to purchase common stock in connection with the notes 
the conversion right and the warrants are considered to be derivatives under the guidance provided by fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of these instruments 
we use this model because it is widely accepted and provides comparability across a wide range of similar companies 
to use the black scholes option pricing model we must evaluate a range of estimates and determine the reasonable estimate of future stock volatility and interest rates 
changes in these estimates could result in a materially different valuation of the instruments 
other models for valuing these instruments exist and the use of an alternative model could result in a materially different valuation of the instruments 
employee share based compensation 
we issue share based compensation to employees in the form of options exercisable into our common stock 
we account for employee share based compensation under the guidance provided by financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  share based payment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the value of these instruments 
we use this model because it results in reasonable estimated fair values for our standard options  is widely accepted and provides comparability across a wide range of similar companies 
to use the black scholes options pricing model we must evaluate a range of variables and determine estimates of future option lives  stock volatility and interest rates 
in addition  once estimated fair values are developed  we must estimate prevesting forfeiture rates 
changes in these estimates could result in a materially different valuation of the stock based compensation 
other models for valuing stock based compensation exist and the use of an alternative model could result in a materially different valuation of the compensation expense 
the key accounting policies described above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for us to apply judgment or make estimates 
there are also areas in which our judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result to our consolidated financial statements 
additional information about our accounting policies  and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles  are set forth in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
inflation has not had a material impact on our revenues  or income from continuing operations over the three most recent fiscal years 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change government revenue   commercial revenue   total contract revenue   we earn contract revenue from performance on development contracts with the united states government and commercial customers 
our contract revenue in a particular period is dependent upon when we enter into a contract  the value of the contracts we have entered into  and the availability of technical resources to perform work on the contracts 
contract revenue was lower during than in  due to lower beginning commercial contract backlog  the later timing of completing government contract negotiations  and the allocation of resources to internally funded development projects 
during  we earned million from work performed on a contract with ethicon endo surgery  inc  a subsidiary of johnson johnson  integrating our technology into certain medical devices compared to  during we delivered the prototype devices as required and completed the work under the contract in ethicon has seventeen months to conduct market evaluations before it decides to continue development 
we do not anticipate earning additional material revenue from ethicon until at least in september  we entered into an month million contract with general dynamics c systems to supply full color  daylight readable  see through helmet mounted displays as part of the us army s mounted warrior hmd improvement program 
general dynamics holds prime contracts with the us army for other warrior programs including land warrior  air warrior and future force warrior advanced technology demonstration 
the contract specifies the development and delivery of ten full color display units for evaluation 
in september  we also entered into a month agreement with visteon  a global tier automotive supplier 
under the agreement  we will work with visteon to design and produce a series of advanced automotive head up display samples 
visteon  working in collaboration with us  is expected to use the samples to demonstrate the performance of our laser based light scanning technology and to refine commercial product requirements of automotive head up displays 
as long as most of our revenue is earned from performance on development contracts  we believe there may be a high degree of variability in revenue from one period to another

in june  we decided not to continue to promote the nomad product 
our quarterly revenue may vary substantially due to the timing of product orders from customers  production constraints and raw material availability 
the backlog of product orders at december  was approximately  compared to  at december   all of which is scheduled for delivery during cost of contract revenue 
of of contract contract revenue revenue change change cost of contract revenue   cost of contract revenue includes both the direct and allocated indirect costs of performing on development contracts 
direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in performing on a contract 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our research and development department and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
cost of contract revenue is determined both by the level of direct costs incurred on development contracts and by the level of indirect costs incurred in operating and building our technical capabilities and capacity 
the cost of contract revenue can fluctuate substantially from period to period depending on the level of both the direct costs incurred in the performance of projects and the level of indirect costs incurred 
our research and development department works on both contract revenue projects and internally funded development projects 
we allocate the research and development department overhead to cost of contract revenue and research and development expense based on the proportion of direct labor cost incurred in cost of contract revenue and research and development  respectively 
as a result of the lower direct labor cost in cost of contract revenue in  approximately  less overhead was allocated to cost of contract revenue than in we expect that cost of contract revenue on an absolute dollar basis may increase in the future 
this increase will likely result from additional development contract work that we expect to perform 
the cost of revenue as a percentage of revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the contract cost mix and the levels of direct and indirect costs incurred 
however  over longer periods of time we expect modest fluctuations in the cost of contract revenue  as a percentage of contract revenue 
cost of product revenue

direct costs include labor  materials and other costs incurred directly in the manufacture of flic and nomad 
indirect costs include labor and other costs associated with operating our manufacturing capabilities and capacity 
our overhead  which includes the costs of procuring  inspecting and storing material  facility and depreciation costs  is allocated to inventory  cost of product revenue  cost of contract revenue  and research and development expense based on the proportion of direct material purchased for the respective activity 
during  we expensed approximately  or  less than in  of manufacturing overhead associated with production capacity in excess of production requirements 
cost of product revenue for includes the write off of a total of  of inventory  compared to  for the write offs were due to changes in product design  our decision not to promote the nomad product  and customer demand that caused components and accessories to become obsolete or slow moving 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market and reduce the value of our inventory to its estimated scrap value when we determine that we will probably not sell the inventory during the next months 
as a result of our decision not to promote the nomad product we also recorded  in depreciation expense to fully depreciate the fixed assets used in nomad production 
we have periodically entered into noncancelable purchase contracts in order to ensure the availability of materials to support flic production 
we periodically assess the need to provide for impairment on these purchase contracts and record a loss on purchase commitments when required 
in december  we recorded a loss of  to cost of product revenue as a result of commitments to purchase materials for the flic scanner that are in excess of our estimated future proceeds from the sale of the flic scanners 
we expect that the cost of product revenue on an absolute dollar basis will increase in the future as expected sales of commercial products increase 
the cost of product revenue as a percentage of product revenue can fluctuate significantly from period to period  depending on the product mix  the level of overhead expense and the volume of direct materials purchased 
research and development expense

our research and development department works on both contract revenue projects and internally funded development projects 
we allocate the research and development department overhead to cost of contract revenue and research and development expense based on the proportion of direct labor cost incurred in cost of contract revenue and research and development  respectively as part of our turnaround strategy announced in february  we established a target of reducing total overhead cost by approximately  excluding the impact of adopting fas r and severance costs 
during the year we directed more engineering labor to work on internally funded development projects than planned resulting in higher research and development expense 
the following table eliminates the impacts of adopting fas r and severance costs on research and development expense 
research and development expense  as reported   fas r options expense severance research and development expense  as adjusted   total costs incurred by our research and development department for cost of contract revenue and research and development expense activities were higher during than research and development expense was higher in than due to higher direct labor  subcontractor and material costs 
the higher proportions of direct labor on internally funded projects relative to revenue projects in than in resulted in more indirect overhead cost absorption into research and development expense in we believe that a substantial level of continuing research and development expense will be required to develop additional commercial products using the light scanning technology 
accordingly  we anticipate our level of research and development spending will continue to be substantial

prior to lumera s initial public offering in july  we were organized into two segments microvision  which is engaged in light scanning and related technologies  and lumera  which is engaged in optical systems components technology 
the segments were determined based on how management viewed and evaluated our operations 
a portion of each segments administration expenses arose from shared services and infrastructure that microvision had provided to both segments in order to realize economies of scale and to efficiently use resources 
these efficiencies include costs of certain legal  accounting  human resources and other microvision corporate and infrastructure costs 
these expenses were allocated to the segments and the allocation was determined on a basis that we considered to be a reasonable reflection of the utilization of services provided to  or benefits received by  the segments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk substantially all of our cash equivalents and investment securities have variable interest rates and  as such  the fair values of the principal of these instruments are not affected by changes in market interest rates

during the calendar day period ended march   lumera common stock has traded between and 
we own approximately of lumera s common stock 
since we hold a large percentage of lumera s common stock  if an active market does not develop or is not sustained  it may be difficult to sell the shares of lumera s common stock at an attractive price or at all 
the likelihood of lumera s success  and the value of our common stock  must be considered in light of the risks frequently encountered by early stage companies  especially those formed to develop and market new technologies 
these risks include lumera s potential inability to establish product sales and marketing capabilities  to establish and maintain markets for their potential products  and to continue to develop and upgrade their technologies to keep pace with changes in technology and the growth of markets using polymer materials 
if lumera is unsuccessful in meeting these challenges  its stock price  and the value of our investment  could decrease
