item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting and stock based compensation for additional information about charges to earnings associated with our recent acquisitions 
we expect to continue to incur additional costs associated with combining the operations of our previously acquired companies  which may be substantial 
additional costs may include costs of employee redeployment  relocation and retention  including salary increases or bonuses  accelerated amortization of deferred equity compensation and severance payments  reorganization or closure of facilities  taxes and termination of contracts that provide redundant or conflicting services 
some of these costs may have to be accounted for as expenses that would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made 
our international sales and operations subject us to additional risks that can adversely affect our operating results 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues  and have significant operations  outside of the united states 
our international operations include software development  sales  customer support and shared administrative service centers 
we are subject to a variety of risks  including those related to general economic conditions in each country or region  regulatory changes  political unrest  terrorism and the potential for other hostilities and public health risks  particularly in areas in which we have significant operations 
we face challenges in managing an organization operating in various countries  which can entail longer payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  overlapping tax regimes  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  difficulties in transferring funds from certain countries and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
we must comply with a variety of international laws and regulations  including trade restrictions  local labor ordinances  changes in tariff rates and import and export licensing requirements 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties 
we are a majority shareholder of i flex solutions limited  a publicly traded indian software company focused on the banking industry 
as the majority shareholder of an international entity  we are faced with several additional risks  including being subject to local securities regulations and being unable to exert full control or obtain financial and other information on a timely basis 
we may experience foreign currency gains and losses 
we conduct a portion of our business in currencies other than the united states dollar 
our revenues and operating results are adversely affected when the dollar strengthens relative to other currencies and are positively affected when the dollar weakens 
changes in the value of major foreign currencies  particularly the euro  japanese yen and british pound relative to the united states dollar can significantly affect revenues and our operating results 
our foreign currency transaction gains and losses  primarily related to sublicense fees and other agreements among us and our subsidiaries and distributors  are charged against earnings in the period incurred 
we enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain transaction and translation exposures in major currencies  but we will continue to experience foreign currency gains and losses in certain instances where it is not possible or cost effective to hedge foreign currencies 
oracle on demand and crm on demand may not be successful 
we offer oracle on demand outsourcing services for our applications and database technology  delivered either at our data center facilities or at a site of our customer s choosing 
we also offer crm on demand  which is a service offering that provides our customers with our siebel crm software functionality delivered via a hosted solution that we manage 
these business models continue to evolve and we may not be able to compete effectively  generate significant revenues or develop them into profitable businesses 
we incur expenses associated with the infrastructures and marketing of our oracle on demand and crm on demand businesses in advance of our ability to recognize the revenues associated with our subscription based contracts 
these businesses are subject to a variety of risks including demand for these services may not meet our expectations  we may not be able to operate these businesses at an acceptable profit level  
table of contents we manage critical customer applications  data and other confidential information through oracle on demand and crm on demand  accordingly  we face increased exposure to significant damage claims and risk to future business prospects in the event of system failures or inadequate disaster recovery or misappropriation of customer confidential information  we may face regulatory exposure in certain areas such as data privacy  data security and export compliance  as well as workforce reduction claims as a result of customers transferring their information technology functions to us  the laws and regulations applicable to hosted service providers are unsettled  particularly in the areas of privacy and security and use of offshore resources  changes in these laws could affect our ability to provide services from or to some locations and could increase both the costs and risks associated with providing the services  demand for these services may be affected by customer and media concerns about security risks and or use of outsourced services providers more generally  and our offerings may require large fixed costs such as for data centers  computers  network infrastructure and security and we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to offset these costs and generate acceptable operating margins from these offerings 
we may be unable to hire enough qualified employees or we may lose key employees 
we rely on the continued service of our senior management  including our chief executive officer  members of our executive team and other key employees and the hiring of new qualified employees 
in the software industry  there is substantial and continuous competition for highly skilled business  product development  technical and other personnel 
in addition  acquisitions could cause us to lose key personnel of the acquired companies or at oracle 
we may experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices 
we may not be successful in recruiting new personnel and in retaining and motivating existing personnel 
with rare exceptions  we do not have long term employment or non competition agreements with our employees 
members of our senior management team have left oracle over the years for a variety of reasons  and we cannot assure you that there will not be additional departures  which may be disruptive to our operations 
we continually focus on improving our cost structure by hiring personnel in countries where advanced technical expertise is available at lower costs 
when we make adjustments to our workforce  we may incur expenses associated with workforce reductions that delay the benefit of a more efficient workforce structure 
we may also experience increased competition for employees in these countries as the trend toward globalization continues which may affect our employee retention efforts and or increase our expenses in an effort to offer a competitive compensation program 
part of our total compensation program includes stock options 
stock options are an important tool in attracting and retaining employees in our industry 
if our stock price performs poorly it may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract employees 
in addition  because we now expense all stock based compensation  we may in the future change our stock based and other compensation practices 
some of the changes we are considering include the reduction in the number of employees granted options  a reduction in the number of options granted and a change to alternative forms of stock based compensation 
any changes in our compensation practices or changes made by competitors could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel 
we might experience significant errors or security flaws in our products and services 
despite testing prior to their release  software products frequently contain errors or security flaws  especially when first introduced or when new versions are released 
the detection and correction of any security flaws can be time consuming and costly 
errors in our software products could affect the ability of our products to work with other hardware or software products  could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
if we experience errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products  we could lose revenues 
in addition  we run our own business operations  oracle on demand  and other outsourcing  support and consulting services  on our products and networks and any security flaws  if exploited  could affect our ability to conduct business operations 
end users  who rely on our products and services for applications that are critical to their businesses  may have a greater sensitivity to product errors and security 
table of contents vulnerabilities than customers for software products generally 
software product errors and security flaws in our products or services could expose us to product liability  performance and or warranty claims as well as harm our reputation  which could impact our future sales of products and services 
in addition  we may be legally required to publicly report security breaches of our services  which could adversely impact future business prospects for those services 
we may not receive significant revenues from our current research and development efforts for several years  if at all 
developing and localizing software is expensive and the investment in product development often involves a long payback cycle 
we have made and expect to continue to make significant investments in software research and development and related product opportunities 
accelerated product introductions and short product life cycles require high levels of expenditures for research and development that could adversely affect our operating results if not offset by revenue increases 
we believe that we must continue to dedicate a significant amount of resources to our research and development efforts to maintain our competitive position 
however  we do not expect to receive significant revenues from these investments for several years if at all 
our sales to government clients subject us to risks including early termination  audits  investigations  sanctions and penalties 
we derive revenues from contracts with the united states government  state and local governments and their respective agencies  which may terminate most of these contracts at any time  without cause 
there is increased pressure for governments and their agencies  both domestically and internationally  to reduce spending 
our federal government contracts are subject to the approval of appropriations being made by the united states congress to fund the expenditures under these contracts 
similarly  our contracts at the state and local levels are subject to government funding authorizations 
additionally  government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations which could result in various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions  including termination of contracts  refund of a portion of fees received  forfeiture of profits  suspension of payments  fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business 
business disruptions could affect our operating results 
a significant portion of our research and development activities and certain other critical business operations is concentrated in a few geographic areas 
we are a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems could cause delays in completing sales and providing services  including some of our on demand offerings 
a major earthquake  fire or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and as a result our future operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
adverse litigation results could affect our business 
we are subject to various legal proceedings 
litigation can be lengthy  expensive  and disruptive to our operations and results cannot be predicted with certainty 
an adverse decision could result in monetary damages or injunctive relief that could affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
additional information regarding certain of the lawsuits we are involved in is discussed under note in our notes to consolidated financial statements 
peoplesoft s customer assurance program may expose us to substantial liabilities if triggered 
in june  in response to our tender offer  peoplesoft implemented what it referred to as the customer assurance program or cap 
the cap incorporated a provision in peoplesoft s standard licensing arrangement that purports to contractually burden oracle  as a result of its acquisition of peoplesoft  with a contingent obligation to make payments to peoplesoft customers should oracle fail to take certain business actions for a fixed period of time subsequent to the acquisition 
the payment obligation  which typically expires four years from the date of the contract  is fixed at an amount generally between two and five times the license and first year support fees paid to peoplesoft in the applicable license transaction 
this purported obligation was not reflected as a liability on peoplesoft s balance sheet as peoplesoft concluded that it could be triggered only following the consummation of an acquisition 
peoplesoft used six different standard versions of the cap over the month period commencing june peoplesoft ceased using the cap on december   the date on which we acquired a controlling interest in peoplesoft 
we have concluded that  as of the date of the peoplesoft acquisition  the penalty provisions under the cap represented a contingent liability of oracle 
the aggregate potential cap obligation as of may  
table of contents was billion 
unless the cap provisions are removed from these licensing arrangements  we do not expect the aggregate potential cap obligation to decline substantially until fiscal year when a significant number of these provisions begin to expire 
the last cap obligation will expire on december  we have not recorded a liability related to the cap  as we do not believe it is probable that our post acquisition activities related to the peoplesoft product line will trigger an obligation to make any payment pursuant to the cap 
in addition  while no assurance can be given as to the ultimate outcome of litigation  we believe we would also have substantial defenses with respect to the legality and enforceability of the cap contract provisions in response to any claims seeking payment from oracle under the cap terms 
while we have taken extensive steps to assure customers that we intend to continue developing and supporting the peoplesoft and jd edwards product lines and as of may  we have not received any claims for cap payments  peoplesoft customers may assert claims for cap payments 
we may have exposure to additional tax liabilities 
as a multinational corporation  we are subject to income taxes as well as non income based taxes  in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many intercompany transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
our intercompany transfer pricing is currently being reviewed by the irs and by foreign tax jurisdictions and will likely be subject to additional audits in the future 
we previously negotiated three unilateral advance pricing agreements with the irs that cover many of our intercompany transfer pricing issues and preclude the irs from making a transfer pricing adjustment within the scope of these agreements 
however  these agreements  which are effective for fiscal years through may   do not cover all elements of our transfer pricing and do not bind tax authorities outside the united states 
we have finalized one bilateral advance pricing agreement and currently are negotiating an additional bilateral agreement to cover the period from june  through may  there can be no guarantee that such negotiations will result in an agreement 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
we are also subject to non income taxes  such as payroll  sales  use  value added  net worth  property and goods and services taxes  in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities with respect to these non income taxes and may have exposure to additional non income tax liabilities 
our acquisition activities have increased our non income tax exposures 
there are risks associated with our outstanding indebtedness 
as of may   we had an aggregate of billion of outstanding indebtedness that will mature between and and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future 
our ability to pay interest and repay the principal for our indebtedness is dependent upon our ability to manage our business operations and the other factors discussed in this section 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to manage any of these risks successfully 
in addition  changes by any rating agency to our outlook or credit rating could negatively affect the value and liquidity of both our debt and equity securities 
our stock price could become more volatile and your investment could lose value 
all of the factors discussed in this section could affect our stock price 
the timing of announcements in the public market regarding new products  product enhancements or technological advances by our competitors or us  and any announcements by us of acquisitions  major transactions  or management changes could also affect our stock price 
our stock price is subject to speculation in the press and the analyst community  changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by financial analysts  changes in investors or analysts valuation measures for our stock  our credit ratings and market trends unrelated to our performance 
a significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class actions lawsuits  which could result in substantial costs and divert management s attention and resources  which could adversely affect our business

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are the world s largest enterprise software company 
we are organized into two businesses  software and services  which are further divided into five operating segments 
each of these operating segments has unique characteristics and faces different opportunities and challenges 
although we report our actual results in united states dollars  we conduct a significant number of transactions in currencies other than united states dollars 
therefore  we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying business performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
an overview of our five operating segments follows 
software business our software business is comprised of two operating segments new software license revenues and software license updates and product support revenues 
we expect that our software business revenues will continue to increase  which should allow us to improve margins and profits and continue to make investments in research and development 
new software licenses we license our database and middleware as well as our applications software to businesses of many sizes  government agencies  educational institutions and resellers 
the growth in new software license revenues is affected by the strength of general economic and business conditions  governmental budgetary constraints  the competitive position of our software products and acquisitions 
the new software license business is also characterized by long sales cycles 
the timing of a few large software license transactions can substantially affect our quarterly new software license revenues 
since our new software license revenues in a particular quarter can be difficult to predict as a result of the timing of a few large software license transactions  we believe that analysis of new software revenues on a trailing quarter period provides more visibility into the underlying fundamental performance of our software revenues than analysis of quarterly revenues 
new software license revenues represented of our total revenues in fiscal our new software license margins have been affected by the amortization of intangible assets associated with companies we have acquired 
competition in the software business is intense 
our goal is to maintain a first or second position in each of our software product categories and certain industry segments as well as to grow our software revenues faster than our competitors 
we believe that the features and functionality of our software products are as strong as they have ever been 
we have focused on lowering the total cost of ownership of our software products by improving integration  decreasing installation times  lowering administration costs and improving the ease of use 
reducing the total cost of ownership of our products provides our customers with a higher return on their investment  which we believe will create more demand for our products and services and provide us with a competitive advantage 
we have also continued to focus on improving the overall quality of our software products and service levels 
we believe this will lead to higher customer satisfaction and loyalty and help us achieve our goal of becoming our customers leading technology advisor 
software license updates and product support customers that purchase software license updates and product support are granted rights to unspecified product upgrades and maintenance releases issued during the support period  as well as technical support assistance 
in fiscal  we also introduced oracle unbreakable linux support  which provides enterprise level support for the linux operating system 
substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually 
the growth of software license updates and product support revenues is influenced by three factors the support contract base of companies acquired  the renewal rate of the support contract base and the amount of new support contracts sold in connection with the sale of new software licenses 
software license updates and product support revenues  which represent approximately of our total revenues in fiscal  are our highest margin business unit 
support margins during fiscal were  and accounted for of our total margins over the same respective period 
we believe that software license updates and product support revenues and margins will continue to grow for the following reasons acquisitions over the past three years have significantly increased our support contract base  as well as the portfolio of products available to be licensed 

table of contents substantially all customers purchase license updates and product support when they buy new software licenses  resulting in a further increase in our support contract base 
even if new license revenue growth was flat  software license updates and product support revenues would continue to grow assuming renewal and cancellation rates remained relatively constant since substantially all new software license transactions add to the support contract base 
substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their support contracts when eligible for renewal 
we record adjustments to reduce support obligations assumed in business acquisitions to their estimated fair value at the acquisition dates 
as a result  as required by business combination accounting rules  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts that would have been otherwise recorded by acquired businesses as independent entities in the amount of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
to the extent underlying support contracts are renewed with us following an acquisition  we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the majority of which are one year 
services business our services business consists of consulting  on demand and education revenues 
our services business  which represents of our total revenues in fiscal  has significantly lower margins than our software business 
consulting consulting revenues have increased primarily due to consulting services provided by i flex as well as an increase in application implementations created by higher sales of new software applications over the past year 
we expect consulting revenues to continue to grow as consulting revenues tend to lag software revenues by several quarters since consulting services  if purchased  are typically performed after the purchase of new software licenses and our new license growth rates have generally increased over the corresponding period in the prior year over the past several quarters 
on demand on demand includes oracle on demand  crm on demand and advanced customer services 
we believe that our on demand offerings provide an additional opportunity for customers to lower their total cost of ownership and can therefore provide us with a competitive advantage 
we have made and plan to continue to make investments in oracle on demand and crm on demand to support current and future revenue growth  which has negatively impacted on demand margins and we expect may continue to do so in the future 
education the purpose of our education services is to further enhance the usability of our software products by our customers and to create opportunities to grow our software revenues 
education revenues have been impacted by personnel reductions in our customers information technology departments  tighter controls over discretionary spending and greater use of outsourcing solutions 
despite these trends  we expect education revenues to increase in fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in customer training on the use of our acquired application products and increases in license revenues from our database and middleware products 
acquisitions an active acquisition program is an important element of our corporate strategy 
in the last three fiscal years  we have invested over billion  in the aggregate  to acquire companies  products  services and technologies  including the acquisitions of peoplesoft  inc  a provider of enterprise applications software products  siebel systems  inc  a provider of customer relationship management software  hyperion solutions corporation  a provider of enterprise performance management and business intelligence software  and others 
typically  the significant majority of our integration activities related to an acquisition are substantially complete in the united states within three to six months after the closing of the acquisition 
we believe our acquisition program supports our long term strategic direction  strengthens our competitive position  particularly in the applications marketplace  expands our customer base and provides greater scale to increase our investment in research and development to accelerate innovation  grow our earnings and increase stockholder value 
we expect to continue to acquire companies  products  services and technologies 
see note of 
table of contents our notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information related to our recent and pending acquisitions 
we believe we can fund additional acquisitions with our internally available cash and marketable securities  cash generated from operations  amounts available under our commercial paper program  additional borrowings or from the issuance of additional securities 
we estimate the financial impact of any potential acquisition with regard to earnings  operating margin  cash flow and return on invested capital targets before deciding to move forward with an acquisition 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
these accounting principles require us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions 
we believe that the estimates  judgments and assumptions upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time that these estimates  judgments and assumptions are made 
these estimates  judgments and assumptions can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
to the extent there are material differences between these estimates  judgments or assumptions and actual results  our financial statements will be affected 
the accounting policies that reflect our more significant estimates  judgments and assumptions and which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition business combinations goodwill accounting for income taxes legal and other contingencies stock based compensation allowances for doubtful accounts and returns in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting among available alternatives would not produce a materially different result 
our senior management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the finance and audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from the following sources software  which includes new software license and software license updates and product support revenues  and services  which include consulting  on demand and education revenues 
new software license revenues represent fees earned from granting customers licenses to use our database  middleware and applications software  and exclude revenues derived from software license updates  which are included in software license updates and product support 
while the basis for software license revenue recognition is substantially governed by the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants  we exercise judgment and use estimates in connection with the determination of the amount of software and services revenues to be recognized in each accounting period 
for software license arrangements that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software  we recognize new software license revenue when we enter into a legally binding arrangement with a customer for the license of software  we deliver the products  customer payment is deemed fixed or 
table of contents determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable 
substantially all of our new software license revenues are recognized in this manner 
the vast majority of our software license arrangements include software license updates and product support  which are recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement  typically one year 
software license updates provide customers with rights to unspecified software product upgrades  maintenance releases and patches released during the term of the support period 
product support includes internet access to technical content  as well as internet and telephone access to technical support personnel located in our global support centers 
software license updates and product support are generally priced as a percentage of the net new software license fees 
substantially all of our customers purchase both software license updates and product support when they acquire new software licenses 
in addition  substantially all of our customers renew their software license updates and product support contracts annually 
many of our software arrangements include consulting implementation services sold separately under consulting engagement contracts 
consulting revenues from these arrangements are generally accounted for separately from new software license revenues because the arrangements qualify as service transactions as defined in sop the more significant factors considered in determining whether the revenue should be accounted for separately include the nature of services ie  consideration of whether the services are essential to the functionality of the licensed product  degree of risk  availability of services from other vendors  timing of payments and impact of milestones or acceptance criteria on the realizability of the software license fee 
revenues for consulting services are generally recognized as the services are performed 
if there is a significant uncertainty about the project completion or receipt of payment for the consulting services  revenue is deferred until the uncertainty is sufficiently resolved 
we estimate the proportional performance on contracts with fixed or not to exceed fees on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
we recognize no more than of the milestone or total contract amount until project acceptance is obtained 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress towards completion  revenue is recognized when we receive final acceptance from the customer 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately using cost estimates that are based upon an average fully burdened daily rate applicable to the consulting organization delivering the services 
the complexity of the estimation process and factors relating to the assumptions  risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of the proportional performance method of accounting affects the amounts of revenue and related expenses reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including labor rates  utilization and efficiency variances and specification and testing requirement changes 
if an arrangement does not qualify for separate accounting of the software license and consulting transactions  then new software license revenue is generally recognized together with the consulting services based on contract accounting using either the percentage of completion or completed contract method 
contract accounting is applied to any arrangements that include milestones or customer specific acceptance criteria that may affect collection of the software license fees  where services include significant modification or customization of the software  where significant consulting services are provided for in the software license contract without additional charge or are substantially discounted  or where the software license payment is tied to the performance of consulting services 
on demand is comprised of oracle on demand  crm on demand and advanced customer services 
oracle on demand provides multi featured software and hardware management and maintenance services for our database  middleware and applications software at oracle s data center facilities or at a site of our customer s choosing 
crm on demand is a service offering that provides our customers with our siebel crm software functionality delivered via a hosted solution that we manage 
advanced customer services are earned by providing customers configuration and performance analysis  personalized support and annual on site technical services 
revenue from on demand services is recognized over the term of the service period  which is generally one year 
education revenues include instructor led  media based and internet based training in the use of our products 
education revenues are recognized as the classes or other education offerings are delivered 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we allocate revenue to each element of a transaction based upon its fair value as determined by vendor specific objective evidence 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for all 
table of contents elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately and for software license updates and product support services  is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
we may modify our pricing practices in the future  which could result in changes in our vendor specific objective evidence of fair value for these undelivered elements 
as a result  our future revenue recognition for multiple element arrangements could differ significantly from our historical results 
we defer revenue for any undelivered elements  and recognize revenue when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for such element 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
substantially all of our software license arrangements do not include acceptance provisions 
however  if acceptance provisions exist as part of public policy  for example in agreements with government entities when acceptance periods are required by law  or within previously executed terms and conditions that are referenced in the current agreement and are short term in nature  we provide for a sales return allowance in accordance with fasb statement no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
if acceptance provisions are long term in nature or are not included as standard terms of an arrangement or if we cannot reasonably estimate the incidence of returns  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of receipt of written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we also evaluate arrangements with governmental entities containing fiscal funding or termination for convenience provisions  when such provisions are required by law  to determine the probability of possible cancellation 
we consider multiple factors  including the history with the customer in similar transactions  the essential use of the software licenses and the planning  budgeting and approval processes undertaken by the governmental entity 
if we determine upon execution of these arrangements that the likelihood of cancellation is remote  we then recognize revenue once all of the criteria described above have been met 
if such a determination cannot be made  revenue is recognized upon the earlier of cash receipt or approval of the applicable funding provision by the governmental entity 
we assess whether fees are fixed or determinable at the time of sale and recognize revenue if all other revenue recognition requirements are met 
our standard payment terms are net  however  terms may vary based on the country in which the agreement is executed 
payments that are due within six months are generally deemed to be fixed or determinable based on our successful collection history on such arrangements  and thereby satisfy the required criteria for revenue recognition 
while most of our arrangements include short term payment terms  we have a standard practice of providing long term financing to credit worthy customers through our financing division 
since fiscal  when our financing division was formed  we have established a history of collection  without concessions  on these receivables with payment terms that generally extend up to five years from the contract date 
provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  we recognize new software license revenues for these arrangements upon delivery  net of any payment discounts from financing transactions 
we have generally sold receivables financed through our financing division on a non recourse basis to third party financing institutions 
we account for the sale of these receivables as true sales as defined in fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
our customers include several of our suppliers and on rare occasion  we have purchased goods or services for our operations from these vendors at or about the same time that we have licensed our software to these same companies a concurrent transaction 
software license agreements that occur within a three month time period from the date we have purchased goods or services from that same customer are reviewed for appropriate accounting treatment and disclosure 
when we acquire goods or services from a customer  we negotiate the purchase separately from any software license transaction  at terms we consider to be at arm s length  and settle the purchase in cash 
we 
table of contents recognize new software license revenue from concurrent transactions if all of our revenue recognition criteria are met and the goods and services acquired are necessary for our current operations 
business combinations in accordance with business combination accounting  we allocate the purchase price of acquired companies to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as to in process research and development based on their estimated fair values 
we engage third party appraisal firms to assist management in determining the fair values of certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
such valuations require management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to intangible assets 
management makes estimates of fair value based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable 
these estimates are based on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows from license sales  maintenance agreements  consulting contracts  customer contracts and acquired developed technologies and patents  expected costs to develop the in process research and development into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the projects when completed  the acquired company s brand and market position  as well as assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  and discount rates 
unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions  estimates or actual results 
in connection with purchase price allocations  we estimate the fair value of the support obligations assumed in connection with acquisitions 
the estimated fair value of the support obligations is determined utilizing a cost build up approach 
the cost build up approach determines fair value by estimating the costs related to fulfilling the obligations plus a normal profit margin 
the estimated costs to fulfill the support obligations are based on the historical direct costs related to providing the support services and to correct any errors in the software products acquired 
we do not include any costs associated with selling efforts or research and development or the related fulfillment margins on these costs 
profit associated with selling effort is excluded because the acquired entities would have concluded the selling effort on the support contracts prior to the acquisition date 
the estimated research and development costs are not included in the fair value determination  as these costs are not deemed to represent a legal obligation at the time of acquisition 
the sum of the costs and operating profit approximates  in theory  the amount that we would be required to pay a third party to assume the support obligation 
as a result  we did not recognize software license updates and product support revenues related to support contracts in the amount of million  million and million that would have been otherwise recorded by acquired businesses as independent entities in fiscal  and  respectively 
historically  substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their contracts when the contract is eligible for renewal 
to the extent these underlying support contracts are renewed  we will recognize the revenues for the full value of the support contracts over the support periods  the majority of which are one year 
had we included our estimated selling and research and development activities  and the associated margin for unspecified product upgrades and enhancements to be provided under our assumed support arrangements  the fair value of the support obligations would have been significantly higher than what we have recorded and we would have recorded a higher amount of software license updates and product support revenue historically and in future periods related to these assumed contracts 
other significant estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions include restructuring costs 
restructuring costs are primarily comprised of severance costs  costs of consolidating duplicate facilities and contract termination costs 
restructuring expenses are based upon plans that have been committed to by management but which are subject to refinement 
to estimate restructuring expenses  management utilizes assumptions of the number of employees that would be involuntarily terminated and of future costs to operate and eventually vacate duplicate facilities 
estimated restructuring expenses may change as management executes the approved plan 
decreases to the cost estimates of executing the currently approved plans associated with pre merger activities of the companies we acquire are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill indefinitely  whereas increases to the estimates are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill during the purchase price allocation period generally within one year of the acquisition date and as operating expenses thereafter 

table of contents for a given acquisition  we may identify certain pre acquisition contingencies 
if  during the purchase price allocation period  we are able to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will include that amount in the purchase price allocation 
if  as of the end of the purchase price allocation period  we are unable to determine the fair value of a pre acquisition contingency  we will evaluate whether to include an amount in the purchase price allocation based on whether it is probable a liability had been incurred and whether an amount can be reasonably estimated 
with the exception of unresolved tax matters  after the end of the purchase price allocation period  any adjustment to amounts recorded for a pre acquisition contingency will be included in our operating results in the period in which the adjustment is determined 
goodwill we review goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate its carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the provisions of statement require that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value 
our reporting units are consistent with the reportable segments identified in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is considered not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  then we must perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  then we would record an impairment loss equal to the difference 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  we make certain judgments and assumptions in allocating shared assets and liabilities to determine the carrying values for each of our reporting units 
our most recent annual goodwill impairment analysis  which was performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal  did not result in an impairment charge 
accounting for income taxes significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide income tax provision 
in the ordinary course of a global business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
some of these uncertainties arise as a consequence of revenue sharing and cost reimbursement arrangements among related entities  the process of identifying items of revenue and expense that qualify for preferential tax treatment  and segregation of foreign and domestic income and expense to avoid double taxation 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable  the final tax outcome of these matters could be different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
such differences could have a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be indefinitely reinvested outside the united states 
remittances of foreign earnings to the us are planned based on projected cash flow  working capital and investment needs of foreign and domestic operations 
based on these assumptions  we estimate the amount that will be distributed to the us and provide us federal taxes on these amounts 
material changes in our estimates could impact our effective tax rate 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in order for us to realize our deferred tax assets  we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in those jurisdictions where the deferred tax assets are located 
we consider future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which we operate and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax 
table of contents assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination 
likewise  if we later determine that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets would be realized  we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously provided valuation allowance 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provision based on estimates and assumptions that could differ from the actual results reflected in income tax returns filed during the subsequent year 
adjustments based on filed returns are generally recorded in the period when the tax returns are filed and the global tax implications are known 
the amount of income tax we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters 
however  our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved  audits are closed or when statutes of limitation on potential assessments expire 
additionally  the jurisdictions in which our earnings or deductions are realized may differ from our current estimates 
as a result  our effective tax rate may fluctuate significantly on a quarterly basis 
as part of our accounting for business combinations  some of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill and intangible assets 
impairment charges associated with goodwill are generally not tax deductible and will result in an increased effective income tax rate in the quarter the impairment is recorded 
amortization expenses associated with acquired intangible assets are generally not tax deductible pursuant to our existing tax structure  however  deferred taxes have been recorded for non deductible amortization expense as part of the purchase price allocation 
we have taken into account the allocation of these identified intangibles among different taxing jurisdictions  including those with nominal or zero percent tax rates  in establishing the related deferred tax liabilities 
income tax contingencies existing as of the acquisition dates of the acquired companies are evaluated quarterly and any adjustments are recorded as an adjustment to goodwill 
in fiscal  we will adopt fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
please refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
legal and other contingencies we are currently involved in various claims and legal proceedings 
quarterly  we review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we accrue a liability for the estimated loss 
significant judgment is required in both the determination of probability and the determination as to whether an exposure is reasonably estimable 
because of uncertainties related to these matters  accruals are based only on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending claims and litigation and may revise our estimates 
such revisions in the estimates of the potential liabilities could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
as a result of our acquisition of peoplesoft in fiscal  we inherited contingent liabilities resulting from a program peoplesoft had implemented prior to the consummation of our acquisition of peoplesoft referred to as the customer assurance program or cap 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
stock based compensation on june   we adopted statement no 
revised  share based payment  under the modified prospective method 
statement r generally requires share based payments to employees to be recognized in our consolidated statements of operations based on their fair values 
prior to june   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method of accounting as defined by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and applied the disclosure provisions of statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended 
under opinion  we generally did not recognize any compensation expense for stock options as the exercise price of our options was equivalent to the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
substantially all of our stock based compensation expense 
table of contents recognized under opinion related to options assumed from acquisitions 
for pro forma disclosures  the estimated fair values for options granted and options assumed were amortized using the accelerated expense attribution method 
in addition  we reduced pro forma stock compensation expense for actual forfeitures in the periods they occurred 
in march  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 which provides supplemental implementation guidance for statement r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of statement r 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the impact of our adoption of statement r and the assumptions we use to calculate the fair value of share based employee compensation 
upon our adoption of statement r  we were required to estimate the awards that we ultimately expect to vest and to reduce stock based compensation expense for the effects of estimated forfeitures of awards over the expense recognition period 
although we estimated forfeitures based on historical experience  forfeitures in the future may differ 
under statement r  the forfeiture rate must be revised if actual forfeitures differ from our original estimates 
also in connection with our adoption of statement r  we elected to recognize awards granted after our adoption date under the straight line amortization method 
we estimate the fair value of employee stock options using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of an award is affected by our stock price on the date of grant as well as other assumptions including the estimated volatility of our stock price over the term of the awards and the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon united states treasury interest rates appropriate for the expected life of the awards 
we use the implied volatility of our publicly traded stock options in order to estimate future stock price trends as we believe that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
in order to determine the estimated period of time that we expect employees to hold their stock options  we have used historical rates of employee groups by job classification 
our expected dividend rate is zero since we do not currently pay cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future 
we record deferred tax assets for stock based awards that result in deductions on our income tax returns  based on the amount of stock based compensation recognized and the statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which we will receive a tax deduction 
differences between the deferred tax assets recognized for financial reporting purposes and the actual tax deduction reported on our income tax returns are recorded in additional paid in capital 
if the tax deduction is less than the deferred tax asset  such shortfalls reduce our pool of excess tax benefits 
if the pool of excess tax benefits is reduced to zero  then subsequent shortfalls would increase our income tax expense 
our pool of excess tax benefits is computed in accordance with the alternative transition method as prescribed under fasb staff position fas r  transition election to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
the accounting guidance under statement r is relatively new and several interpretations have been released since the pronouncement has been issued 
additional interpretations may be released and the application of these principles may be subject to further refinement over time 
in addition  to the extent we change the terms of our employee stock based compensation programs  refine different assumptions in future periods such as forfeiture rates that differ from our estimates and implement the change in our expense attribution method from accelerated to straight line  which we elected when adopting statement r  the stock based compensation expense that we record in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded during our fiscal reporting periods 
allowances for doubtful accounts and returns we make judgments as to our ability to collect outstanding receivables and provide allowances for the portion of receivables when collection becomes doubtful 
provisions are made based upon a specific review of all significant outstanding invoices 
for those invoices not specifically reviewed  provisions are provided at differing rates  based upon the age of the receivable  the collection history associated with the geographic region that the receivable was recorded and current economic trends 
if the historical data we use to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions for doubtful accounts may be needed and the future results of operations could be materially affected 

table of contents we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales 
these estimates are based on historical sales returns  the volume and size of our larger transactions and other known factors 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
results of operations the comparability of our operating results in fiscal compared to fiscal is impacted by our acquisition of siebel in the third quarter of fiscal  the consolidation of i flex beginning june  beginning of fiscal and  to a lesser extent  the acquisition of hyperion in our fourth quarter of fiscal the comparability of our operating results in fiscal compared to fiscal is also impacted by acquisitions  principally our acquisition of peoplesoft in the third quarter of fiscal  and  to a lesser extent  the acquisitions of siebel in the third quarter of fiscal and retek  inc in the fourth quarter of fiscal in our discussion of changes in our results of operations from fiscal compared to fiscal  and fiscal compared to fiscal  we quantify the contribution of our acquired products to growth in new software license revenues  the amount of revenues associated with software license updates and product support as well as on demand services  and present supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting and stock based compensation where applicable 
although certain revenue contributions from our acquisitions are quantifiable  we are unable to identify the following the contribution of consulting and education services revenues from acquired companies in fiscal and with the exception of i flex and hyperion consulting revenues and hyperion education revenues for which we disclose the impact in fiscal in comparison to fiscal as the significant majority of these services have been fully integrated into our existing operations 
the contribution of expenses associated with acquired products and services in fiscal and with the exception of certain i flex and hyperion operating expenses for which we disclose the impact in fiscal in comparison to fiscal as the significant majority of these services have been fully integrated into our existing operations 
we caution readers that  while pre and post acquisition comparisons as well as the quantified amounts themselves may provide indications of general trends  the information has inherent limitations for the following reasons the quantifications cannot address the substantial effects attributable to our sales force integration efforts  in particular the effect of having a single sales force offer similar products 
the commissions earned by our integrated sales force generally do not vary based on the application product sold 
we believe that if our sales forces had not been integrated  the relative mix of products sold would have been different 
the significant majority of our acquisitions in the periods presented did not result in our entry into a new line of business or product category 
therefore  we provided multiple products with substantially similar features and functionality 
although substantially all of our customers  including customers from acquired companies  renew their software license updates and product support contracts when the contracts are eligible for renewal  amounts shown as support deferred revenue in our supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting and stock based compensation are not necessarily indicative of revenue improvements we will achieve upon contract renewal to the extent customers do not renew 
constant currency presentation we compare the percent change in the results from one period to another period in this annual report using constant currency disclosure 
we present constant currency information to provide a framework for assessing how our underlying businesses performed excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations 
to present this information  current and comparative prior period results for entities reporting in currencies other than united states dollars are converted into united states dollars at the exchange rate in effect on may   which was the 
table of contents last day of our prior fiscal year  rather than the actual exchange rates in effect during the respective periods 
for example  if an entity reporting in euros had revenues of million euros from products sold on may  and may   our financial statements would reflect revenues of million in fiscal using as the exchange rate and million in fiscal using as the exchange rate 
the constant currency presentation would translate the fiscal results using the fiscal exchange rate and indicate  in this example  no change in revenues during the periods 
in each of the tables below  we present the percent change based on actual results as reported and based on constant currency

total revenues were positively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of percentage points in fiscal due to the weakening of the united states dollar relative to other major international currencies 
excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations  new software license revenues contributed to the growth in total revenues  software license updates and product support revenues contributed and services contributed 
excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the americas contributed to the increase in total revenues  emea contributed and asia pacific contributed 
excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher salary and employee benefits associated with increased headcount levels primarily resulting from our acquisitions in fiscal and fiscal  as well as higher commissions and travel and entertainment expenses associated with both increased revenues and headcount levels 
in addition  operating expenses also increased in fiscal due to higher amortization costs of intangible assets and stock based compensation expenses related to our adoption of statement r 
operating expenses were negatively affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of percentage 
table of contents points 
the aforementioned increases in operating expenses were partially offset by lower restructuring expenses and the settlement of a pre acquisition peoplesoft related contingency that benefited our operating expenses see acquisition related charges discussion below 
operating margins as a percentage of total revenues were flat in fiscal and were favorably affected by foreign currency rate fluctuations of percentage points 
our revenues grew at a faster rate than our operating expenses  excluding amortization costs of intangible assets and stock based compensation expenses 
the increases in those cost categories offset the slower growth in other operating expenses 
international operations will continue to provide a significant portion of our total revenues 
as a result  total revenues and expenses will be affected by changes in the relative strength of the united states dollar against certain major international currencies 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues increased in fiscal due to strong sales execution  incremental revenues from acquisitions and a strengthening in our competitive position 
excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  software license updates and product support revenues contributed to the growth in total revenues  new software licenses contributed and services revenues contributed 
excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations  the americas contributed to the increase in total revenues  emea contributed and asia pacific contributed 
total revenues in the americas  specifically in the united states  increased at a faster rate than in other regions primarily due to the relative geographical mix of revenues from our acquired companies 
operating expenses were favorably affected by percentage point as a result of the strengthening of the united states dollar relative to other major international currencies 
excluding the effect of currency rate fluctuations  the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to higher headcount levels and associated personnel related costs in sales and marketing  consulting and research and development  higher commissions due to the increase in revenues and greater amortization of intangible assets  offset partially by lower restructuring and acquisition related expenses 
operating margins as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly in fiscal due to higher costs associated with acquisitions  principally amortization of intangible assets 
supplemental disclosure related to acquisition accounting and stock based compensation to supplement our consolidated financial information we believe the following information is helpful to an overall understanding of our past financial performance and prospects for the future

the weighted average interest rate earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities increased from in fiscal to in fiscal provision for income taxes the effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
the provision for income taxes differs from the tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state taxes and earnings considered as indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations 
future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates  by unfavorable changes in tax laws and regulations  or by adverse rulings in tax related litigation

our effective tax rate for fiscal was slightly lower than in fiscal primarily due to additional research and development tax credits as well as agreements reached with foreign tax authorities on certain tax positions 
fiscal compared to fiscal provision for income taxes increased in fiscal due to higher earnings before tax and a higher effective tax rate 
the increase in the effective tax rate in fiscal is primarily attributable to a higher percentage of earnings in high tax jurisdictions as compared with other lower tax rate jurisdictions

quarterly results of operations quarterly revenues and expenses have historically been affected by a variety of seasonal factors  including sales compensation plans 
these seasonal factors are common in the software industry 
these factors have caused a 
table of contents decrease in our first quarter revenues as compared to revenues in the immediately preceding fourth quarter  which historically has been the highest revenue quarter 
we expect this trend to continue in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  our european operations generally provide lower revenues in our first fiscal quarter because of the reduced economic activity in europe during the summer 
the following table sets forth selected unaudited quarterly information for our last eight fiscal quarters 
we believe that all necessary adjustments  which consisted only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the results of such periods when read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the sum of the quarterly financial information may vary from the annual data due to rounding

we recognize that options dilute existing stockholders and have sought to control the number of options granted while providing competitive compensation packages 
consistent with these dual goals  our cumulative potential dilution for each of the last three full fiscal years has been less than and has averaged per year 
the potential dilution percentage is calculated as the new option grants for the year including options assumed in acquisitions  net of options forfeited by employees leaving the company  divided by the total outstanding shares at the beginning of the year 
this maximum potential dilution will only result if all options are exercised 
some of these options  which have year exercise periods  have exercise prices substantially higher than the current market price 
at may   of our outstanding stock options had exercise prices in excess of the current market price 
consistent with our historical practices  we do not expect that dilution from future grants before the effect of our stock repurchase program will exceed per year for our ongoing business 
over the last years  our stock repurchase program has more than offset the dilutive effect of our stock option program  however  we may reduce the level of our stock repurchases in the future as we may use our available cash for acquisitions  to repay indebtedness or for other purposes 
at may   the maximum potential dilution from all outstanding and unexercised option awards  regardless of when granted and regardless of whether vested or unvested and including options where the strike price is higher than the current market price  was the compensation committee of the board of directors reviews and approves the organization wide stock option grants to selected employees  all stock option grants to executive officers and any individual stock option grants in excess of  shares

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest income rate risk 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we began designating newly acquired fixed income investments as available for sale 
as a result of the available for sale designation  all securities purchased after may  are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value 
as of may   substantially all investments held are classified as available for sale 
we generally purchase investments with relatively short maturities 
therefore  interest rate movements generally do not materially affect the valuation of our investments 
auction rate securities are reported on the balance sheet at par value  which equals market value  as the rate on such securities re sets generally every to days 
changes in the overall level of interest rates affect our interest income that is generated from our investments 
for fiscal  total interest income was million with investments yielding an average on a worldwide basis 
this interest rate level was up approximately basis points from for fiscal if overall interest rates fell by a similar amount basis points in fiscal  our interest income would decline by approximately million  assuming consistent investment levels

foreign currency transaction risk 
we transact business in various foreign currencies and have established a program that primarily utilizes foreign currency forward contracts to offset the risks associated with the effects of certain foreign currency exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency exposures are offset by gains or losses on the forward contracts  to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains or losses 
these foreign currency exposures typically arise from intercompany sublicense fees and other intercompany transactions 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all outstanding foreign currency forward contracts excluding our yen equity hedge described below are marked to market at the end of the period with unrealized gains and losses included in non operating income  net 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature
