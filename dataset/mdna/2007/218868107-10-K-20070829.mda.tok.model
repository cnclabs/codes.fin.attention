item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
background and overview as of june   we operated colleges  with more than  students  in states and the province of ontario  canada 
during the fiscal year ended june   the company had net revenues of million 
our revenues consist principally of student tuition and fees and are presented as net revenues after adjustments for refunds related to students who do not complete their courses 
we recognize revenues pro rata on a straight line basis over the relevant period attended by the student of the applicable course or program 
net revenues from continuing operations increased to million in from million in the increase is primarily due to a increase in the average revenue rate per student partially offset by a decrease in the average student population during the period 
the student population varies depending on  among other factors  the number of i continuing students at the beginning of a fiscal period  ii new student enrollments during the fiscal period  iii students who have previously withdrawn but who reenter during the fiscal period  and iv graduations and withdrawals during the fiscal period 
new student starts typically occur several times per month in the diploma granting colleges 
in the degree granting colleges  the majority of new student starts occur in the first month of each calendar quarter with an additional mini start in the second month of each quarter in most colleges 
the tuition charges vary by college depending on the local market  the program level diploma  associate s  bachelor s or master s degree and the specific curriculum 
the majority of students at our colleges rely on funds received under various government sponsored student financial aid programs to pay a substantial portion of their tuition and other education related expenses 
in fiscal  approximately of our net revenues  on a cash basis  were derived from federal student financial aid programs 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts on those financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to  those related to our allowance for doubtful accounts  insurance self insurance  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  contingencies and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or if our assumptions change 
our critical accounting estimates are those which we believe require our most significant judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
a discussion of our critical accounting estimates is as follows 
table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability  failure or refusal of our students to make required payments 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by regularly reviewing the accounts receivable aging and applying various expected loss percentages to certain student accounts receivable categories based upon historical bad debt experience 
we generally write off accounts receivable balances deemed uncollectible as they are sent to collection agencies 
we offer a variety of payment plans to help students pay that portion of their education expense not covered by financial aid programs 
these balances are unsecured and not guaranteed 
we believe our reserves are adequate  however  losses related to unpaid student balances could exceed the amounts we have reserved for bad debts 
many of our students in the us participate in federally guaranteed student loan programs 
the federally guaranteed student loans are authorized by the higher education act hea of and are guaranteed by an agency of the federal government 
the guaranteed loans are not guaranteed by us  and the guaranteed student loans cannot become an obligation of ours 
accordingly  we do not record an obligation to repay any of the guaranteed loans that are not repaid by our former students and we do not record either a contingent obligation or an allowance for future obligations as a result of student defaults of federally guaranteed student loans 
the guarantee of student loans is provided by an agency of the federal government  not by us 
if an institution s former students default rate on guaranteed loans cohort default rate equals or exceeds for three consecutive years  the institution may lose participation eligibility in the guaranteed loan program and its students would be denied access to the guaranteed loan program 
our institutions cohort default rates act as a gatekeeper to their eligibility to participate in the federal student financial aid programs 
we have no obligation to repay any of the federally guaranteed loans that our former students default upon  even if the cohort default rates of our students exceed permitted levels 
rather  if the cohort default rates at a particular institution exceed for three consecutive years  the institution s students may lose eligibility to receive federal student financial aid 
insurance self insurance 
we use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risks including claims related to employee heath care  workers compensation  general liability  and business interruption 
liabilities associated with these risks are estimated based on  among other things  historical claims experience  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 
the company s loss exposure related to self insurance is limited by stop loss coverage 
our expected loss accruals are based on estimates  and while we believe the amounts accrued are adequate  the ultimate loss may differ from the amounts provided 
goodwill and intangible assets 
we have significant goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair market value of net assets acquired  including identified intangible assets 
we consider a number of factors  including valuations and appraisals from independent valuation firms  in determining the amounts that are assignable to other intangible assets  such as curriculum  accreditation  and trade names 
we  however  are ultimately responsible for the valuations 
the fair value of identified intangible assets is derived using accepted valuation methodologies  including cost  market  and income approaches  as appropriate  following consultations with valuation firms and in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 and requirements set forth by the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice 
as of july   we ceased amortization of goodwill recorded in conjunction with past business combinations 
in addition  we conducted a review of our other identifiable intangible assets and determined that accreditation and trade names met the indefinite life criteria outlined in sfas no 
our review considered analysis of all pertinent factors  including the expected use of the asset  any legal  regulatory  or contractual provisions that may limit the useful life  the effects of obsolescence  demand  competition  and other economic factors  and the level of maintenance expenditures required to obtain the expected future cash flows from the asset 
accordingly  we also ceased amortization of the accreditation and trade names as of july  curricula continue to be amortized over their useful lives ranging generally from three to fifteen years and the amortization is included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
goodwill is tested annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  by comparing its fair value to its carrying amount at the reporting unit level as defined by sfas no 
we determined the fair value of our reporting units using the income approach that includes discounted cash flow as well as other generally accepted valuation methodologies 
to the extent the fair value of a reporting unit is less that the carrying amount of its assets  we record an impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations 
indefinite lived intangible assets are tested annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate potential impairment  by comparing their fair values to their carrying amounts 
to the extent the fair value of an intangible asset is less than its carrying amount  we record an impairment charge in the consolidated 
table of contents statements of operations 
for instance  if we were to discontinue the use of a trade name or lose accreditation at one or more of our acquired schools to which we have ascribed value for trade names and accreditation  we would test the amounts we have allocated to such assets for impairment 
such testing would include estimating the future cash flows expected to be received from the trade names and accreditation and comparing them to their carrying values 
if our estimate of the present value of these future cash flows were below the carrying values of the related assets  we would consider the assets to be impaired and take a charge against the amounts we had allocated to trade names and accreditation 
the determination of related estimated useful lives of intangible assets and whether or not these intangible assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
although we believe our goodwill and intangible assets are fairly stated  changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to asset balances 
discontinued operations 
during the fourth quarter of  the company decided to divest all of its cdi campuses outside of the province of ontario  canada as well as the wyotech boston campus the sale group 
the company will continue to operate and invest in the campuses within the sale group until the schools and campuses are sold 
each of the campuses within the sale group is available for immediate sale in its present condition  and we expect to complete the sale of the campuses and schools in fiscal we expect to have no significant continuing involvement with the schools after they have been sold 
we believe that the schools and campuses within the sale group meet the criteria necessary for such entities to qualify as assets held for sale under the specific provision of sfas accordingly  the results of operations of the schools and campuses within the sale group are reflected as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of income for all periods presented 
additionally  in accordance with sfas  as we expect to complete the sale plan within a year  assets and liabilities of the schools and campuses within the sale group are reflected as current assets held for sale and current liabilities held for sale on our consolidated balance sheet as of june  under sfas  the net assets held for sale are required to be recorded on the balance sheet at estimated fair value  less costs to sell 
accordingly  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of approximately million  net of income tax benefit of million  to reduce the carrying value of the net assets of our schools and campuses held for sale to estimated fair value  less costs to sell  as of june  primarily related to the impairment of goodwill in the amount of million for the divested cdi schools 
the charge is reflected as a component of loss from discontinued operations on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  deferred taxes 
we currently have deferred income tax assets which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that more likely than not will be realized 
realization of our deferred income tax assets is principally dependent upon achievement of projected future taxable income offset by deferred income tax liabilities 
we evaluate the realizability of our deferred income tax assets annually 
contingencies 
in the ordinary conduct of the business  we are subject to occasional lawsuits  investigations and claims  including  but not limited to  claims involving students and graduates and routine employment matters 
when we are aware of a claim or potential claim  we assess the likelihood of any loss or exposure 
if it is probable that a loss will result and the amount of the loss can reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the loss 
if the loss is not probable or the amount of the loss cannot be reasonably estimated  we disclose the nature of the specific claim if the likelihood of a potential loss is reasonably possible and the amount involved is material 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of any of the matters disclosed will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
stock based compensation

revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  supercedes apb opinion no

r requires companies to measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record such expense in its consolidated financial statements 
in addition  the adoption of sfas no 
r requires additional accounting and disclosure related to the income tax and cash flow effects resulting from share based payment arrangements 
sfas no 
r is effective beginning as of the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  accordingly  we adopted sfas no 
r during the first quarter of fiscal in accordance with the modified perspective transition method and began recognizing compensation expense for stock options which vested during the year

seasonality and other factors affecting quarterly results our revenues normally fluctuate as a result of seasonal variations in our business 
student population varies as a result of new student enrollments and student attrition 
historically  our colleges  schools and training centers have had lower student populations in the first fiscal quarter than in the remainder of the year 
our expenses  however  do not vary as significantly as student population and revenues 
we expect quarterly fluctuations in operating results to continue as a result of seasonal enrollment patterns 
such patterns may change  however  as a result of acquisitions  new branch openings  new program adoptions and increased enrollments from recent high school graduates 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period
