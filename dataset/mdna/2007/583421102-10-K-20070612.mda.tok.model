item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors 
our fiscal year begins on april and ends on march references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  and references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  overview the company is a global leader in the design and manufacture of sensors and sensor based systems for original equipment manufacturers and end users 
the company continues to expand the business at a relatively high rate through organic growth and through acquisitions 
with the sale of our consumer business effective december   the company had one reportable segment during and  formerly the sensor division 
accordingly  all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for each of the fiscal periods ended march   and exclude the results of discontinued operations  except as otherwise noted 
we have eight primary manufacturing facilities strategically located in the united states  china  france  germany and ireland  enabling the company to produce and market world wide a broad range of sensors that use advanced technologies to measure precise ranges of physical characteristics including pressure  position  force  vibration  humidity  temperature and photo optics 
these sensors are used for industrial  automotive  medical  consumer and military aerospace applications 
the company s sensor products include pressure and electromagnetic displacement sensors  transducers  piezoelectric polymer film sensors  custom microstructures  load cells  accelerometers  optical sensors  humidity and temperature sensors 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items in our consolidated statements of income as a percentage of net sales for the years ended march  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses selling  general  and administrative non cash equity based compensation sfas r amortization of acquired intangibles litigation settlment expenses total operating expenses operating income interest expense  net other expense income income from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes minority interest  net of income taxes income tax expense from continuing operations income from continuing operations discontinued operations income from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax expense from discontinued operations income from discontinued operations  before gain gain on disposition of discontinued operations net of income tax income from discontinued operations net income executive summary the company has seen a significant amount of change over the last several years 
in may  we embarked upon an aggressive restructuring effort to improve the operating performance of the company 
a key component of this restructuring was the elimination of underutilized facilities to consolidate our operations in shenzhen  china and hampton  virginia 
in fiscal year  the company made the strategic decision to focus on aggressively growing the sensor division through acquisition and organic growth 
to that end  the company made eight acquisitions during fiscal and  and two acquisitions in fiscal the acquisitions see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
the results of operations of these acquisitions are included in our consolidated statement of operations as of and since their respective dates of purchase 
to finance the acquisitions  we expanded our  credit facility to  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
having completed the restructuring and acquisitions  the company is now a global sensor solutions company with a broad range of technologies and capabilities 
our focus remains on engineered solutions where we can use our engineering and manufacturing talent and depth of knowledge and experience in sensors to provide a complete solution to our customers  as well as bundle products together 
we also have a substantial end user business for high quality off the shelf sensors and transducers used for test  instrumentation and process control 
a key to our manufacturing strategy is leveraging the significant infrastructure we now have in shenzhen  china 
this infrastructure has enabled us to reduce costs and improve financial performance while continuing to provide our customers with low cost  highly reliable products 
growth strategy having divested the low margin consumer business  the company is now wholly engaged in pursuing aggressive growth in the sensor business  with an established goal of achieving annual revenues of  by the end of fiscal year from fiscal to fiscal  the company has grown annual revenues at a compound annual growth rate cagr through a combination of organic growth and acquisitions 
to achieve our fiscal sales goal  the company is targeting an average annual organic growth of  which is consistent with historical demonstrated performance 
the company targets custom engineered medium to high volume oem applications for which the typical development cycle lasts from to months 
in addition to the company s traditional oem business  the company has a growing end user business as a result of recent acquisitions 
accelerometers  pressure transducers  linear variable differential transformers lvdts and derivative linear displacement products made by the company are all used by customers for applications in test and measurement  instrumentation and process control 
these devices are packaged products sense elements with amplification  compensation and sometimes value added which carry a higher average selling price 
the company is pursuing these sales through direct selling to high volume users  new distribution channels to small and medium volume users including private label agreements with established brands and through e commerce on its own website 
in addition to the organic growth  management still believes there is room on the balance sheet to support the leveraged acquisition of companies that can provide entry into new technologies  geographies and customer segments 
the company will continue to pursue acquisitions that make a good strategic fit without specific timetables for closure 
work continues on integrating acquisitions for inherent synergies in sales and marketing  engineering and manufacturing 
to improve the ownership and accountability on top to bottom results  the company has recently organized the eight product families into four business groups  with each group having responsibility for sales  engineering  operations and customer service of their respective products 
a group vice president has been assigned overall strategic and profit loss responsibility for the particular group  with finance accounting  supply chain information systems and strategic sourcing remaining functional  shared resources 
the organization of each group  and associated group vp is as follows pfg glen macgibbon pressure force pvg vic chatigny position vibration piezo tpg terence monaghan temperature optical hcg jean francois allier humidity chemical gas we have been finalizing and testing this structure in fourth fiscal quarter of  and will officially operate under this organization in fiscal trends 
we are expecting to maintain our organic and overall growth rates in net sales to meet or exceed the forecasted annual revenues of  by the end of fiscal additionally  sales and results of operations could be impacted by additional acquisitions  though there is no specific timetable for such transactions 
we anticipate our overall average gross margins for our sensor business to stay within a range of approximately to in fiscal year as compared to gross margins of and for fiscal years and  respectively 
there are several factors impacting margins  including sales growth strategies  product sales mix  exchange rates and our overall cost structure 
the sensors market is highly fragmented with hundreds of niche players 
while the worldwide sensors market that we serve is expected to have a cagr  we expect to gain share and grow our sensor business through our willingness to customize  broad technology portfolio and through our cost competitive structure 
as a result of this growth strategy  we anticipate pursuing larger programs that may carry lower gross margins than our historical business  which could influence our overall sensor gross margins 
the growth of our automotive applications would be an example of such a business 
the continued appreciation of the chinese renminbi rmb relative to the us dollar has resulted in lower margins since a large portion of our products is manufactured in our china facility  where a large volume of our costs are denominated in rmb but sold in us dollars 
similarly  depreciation of the euro relative to the dollar could create similar pressure on gross margins on products sold in europe 
the company continually monitors costs and pursues various cost control measures and sales initiatives to improve margins to offset increases to the aforementioned items impacting our margins 
while we expect gross margin to slowly decline as compared to previous years  we expect operating margin to improve as a result of improved selling  general and administrative expenses ie  sga leverage 
sga as a percent of net sales have declined to in fiscal  as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
it is through this leverage of operating expenses that we expect to realize improved overall operating margin 
certain expenses are expected to increase  including income taxes  applications engineering and development expenses and compensation expense associated with our variable compensation plan  which are anticipated to be partially offset by decreases in amortization of acquired intangible assets and interest expense 
the decrease in income tax expense is primarily a function of a lower overall effective tax rate due to a larger portion of anticipated earnings to taxing jurisdictions with lower tax rates and the recently announced increase in the china tax rate from to effective january the impact of the increase in the china tax rate during the year ended march  resulted in a decrease in income tax of approximately due to the calculation of the deferred tax assets at the higher rate 
the increased applications engineering and development costs reflect the company s continued focus on developing new innovative products through internal research and development  and certain identified programs which are forecasted to result in higher expenses in prior to generating sales revenue 
under the previous profit sharing incentive plan  the company did not make any accruals during the first half of fiscal  however  with modifications to the plan  the company accrued certain amounts during the second half of fiscal  and such accruals are expected to continue throughout we expect modest declines in amortization of acquired intangibles and interest expense in future quarters as compared to the previous quarters 
the company s operations are expected to support these higher costs and generate sufficient cash flows to both service and reduce our debt 
foreign currency exchange gains and losses will impact the financial results of the company due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  especially with the rmb and euro  which are likely to continue to fluctuate 
the company has implemented certain risk management and hedging strategies and the company closely monitors exchange rates  but there is no assurance that such financial impact will be mitigated 
the company currently manufactures from a leased facility in china 
in order to  among other things  control costs and to provide reliable and adequate capacity  the company is in the process of building a factory in china to replace the current leased facility 
the overall cost of the factory is expected to be in the range of  to  and should be constructed over the next year 
in connection with the construction of the new facility  on march   the company entered into a definitive year lease agreement for land in shenzhen  guang dong province  china for a total cost of approximately the company broke ground and began construction in march the company plans to finance the new facility through a combination of sources  including cash generated from operations and through additional borrowings

recent accounting pronouncements recently adopted accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r revised  share based payment 
sfas r requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements  rather than disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
effective april   the company adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method as disclosed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements include in the annual report on form k 
on november   the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory cost an amendment of arb no 
 chapter this new standard is the result of a broader effort by the fasb to improve financial reporting by eliminating differences between generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states and gaap developed by the international accounting standards board iasb 
as part of this effort  the fasb and the iasb identified opportunities to improve financial reporting by eliminating certain narrow differences between their existing accounting standards 
sfas no 
clarifies that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and spoilage should be expensed as incurred and not included in overhead 
further  sfas no 
requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to conversion costs should be based on normal capacity of the production facilities 
the provisions in sfas no 
are effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after june  companies must apply the standard prospectively 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect the company s financial position or results of operations 
effective april   the company adopted disclosure requirements of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement  for tax receipts on the face of their income statements 
the scope of this guidance includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer and may include  but is not limited to  sales  use  value added and some excise taxes 
the company has historically presented such taxes on a net basis in net sales 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
this new standard replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and represents another step in the fasb s goal to converge its standards with those issued by the iasb 
among other changes  sfas no 
requires that a voluntary change in accounting principle be applied retrospectively with all prior period financial statements presented on the new accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas no 
also provides that a change in method of depreciating or amortizing a long lived non financial asset be accounted for as a change in estimate prospectively that was effected by a change in accounting principle  and correction of errors in previously issued financial statements should be termed a restatement 
the new standard is effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption of this standard is permitted for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on september   the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin sab topic no 
 financial statements considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses how a registrant should evaluate whether an error in its financial statements is material 
the sec staff concluded in sab that materiality should be evaluated using both the rollover and iron curtain methods 
registrants are required to comply with the guidance in sab in financial statements for fiscal years ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued no 
 fair value measurements 
this new standard provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
the fasb believes the standard also responds to investors requests for expanded information about the extent to which companies measure assets and liabilities at fair value  the information used to measure fair value  and the effect of fair value measurements on earnings 
sfas applies whenever other standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value in any new circumstances 
currently  over accounting standards within gaap require or permit entities to measure assets and liabilities at fair value 
prior to sfas  the methods for measuring fair value were diverse and inconsistent  especially for items that are not actively traded 
the standard clarifies that for items that are not actively traded  such as certain kinds of derivatives  fair value should reflect the price in a transaction with a market participant  including an adjustment for risk  not just the company s mark to market value 
sfas also requires expanded disclosure of the effect on earnings for items measured using unobservable data 
under sfas  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the market in which the reporting entity transacts 
in this standard  the fasb clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
in support of this principle  sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
under the standard  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
earlier application is encouraged  provided that the reporting entity has not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including any financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
the company is currently quantifying the impact of sfas no 
on july   financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 was issued 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the new fasb standard also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with fin is a two step process 
the first step is a recognition process whereby the enterprise determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  the enterprise should presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is a measurement process whereby a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is calculated to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the provisions of fin are effective for fiscal years beginning after december  earlier application is permitted as long as the enterprise has not yet issued financial statements  including interim financial statements  in the period of adoption 
the provisions of fin are to be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of this standard 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized or continue to be recognized upon adoption of fin the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin should be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings or other appropriate components of equity or net assets in the statement of financial position for that fiscal year 
the company is in the process of assessing the impact of adopting fin  but based on preliminary procedures  the company does not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on its results of operations and financial condition 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when earned  which occurs when the following four conditions are met i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectability is reasonably assured 
certain products may be sold with a provision allowing the customer to return a portion of products 
the company provides for allowances for returns based upon historical and estimated return rates 
the amount of actual returns could differ from estimates 
changes in estimated returns would be accounted for in the period of change 
the company utilizes manufacturing representatives as sales agents for certain of its products 
such representatives do not receive orders directly from customers  take title to or physical possession of products  or invoice customers 
accordingly  revenue is recognized upon shipment to the customer 
on january   conair corporation purchased certain assets of the company s thinner branded bathroom and kitchen scale business  including worldwide rights to the thinner brand name and exclusive rights to the thinner designs in north america 
the company has accounted for the sale of this business under the guidance of eitf as a significant portion of the proceeds from the sale was in fact an up front payment for future lost margins  the majority of the gain on sale has been deferred and was amortized into revenues in future periods over the estimated remaining lives for those products sold to conair 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company included in this annual report on form k for a discussion of the sale of the business to conair 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the majority of the company s accounts receivable is due from manufacturers of electronic  automotive  military and industrial products 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer s financial condition and  generally  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of allowances for doubtful accounts and other sales allowances 
accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
amounts collected on trade accounts receivable are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
actual uncollectible accounts could exceed the company s estimates and changes to its estimates will be accounted for in the period of change 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm 
for purposes of analyzing the lcm  market is current replacement cost 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates historical cost 
market cannot exceed the net realizable value ie  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predicted costs of completion and disposal and market shall not be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin 
in evaluating lcm  management also considers  if applicable  other factors as well  including known trends  market conditions  currency exchange rates and other such issues 
if the utility of goods is impaired by damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in price levels or other causes  a loss shall be charged as cost of sales in the period which it occurs 
the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to our operations include slowdown in customer demand  customer delay in the issuance of sales orders  miscalculation of customer requirements  technology changes that render raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders 
the company establishes reserves for its inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
products that have existed in inventory for one calendar year with no usage and that have no current demand or no expected demand  will be considered obsolete and reserved 
obsolete inventory approved for disposal is written off against the reserve 
furthermore  consideration is given to ultimate circumstances when recording inventory reserves and the disposal of inventory considered obsolete 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters  which would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may result in additional inventory reserves and write downs  which would be accounted for in the period of change 
the level of inventory reserves reflects the nature of the industry whereby technological and other changes  such as customer buying requirements  result in impairment of inventory 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
as of march   the company has tested its goodwill for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
 and no impairment charges were deemed necessary 
see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company included in this annual report on form k for further discussion of the impact of sfas no 
on the company s financial position and results of operations 
per sfas no 
 management assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis at fiscal year end or more frequently under certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit  and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  the fair value of the company s reporting unit exceeded its carrying value in the fiscal years ended march   and  and accordingly  there was no impairment of the company s goodwill 
acquisitions acquisitions are recorded as of the purchase date  and are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
in all acquisitions  the purchase price of the acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of the acquisition 
the fair values of these items are based upon management s best estimates 
certain of the acquired assets are intangible in nature  including customer relationships  patented and proprietary technology  covenants not to compete  trade names and order backlog  which are stated at purchase date fair value less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess purchase price over the amounts allocated to the assets is recorded as goodwill 
all such valuation methodologies  including the determination of subsequent amortization periods  involve significant judgments and estimates 
different assumptions and subsequent actual events could yield materially different results 
purchased intangibles and goodwill are usually not deductible for tax purposes with stock acquisitions 
however  purchase accounting requires for the establishment of deferred tax liabilities on purchased intangible assets excluding goodwill to the extent the carrying value for the financial reporting exceeds the tax basis 
long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets and purchased intangible assets subject to amortization in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal or long lived assets 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the consolidated balance sheets and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the consolidated balance sheets 
management assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and a change in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed using a projected discounted cash flow method at the lowest level at which cash flows is identifiable 
in the event impairment is indicated  fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method  appraisal or other accepted techniques 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
other factors could include  among other things  quoted market prices  or other valuation techniques considered appropriate based on the circumstances 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  an impairment charge may need to be recorded 
impairment charges would be included in our consolidated statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
this process was completed in the fiscal years ended march   and for asset values as of these respective dates 
according to the guidelines established under sfas  there was no impairment 
foreign currency translation and transactions the functional currency of the company s foreign operations is the applicable local currency 
the foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their operations are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
accumulated comprehensive income loss consists of net income for the period and the cumulative impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 
the company is subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currency denominated transactions  such as receivables and payables 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in other income and expenses in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent on generating future taxable income  which is reviewed annually 
the company evaluates all positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required 
consideration of current and expected results of the company  as well as the status of litigation  indicated that a valuation allowance is not needed 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements of the company in this annual report on form k for a discussion regarding income taxes and the status of the company s litigation 
the company annually evaluates positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is required 
this evaluation is primarily based upon projected future earnings and various tax strategies 
transfer pricing refers to the prices that one member of a group of related companies charges to another member of the group for goods  services  or the use of intellectual property 
if two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries  the laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those charged by unrelated companies dealing with each other at arm s length 
if one or more of the countries in which our affiliated companies are located believes that transfer prices were manipulated by our affiliate companies in a way that distorts the true taxable income of the companies  the laws of countries where our affiliated companies are located could require us to redetermine transfer prices and thereby reallocate the income of our affiliate companies in order to reflect these transfer prices 
any reallocation of income from one of our companies in a lower tax jurisdiction to an affiliated company in a higher tax jurisdiction would result in a higher overall tax liability to us 
moreover  if the country from which the income is being reallocated does not agree to the reallocation  the same income could be subject to taxation by both countries 
warranty reserve the company s sensor products generally are marketed to end users under warranties of up to one year 
factors affecting the company s warranty liability include the number of products sold and historical and anticipated rates of claims and cost per claim 
the company provides for estimated product warranty obligations at the time of sale  based on its historical warranty claims experience and assumptions about future warranty claims 
this estimate is susceptible to changes in the near term based on introductions of new products  product quality improvements and changes in end user application and or behavior 
contingencies and litigation liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimates that we may have made with respect to their resolution 
stock based compensation the company has three active share based compensation plans  which are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company in this annual report on form k 
prior to fiscal  the company applied the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants to employees 
there was no employee compensation expense recognized in the income from continuing operations in fiscal and as a result of options issued to employees 
effective april   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  utilizing the modified prospective approach 
this statement replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb under the modified prospective approach  sfas r applies to new awards and to awards that were outstanding and not vested on april   as well as those that are subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
under the modified prospective approach  compensation cost recognized in the year ended march  includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to april   based on the grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
prior periods were not restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard 
the company receives a tax deduction for certain stock options and stock option exercises during the period the options are exercised  generally for the excess of the fair value of the stock over the exercise price of the options at the exercise date 
prior to adoption of sfas r  the company reported all tax benefits resulting from the award of equity instruments as operating cash flows in its consolidated statements of cash flows 
in accordance with sfas r  the company is required to report excess tax benefits from the award of equity instruments as financing cash flows 
since the company is currently in a net operating loss carry forward position  the company applies the tax law ordering approach  whereby the tax benefits are considered realized for current year exercises of share based compensation awards 
these amounts are considered realized because such deductions offset taxable income on the company s tax return  thereby reducing the amount of income subject to tax 
the current year stock compensation deduction is used to offset taxable income before the nol carry forwards because all current year deductions take priority over nol carry forwards 
when the tax deduction exceeds the compensation expense  the tax benefit associated with any excess deduction is considered an excess tax benefit  or windfall 
the windfall portion of the share based compensation deduction reduces income tax payable and is credited to additional paid in capital apic 
the windfall credited to apic increases the company s apic pool available to offset future tax deficiencies shortfalls 
shortfalls are the amount the compensation expense exceeds the tax deduction

consolidated net sales hit a record annual level in fiscal  and increased  or from  to  net sales from and acquisitions totaled  and organic net sales increased  or  defined as organic growth 
the strong organic growth for the year was primarily the result of growth in sales with our largest customer  sensata  as well as higher sales in the piezo panels  force  optical  humidity and vibration product lines 
growth with sensata was primarily a result of their continued penetration of sensors used in electronic stability control esc systems and direct gas injection applications  as well as the introduction of force sensors used in occupant weight sensing  all of which utilize the company s proprietary micro fused technology 
we enjoyed strong growth in our humidity products  largely as a result of continued penetration of windshield fogging prevention applications  as well as diesel engine management applications for heavy truck and off road equipment 
growth in our piezo panels product line was primarily due to strong sales of sensors used in medical applications and computer business equipment products as compared to last year  as well as strong sales of our recently introduced penetration panels used in security applications and our piezo based traffic sensors 
optical sales increased reflecting higher order demand and broader adoption by a number of medical end use customers 
growth in our vibration products reflected our continued success with our newly introduced line of accelerometers targeting the automotive crash test market and vibration monitoring applications 
finally  with the sale of the consumer business  the sale of our load cells for consumer scale applications are now included in our third party sensor sales  boosting sales for our force products 
overall  we expect net sales to continue to grow based on our sales growth strategies with high volume sensor business  and organic growth with new and existing products 
gross margin 
overall  gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decline in margin is primarily due to sales mix  resulting from  among other things  higher sales with our largest customer  sensata  which serves the automotive market and carries lower gross margin than our average  as well as increased optical sales which also carry a lower gross margin 
additionally  we have moved selected low volume  high pressure and or difficult to manufacture oil filled products from our china operation to the fremont operation which has decreased the gross margin in the pressure line  but should result in improved service to our customers 
the change in exchange rate of the rmb relative to the us dollar  along with increased commodity costs  also negatively impacted margins 
on an ongoing basis our gross margin for sensors will fluctuate due to product mix  sales volume  raw material costs  foreign currency exchange rates and other such factors 
the increases in costs should be partially offset by sales growth in oem platforms for automotive and in medical applications  increased prices and improved supply chain dynamics 
overall  margins are expected to remain within a range to next fiscal year 
operating expense 
operating expenses increased  from  to  as a percent of net sales  operating expense declined to from 
approximately  of the  increase was associated with companies acquired in fiscal or  as well as the increase in stock based compensation expense of  with the adoption of sfas r   increase in amortization of acquired intangible assets  approximately  of compensation expense under the incentive compensation plan and  in costs associated with the settlement of legal matters 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  which includes application and development engineering expense  increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a decreased from to of net sales 
approximately  of the increase in sg a reflects the impact of sg a due to acquired companies 
the majority of the remaining increase is associated with the approximately  incentive compensation expense in fiscal litigation settlement expenses 
at march   the company accrued  in litigation settlement expenses associated with the settlement of the dewelt and samuel litigation see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report filed on form k 
additionally  the company incurred approximately in legal fees during specifically associated with these two matters which are included in sg a expenses and not included in the litigation settlement expenses 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
the  increase in amortization of acquired intangibles subject to amortization to  for the year ended march   directly relates to the increase in acquired intangible assets and the timing of the acquisitions 
effective april   the company purchased ysi temperature and betatherm  and approximately  in acquired intangible assets were assigned as part of these two acquisitions 
the amortization of intangibles for represents a full year of amortization 
acquisitions in fiscal were effective at different dates and at the end of fiscal  and the prior year amortization was lower because it did not represent a full twelve months of amortization of acquired intangible assets 
interest expense  net 
the  increase in interest expense to  for the year ended march  is primarily attributed to the increase in average debt outstanding 
overall  average borrowings during fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal average interest rates decreased to from 
the increase in debt was due to the acquisitions 
other expense income  net 
other expense increased to for the year ended march  from for the same period last year 
the fluctuation is mainly attributed to the increase in foreign currency exchange losses of approximately during fiscal  as compared to the prior year  which was mostly due to the change in the rmb exchange rate relative to the us dollar 
income taxes 
our overall effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately during the year ended march   as compared to last year 
the overall decrease in the effective income tax rate reflects certain adjustments recorded during the prior year increasing income tax expenses and a higher portion of taxable income earned during the current fiscal year in tax jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a adjustment  which increased income tax expense  to revalue us net deferred tax assets based on a lower estimated us effective tax rate resulting from larger apportionment to a state with a lower tax rate 
the impact of the adjustments recorded during the prior year increased the overall tax rate by points 
the company s overall effective rate in was impacted by a higher portion of taxable income earned in tax jurisdictions with lower tax rates 
the statutory tax rates for trading operations in china and ireland are and  respectively 
additionally  there was a decrease in profitability in the us  which carries a higher tax rate  with the added operating expenses associated with the implementation of sfas r  litigation settlement charges and higher interest expense 
more than offsetting the impact of the jurisdictions with lower tax rates  the company accrued an additional in income tax expense during the quarter ended march  in conjunction with the finalization of the betatherm reorganization in the fourth quarter  and the evaluation of the final structure and tax elections 
due to  among other things  the volume of manufacturing in the us and our net operating loss carry forwards  we do not expect the american jobs creation act of to have an immediate or significant impact on our effective tax rates 
discontinued operations 
as part of the sale agreement of the consumer products segment to fervent group limited fgl  the company could have earned an additional  if certain performance criteria sales and margin targets were met within the first year

the company sold the consumer business effective december   and accordingly  the consumer business is classified as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial results for all periods presented 
net sales 
net sales for increased  or from  to  net sales from fiscal and fiscal acquisitions totaled  and  respectively  and organic net sales increased  or 
the increase in net sales in the fiscal year ended march  is primarily the result of increased demand in our pressure  force  humidity  piezo film and traffic sensor product lines 
contributing significantly to the growth of pressure and humidity lines was continued expansion of existing and new platforms in automotive and off road vehicles 
the company s pressure products were also capturing increasing market share in medical applications 
piezo film growth was occurring in the consumer goods applications and in anti tamper devices used in encryption security and in automatic teller machines atms 
gross margin 
overall  gross margin decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  gross margin as a percent of net sales for our base sensor business which excludes the effects of acquisitions in and decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decline in our overall margins and margins of our traditional sensor business was due to several factors  including acquisitions and a shift in sales to products with lower margins and reductions in pricing to secure a higher volume of business  as well as the impact of the appreciation of the rmb 
operating expense 
operating expenses in increased  or from  to  primarily as a result of the acquisitions 
as a percent of net sales  operating expense declined to from 
approximately  of the  increase was associated with companies acquired in fiscal  as well as the increase in wages to support the increase in sales 
selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses increased  or from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase in sg a costs mainly reflect the impact of the acquisitions and related integration costs  and additional sales and engineering staff to support higher sales 
as a percentage of net sales  sg a costs actually declined from to  reflecting net sales increasing at a higher rate than costs  improved leverage by consolidating operations  and various cost control measures  including lower employee profit sharing and lower professional fees 
the prior year s professional fees were higher than normal primarily because of the costs associated with the initial implementation of sarbanes oxley requirements 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
the increase in amortization of acquired intangibles subject to amortization to  for the year ended march  directly relates to the acquisitions and the timing of the acquisitions 
the amortization for represents a full year of amortization for the intangibles from the acquisitions occurring in fiscal  since the acquisitions were effective at different dates throughout the prior year amortization does not represent a full twelve months of amortization 
interest expense  net 
the  increase in interest expense to  for the year ended march  is primarily attributable to the increase in average debt outstanding and an increase in interest rates 
overall  average borrowings during fiscal increased to  from  for fiscal average interest rates increased to from 
the increase in debt was due to the acquisitions 
other expense income  net 
other expense income fluctuated to an expense of for the year ended march  from income of for the prior fiscal year 
the fluctuation to an expense from income is mainly attributed to the foreign currency exchange loss of approximately incurred during fiscal  which was mainly due to the change in the rmb rate relative to the us dollar 
income taxes 
our overall effective tax rate from continuing operations was approximately during the year ended march  partially offsetting the impact of the of the adjustments noted below which increased income tax expense and our overall tax rate  the shift in earnings before taxes to jurisdictions with lower tax rates contributed to lowering our tax rate 
there was an adjustment of approximately during that increased income tax expenses 
this adjustment was the revaluation of the related us net deferred tax assets based on a lower estimated effective us tax rate 
the lower overall us effective tax rate was the result of a larger apportionment to a state with a lower tax rate  which was mainly due to centralizing the company s principal headquarters and much of the manufacturing operations in the us to hampton  virginia from new jersey 
as a result of this change in apportionment  the effective tax rate in the united states decreased from to approximately 
the shift in earnings can be attributed to  among other things  the changes in our business with the sale of the consumer business and the impact of the acquisitions during the two prior years  specifically with regard to the amortization of acquired intangibles and higher interest expense 
discontinued operations 
the income from discontinued operations for the fiscal year ended march  consists of the gain from the sale of the consumer business and the income from the consumer business prior to the sale 
aside from this gain  income from discontinued operations was relatively flat year over year  reflecting slightly higher income in fiscal the higher income in fiscal is the result of higher bathroom scale sales 
liquidity and capital resources operating working capital for continuing operations accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable increased by  from  as of march  to  as of march  as a percent of net sales  operating working capital decreased slightly to at march  from at march  the overall increase in operating working capital was attributable to the increase in accounts receivable of  from  at march  to  at march   an increase in inventory of  from  at march  to  at march   and slightly offset by the  increase in accounts payable from  at march  to  at march  the increases in the respective balance sheet accounts  including accounts receivable  inventory and accounts payable  are due mainly to the acquisitions  as well as to support increased sales 
the company acquired operating working capital of  effective april  with the purchase of betatherm and ysi temperature 
cash provided from operating activities was  for the year ended march   as compared to  provided for the fiscal year ended march  the  increase in cash provided by operations is mainly due to the increase in income from continuing operations 
the total of all adjustments to reconcile income from continuing operations to net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was a net use of cash of  for the year ended march   representing the uses of cash from such items as increases in receivables and inventories  which were mostly offset by the net cash provided from such items as increases in trade payables and the adjustments for depreciation and non cash equity compensation 
net cash used in investing activities was  for the year ended march  as compared to  relative to the corresponding period last year 
the increase in net cash used in investing activities is primarily due to the acquisitions of ysi temperature and betatherm  which were much larger acquisitions than hlp and atex during the prior year 
in addition  capital spending decreased to  for the year ended march  from  for the twelve months ended march  financing activities for the year ended march  provided  of net cash mainly reflecting the net proceeds from the amended and expanded credit facilities and short term debt 
long term debt to support the financing of the acquisitions of ysi temperature and betatherm see note to the consolidated financial statements of the company included in this annual report on form k  effective april   the company entered into an amended and restated credit agreement amended credit facility with gecc which  among other things  increased the company s existing credit facility from  to  and lowered the applicable libor or index margin from and  respectively  to libor and index margins of and  respectively 
the term portion of the amended credit facility totaled  and the revolver totaled  interest accrues on the principal amount of the borrowings at a rate based on either libor plus a libor margin or  at the election of the borrower  at an index rate prime based rate plus an index margin 
beginning on september   the applicable margins may be adjusted quarterly on a prospective basis based on a change in specified financial ratios 
the term loan is payable in quarterly installments plus interest beginning june  through march   with a final payment of  payable on april  borrowings under the line are subject to certain financial covenants and restrictions on indebtedness  dividend payments  financial guarantees  annual capital expenditures  and other related items 
the availability of the revolving credit facility is not based on any borrowing base requirements  but borrowings may be limited by certain financial covenants 
the company has provided a security interest in substantially all of the company s us based assets as collateral for the amended credit facility 
at march   the company was in compliance with applicable financial covenants 
as of march   the company utilized the libor based rate for approximately  and the balance utilized the index based rate 
the interest rate applicable to borrowings under the revolving credit facility was approximately at march  as of march   the outstanding borrowings on the revolver  which is classified as long term debt  were  and the company had the right to borrow an additional  under the revolving credit facility 
commitment fees on the unused balance were equal to 
per annum of the average amount of unused balances

at march   of this assumed short term borrowing was outstanding and was included in short term debt in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  and these amounts were paid during additionally  the company had  in short term debt at march   which was refinanced by the revolver during liquidity 
at march   we had approximately  of available cash and  of borrowing capacity under our amended revolving credit facility 
this cash balance includes cash of  in china which is subject to certain restrictions on the transfer to another country because of currency control regulations 
we believe the company s financial position and ability to generate cash will be sufficient to meet funding of day to day and material short and long term commitments for the foreseeable future 
other comprehensive income comprehensive income consists of net income for the period and the impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 
the increase in other comprehensive income from the changes in the exchange rates is primarily due to the changes in the value of the us dollar relative to the euro and rmb 
dividends we have not declared cash dividends on our common equity 
the payment of dividends is prohibited under the amended credit facility 
we may  in the future  declare dividends under certain circumstances 
at present  there are no material restrictions on the ability of our hong kong and european subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends  loans  advances  or purchases of materials  products  or services 
chinese laws and regulations  including currency exchange controls  restrict distribution and repatriation of dividends by our china subsidiary 
seasonality sales of our products are not seasonal 
inflation we compete on the basis of product design  features  and value 
accordingly  our revenues generally have kept pace with inflation  notwithstanding that inflation in the countries where our subsidiaries are located has been consistently higher than inflation in the united states 
increases in labor costs have not had a significant impact on our business because most of our employees are in china  where prevailing labor costs are low 
however  we have experienced some significant increases in materials costs  and as a result  we have suffered a decline in margin 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
aggregate contractual obligations as of march   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows contractual obligations payment due by period thereafter total long term debt obligations interest obligation on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations deferred acquisition payments capital additions china facility total operating lease obligations are not reduced for annual sublease rentals of approximately item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a certain level of foreign currency exchange risk 
most of our revenues are priced in united states dollars 
most of our costs and expenses are priced in united states dollars  with the remaining priced in rmb  euros and hong kong dollars 
accordingly  the competitiveness of our products relative to products produced locally in foreign markets may be affected by the performance of the united states dollar compared with that of our foreign customers currencies 
united states net sales were   and  or   and of net sales  for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
net sales from our foreign facilities were   and  or   and of net sales  for the fiscal years ended march    and  respectively 
we are exposed to foreign currency transaction and translation losses  which might result from adverse fluctuations in the value of the euro  hong kong dollar and rmb 
at march    and we had net assets of   and  respectively  in the united states 
at march    and we had net assets of   and  respectively  in china subject to fluctuations in the value of the rmb against the united states dollar 
at march    and we had net assets of   and  respectively  in hong kong subject to fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar against the united states dollar 
at march    and we had net assets liabilities of   and  respectively  in europe  subject to fluctuations in the value of the euro against the united states dollar 
fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar have not been significant since october   when the hong kong government tied the value of the hong kong dollar to that of the united states dollar 
however  there can be no assurance that the value of the hong kong dollar will continue to be tied to that of the united states dollar 
on july   the rmb increased in value by approximately as compared to the us dollar  and during and  the rmb appreciated by an additional and  respectively 
the chinese government announced that it will no longer peg the rmb to the us dollar  but established a currency policy letting the rmb trade in a narrow band against a basket of currencies 
based on our net exposure of rmb to us dollars for the fiscal year ended march  and forecast information for fiscal  we estimate a negative gross margin income impact of approximately for every appreciation in renminbi against the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and no associated cost increases or currency hedging 
we continue to consider various alternatives to hedge this exposure  and have considered  but do not currently use  foreign currency contracts as a hedging strategy 
we are attempting to manage this exposure through  among other things  pricing and monitoring balance sheet exposures for payables and receivables 
based on the net exposures of euros to the us dollars for the fiscal year ended march   we estimate a positive gross margin impact of for every appreciation in euros relative to the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and associated cost increases or currency hedging 
the company has a number of foreign currency exchange contracts in europe 
these currency contracts have a total notional amount of  with exercise dates through march at an average exchange rate of euro to us dollar conversion rate 
since these derivatives are not designated as cash flow hedges under fasb  changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings  not in other comprehensive income 
as of march  and  the fair value of these contracts was an asset liability of and  respectively 
there can be no assurance that these currencies will remain stable or will fluctuate to our benefit 
to manage our exposure to potential foreign currency  transaction and translation risks  we may purchase currency exchange forward contracts  currency options  or other derivative instruments  provided such instruments may be obtained at suitable prices 
we do have a number of foreign exchange currency contracts in europe  as disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
under our term and revolving credit facilities  we are exposed to a certain level of interest rate risk 
interest on the principal amount of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility accrues at a rate based on either a london inter bank offered rate libor rate plus a libor margin or at an indexed prime based rate plus an index margin 
the libor or index rate is at our election 
our results will be adversely affected by any increase in interest rates 
for example  based on the  of total debt outstanding under these facilities at march   an annual interest rate increase of basis points would increase interest expense and decrease our pre tax profitability by we do not hedge this interest rate exposure
