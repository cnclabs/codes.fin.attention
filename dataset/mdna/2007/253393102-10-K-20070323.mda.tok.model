newly issued accounting standards in june  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  disclosure requirements for taxes assessed by a governmental authority on revenue producing transactions  which provides that entities should present such taxes on either a gross or net basis based on their accounting policies 
the company s accounting policy is to record such taxes on a net basis 
eitf is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december  the implementation of eitf in the first quarter of fiscal will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin is an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  and it seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of measurement and recognition in accounting for income taxes 
in addition  fin requires expanded disclosure with respect to the uncertainty in income taxes and is effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
the cumulative effect  if any  of adopting fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of fiscal the company expects that the financial impact of applying the provisions of fin to all tax positions will not be material upon the initial adoption of fin in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  established a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements  however  sfas does not require any new fair value measurements 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that sfas will have on our financial statements 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
critical accounting policies are those that the company believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require the company s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inventory valuation the company values inventory using the lower of weighted average cost or market method 
market price is generally based on the current selling price of the merchandise 
the company regularly reviews inventories to determine if the carrying value of the inventory exceeds market value and the company records a reserve to reduce the carrying value to its market price  as necessary 
historically  the company has rarely experienced significant occurrences of obsolescence or slow moving inventory 
however  future changes such as customer merchandise preference  unseasonable weather patterns  or business trends could cause the company s inventory to be exposed to obsolescence or slow moving merchandise 
shrink expense is accrued as a percentage of merchandise sales based on historical shrink trends 
the company performs physical inventories at the stores and distribution centers throughout the year 
the reserve for shrink represents an estimate for shrink for each of the company s locations since the last physical inventory date through the reporting date 
estimates by location and in the aggregate are impacted by internal and external factors and may vary significantly from actual results 
vendor allowances vendor allowances include allowances  rebates and cooperative advertising funds received from vendors 
these funds are determined for each fiscal year and the majority are based on various quantitative contract terms 
amounts expected to be received from vendors relating to the purchase of merchandise inventories are recognized as a reduction of cost of goods sold as the merchandise is sold 
amounts that represent a reimbursement of costs incurred  such as advertising  are recorded as a reduction to the related expense in the period that the related expense is incurred 
the company records an estimate of earned allowances based on the latest projected purchase volumes and advertising forecasts 
on an annual basis at the end of the year  the company confirms earned allowances with vendors to ensure the amounts are recorded in accordance with the terms of the contract 
goodwill  intangible assets and impairment of long lived assets goodwill and other finite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis 
our evaluation of goodwill for impairment requires accounting judgments and financial estimates in determining the fair value of the reporting unit 
if these judgments or estimates change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
the company reviews long lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable based on estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
assets are reviewed at the lowest level for which cash flows can be identified  which is the store level 
in determining future cash flows  significant estimates are made by the company with respect to future operating results of each store over its remaining lease term 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
business combinations our acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the assets and liabilities are adjusted to their fair values and the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
the determination of fair value involves the use of an independent appraisal  estimates and assumptions which we believe provided a reasonable basis for determining fair value 
self insurance the company is self insured for certain losses related to health  workers compensation and general liability insurance  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our liability exposure 
liabilities associated with these losses are estimated in part by considering historical claims experience  industry factors  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions 

table of contents stock based compensation the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model which requires the input of assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the estimated volatility of the company s common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
changes in the assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the company s net exposure to interest rate risk will consist primarily of borrowings under the senior secured revolving credit facility 
the company s senior secured revolving credit facility bears interest at rates that are benchmarked either to us short term floating rate interest rates or one month libor rates  at the company s election 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the senior secured revolving credit facility as of february  and january  the impact on the company s annual net income of a hypothetical one percentage point interest rate change on the average outstanding balances under the senior secured revolving credit facility would be approximately million based upon fiscal average borrowings 
credit risk in february  the company sold million issue price of senior unsecured convertible notes due convertible notes 
in conjunction with the issuance of these convertible notes  we also entered into a five year convertible bond hedge and a five year separate warrant transaction with one of the initial purchasers the counterparty and or certain of its affiliates 
subject to the movement in our common stock price  we could be exposed to credit risk arising out of net settlement of the convertible bond hedge and separate warrant transaction in our favor 
based on our review of the possible net settlements and the credit strength of the counterparty and its affiliates  we believe that we do not have a material exposure to credit risk as a result of these share option transactions 
impact of inflation the company does not believe that operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three fiscal years 
there can be no assurance  however  that operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
tax matters presently  the company does not believe that there are any tax matters that could materially affect the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and quarterly results the company s business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
significant portions of the company s net sales and profits are realized during the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal year  which is due  in part  to the holiday selling season and  in part  to our sales of cold weather sporting goods and apparel 
any decrease in fiscal fourth quarter sales  whether because of a slow holiday selling season  unseasonable weather conditions  or otherwise  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results for the entire fiscal year
