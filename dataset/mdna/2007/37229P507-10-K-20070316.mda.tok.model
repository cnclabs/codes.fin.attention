item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k including the disclosures under item a 
risk factors 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the research and development of novel immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer 
immunotherapies are treatments that utilize the immune system to combat diseases 
our lead product candidate  myvax personalized immunotherapy  is a patient specific active immunotherapy that is based on the unique genetic makeup of a patient s tumor and is designed to activate a patient s immune system to identify and attack cancer cells 
myvax is currently in a pivotal phase clinical trial for the treatment of follicular b cell non hodgkin s lymphoma  or b cell nhl and has clinical trials in diffuse large b cell nhl and mantle cell nhl 
b cells  also called b lymphocytes  are one of the two major classes of lymphocytes  which are types of white blood cells 
in the united states  b cell nhl represents approximately to of diagnosed cases of lymphoma 
in the united states  approximately  patients are newly diagnosed with nhl each year  and there are over  existing patients currently diagnosed with nhl 
our pivotal phase clinical trial is designed for the treatment of follicular b cell nhl  which represents approximately of the cases of nhl 
results from our completed and our ongoing clinical trials of myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl indicate that myvax is generally safe and well tolerated 
we believe that patient specific active immunotherapies can also be applied successfully to the treatment of other cancers 
as a result  we initiated a phase clinical trial in february to evaluate myvax for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  or cll 
in november  based on positive interim phase clinical trial results from our trial  we initiated a pivotal  double blind  placebo controlled phase clinical trial  our trial  to assess the safety and efficacy of myvax in treating patients with previously untreated follicular b cell nhl 
the treatment phase for all of the patients enrolled in this trial has been completed 
during the week of july   our independent data safety monitoring board  or dsmb  met and reviewed the second planned interim analysis of blinded data for safety and efficacy in our pivotal phase clinical trial and recommended the trial continue as planned 
we currently anticipate that we will obtain the initial results of the primary analysis  that is whether a statistically significant increase in progression free survival is observed in patients receiving myvax compared to patients receiving the control substance  from our phase clinical trial by the end of  however  it will take several 
table of contents months following the last patient visit  currently planned for november  to complete all the final analyses of the data from our phase clinical trial 
we believe that  if successful  the results of our phase clinical trial will support our application for regulatory approval of myvax for the treatment of follicular b cell nhl 
the total research and development costs associated with and incurred for the development of myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl were approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
from inception through december   the total research and development costs associated with and incurred for the development of myvax for the treatment of follicular b cell nhl were approximately million 
we are also developing a panel of monoclonal antibodies that we believe potentially represents an additional novel  personalized approach for treating nhl 
we recently filed patent applications for the composition and therapeutic use of this panel 
the monoclonal antibodies could eventually be used alone or in synergistic combination with myvax and might reduce or eliminate the need for chemotherapy in the early treatment of nhl 
we intend to file an investigational new drug  or ind  application in the first half of and initiate clinical trials thereafter 
we have not generated any revenues to date  and we have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements of common and preferred stock  our lines of credit  public offerings of common stock and interest income earned from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we are a development stage enterprise and have incurred significant losses since our inception in  as we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development activities  including clinical trials 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  including million that is restricted as to its use 
in february  we completed an underwritten public offering under our shelf registration statement in which we sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
after deducting the underwriters commission and estimated offering expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
we anticipate working on a number of long term development projects that will involve experimental and unproven technology 
the projects may require many years and substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
we will need significant additional operating funds to continue our research and development activities and clinical trials  pursue regulatory approvals  and if regulatory approval of a product candidate is obtained  to build sales and marketing capabilities and potentially expand production capabilities  as necessary 
we cannot predict when we may begin to realize product revenue 
until we are able to generate sufficient product revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies  myvax  or any other immunotherapies that we may develop  or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research and development programs or our commercialization efforts 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and any additional debt financing  if available  may require that we pledge our assets  including our intellectual property  or involve restrictive covenants that would limit our business activities 
the successful development of our drug candidates is highly uncertain 
we cannot estimate with certainty or know the exact nature  timing or cost of the efforts necessary to complete the development of myvax nor can we predict with precision when these development efforts will be completed 
we cannot reasonably predict when we may have material net cash inflows from sales of myvax  if ever 
these uncertainties result from the numerous risks associated with developing myvax  including the possibility of delays in the collection of clinical trial data and the uncertainty of the timing and results of the final analysis of our pivotal phase clinical trial for myvax  
table of contents the uncertainty of obtaining regulatory approval for myvax  including regulatory approval for our manufacturing facility and process  the uncertainty related to completion of the equipping and qualification of our new manufacturing facility  including the purchase and installation of any additional equipment that may be necessary to achieve additional manufacturing capacity for commercialization of myvax  if myvax receives regulatory approval  our ability to manufacture commercial quantities of myvax at acceptable cost levels  and our ability to successfully market and sell myvax 
if we fail to complete the development of myvax in a timely manner  it could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
in addition  any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a further discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our projects on schedule  or at all  and certain consequences of failing to do so are set forth in the risk factors entitled we will need significant additional funding and may be unable to raise capital when needed  which would force us to delay  reduce or eliminate our product development programs or commercialization efforts  we currently have no source of revenue and may never become profitable  we are dependent on the success of our lead product candidate  myvax  and if clinical trials of myvax  or any other immunotherapies that we may develop  do not produce successful clinical trial results  we will be unable to commercialize these products and our efforts to discover  develop and commercialize myvax for indications other than follicular b cell nhl are at an early stage and are subject to a high risk of failure  as well as other risk factors 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our clinical development  apply for regulatory approvals  equip and qualify our manufacturing facility  including the purchase and installation of any additional equipment that may be necessary to achieve additional manufacturing capacity for the commercial scale manufacture of myvax if myvax receives regulatory approval  and seek to develop active immunotherapies for the treatment of cll and potentially other forms of cancer  to establish sales and marketing and distribution capabilities and otherwise to expand our operations 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements clinical trial accruals 
our cost accruals for clinical trials are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended pursuant to contracts with numerous clinical trial centers and clinical research organizations 
these costs are a significant component of research and development expenses 
in the normal course of business  we contract with third parties to perform various clinical trial activities in the ongoing development of myvax 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and variation from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
payments under the contracts depend on factors such as the achievement of certain events  the successful accrual of patients or the completion of portions of the clinical trial or similar conditions 
the objective of our accrual policy is to match the recording of expenses in our financial statements to the actual services received and efforts expended 
we accrue for the costs of clinical studies conducted by contract research organizations  or cros  based on estimated costs over the life of the individual study 
further  we monitor patient registration levels and related activity to the extent possible and adjust our estimates on a monthly basis 
in addition to considering information from our clinical operations group regarding the status of our clinical trials  we rely on information from cros to calculate our accrual for direct clinical expenses at the end of each reporting period 
for indirect expenses  which relate to site and other 
table of contents administrative costs to manage our clinical trials  we rely on information provided by the cro  including costs incurred by the cro as of a particular reporting date  to calculate our indirect clinical expenses 
our estimates and assumptions may not match the timing of actual services performed by the organizations  which may result in adjustments to our research and development expenses in future periods 
stock based compensation 
we have adopted various stock plans that provide for the grant of stock option awards to employees  non employee directors and consultants 
we also have an employee stock purchase plan the espp which enables employees to purchase our common stock 
see note for further information regarding our stock based compensation assumptions and expenses  including pro forma disclosures for prior periods as if we had recorded stock based compensation expense 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the provisions of  and began to account for stock based compensation in accordance with  the financial accounting standards board s fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which replaced statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
we transitioned to sfas r using the modified prospective method  under which prior periods have not been revised for comparative purposes 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new grants and to grants that were outstanding as of the effective date and are subsequently modified 
estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost previously estimated for our sfas pro forma disclosures 
stock based compensation expense recognized during the period is based on the value of the portion of stock based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest during the period 
recognized stock based compensation expense includes compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas for options granted after our initial public offering of our common stock the ipo 
compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december  are based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the estimated fair value of our equity based awards  less expected forfeitures  is amortized over the awards vesting periods on a straight line basis 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and espp shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as by assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
because there is insufficient historical information available to estimate the expected term of the stock based awards  we adopted the simplified method for estimating the expected term pursuant to sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
on this basis  we estimated the expected term of options granted by taking the average of the vesting term and the contractual term of the option 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock by using historical volatility  with an assessment of reasonableness through a review of the volatility of comparable companies 
we base the risk free interest rate that we use in the option valuation model on us treasury zero coupon issues  with remaining terms similar to the expected term on the options 
we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future  and therefore  use an expected dividend yield of zero in the option valuation model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based payment awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 

table of contents if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  amounts recorded in future periods may differ significantly from amounts we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our results of operations 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable  characteristics not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that are significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there currently is no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
any such change may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
the use of a particular option valuation model may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions

recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin are effective as of january   with the cumulative effect  if any  of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin on our financial statements  but do not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  the fasb having previously concluded in those accounting pronouncements that fair value is the relevant measurement attribute 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  for some entities  the application of this statement will change current practice 
the provisions of sfas are effective as of january  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas  but do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 

table of contents the statement provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements to facilitate comparisons between companies using different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
the statement is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  earlier adoption is permitted provided the company also elects to apply the provisions of sfas  fair value measurement 
we are currently evaluating the impact that this standard may have on our financial statements 
results of operations research and development expenses year ended december  annual percent change in millions  except percentages staffing related clinical trial and manufacturing material costs amortization of deferred stock based compensation facilities and other costs total research and development expenses research and development expenses represented approximately  and of our total operating expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses include the personnel costs related to our development activities and clinical trial preparations  preclinical and clinical trial expenses  including costs related to registration  treatment and monitoring expenses  costs related to regulatory matters and costs related to the development of our manufacturing process 
the increase in research and development expenses for as compared to was a result of higher staffing levels and development activity  of which approximately million was related to the hiring of process sciences  research and manufacturing executives and related personnel during in addition  we recognized higher facilities and other costs of approximately million in  which included higher rent expense of approximately million associated with the lease agreements for the new manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters  as well as an increase of approximately million related to information technology costs  an increase of approximately million in depreciation expense  a million increase in utilities expenses and million of other facility costs related to our facilities located in redwood city  fremont and foster city  california 
there was also an increase in non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million related to the adoption of sfas r  which requires the recording of stock option expense 
other increased costs of approximately million were related to increased usage of clinical trial materials and external testing 
the increase in research and development expenses for as compared to was a result of higher staffing levels  of which approximately million was related to the hiring of process sciences  research and manufacturing executives and related personnel during in addition  we recognized higher facilities and other costs of approximately million in  associated with the lease agreements for the new manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters 
these increases were offset partially by decreased costs related to manufacturing materials and external testing of approximately million  resulting from the completion of patient registration in the second quarter of for our pivotal phase clinical trial and a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense of approximately million resulting from the continued vesting of these previously granted options 
we expect to devote substantial resources to research and development in future periods as we continue our development of myvax and expect our research and development expenditures to increase during and subsequent years 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials  including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  adverse side effects among patients  insufficient supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our product candidates 
in 
table of contents addition  the development of our products will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of further development and approval of our products 
sales and marketing expenses year ended december  annual percent change in millions  except percentages staffing related product advocacy costs amortization of deferred stock based compensation facilities and other costs total sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of personnel costs and outside marketing activities related to product support and awareness 
sales and marketing expenses were generally the same in as in  as higher allocated facilities costs and the impact of sfas r related to recording of stock option expense were offset by a million decline in product advocacy costs 
sales and marketing expenses increased for as compared to  primarily due to increased staffing costs of approximately million related to the hiring of additional staff 
facilities and other costs increased by million primarily due to increased rent expense associated with our new facilities 
we expect sales and marketing spending to remain about the same in as  but then to increase in subsequent years as we prepare for the possible commercialization of myvax for the treatment of follicular b cell nhl 
general and administrative expenses year ended december  annual percent change in millions  except percentages staffing related legal  professional fees and insurance amortization of deferred stock based compensation facilities and other costs total general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs of administrative personnel and related costs to support our organizational growth  as well as legal  accounting and other professional fees

general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to  due primarily to higher payroll related costs  legal and professional fees and corporate insurance costs totaling approximately million required to support the organizational growth of the company  and million of increased rent expense associated with our new facilities 

table of contents we expect our general and administrative expenses to remain about the same in as  but then to increase in subsequent years as we prepare for the possible commercialization of myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl and incur additional infrastructure costs associated with our organizational growth  including costs associated with potential implementation of new finance and accounting systems 
interest expense year ended december  annual percent change in thousands  except percentages interest expense interest expense for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively  compared to interest expense of  for the year ended december  the increase in over was primarily due to interest of  recorded for the amortization of the lease finance obligation recorded under eitf interest and other income  net year ended december  annual percent change in millions  except percentages interest and other income  net the increase in interest and other income  net  in as compared to was due to interest received on higher average cash balances as a result of proceeds received from our public offering in february  as well as higher interest rates during the increase in interest and other income  net  in as compared to was due to interest received on higher average cash balances as a result of proceeds received from our follow on offering in june and our private placement in december  as well as higher interest rates during liquidity and capital resources as of december  in millions cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities inclusive of million and million on december  and december  respectively  which is restricted as to its use year ended december  cash flows net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million  including million  that is restricted as to its use  compared to million as of december  and million as of december  we have two outstanding letters of credit related to the construction of our new manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters that  as of december   were collateralized by million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held in one of our investment accounts and classified as a restricted  noncurrent asset on our balance sheet 
as we have proceeded with the build out and the payment of the construction costs  these collateralized assets have decreased in proportion to the payments made 
in addition  we have a million certificate of deposit that serves as collateral for two other letters of credit related to 
table of contents the lease of our new facilities 
both the investment account and the certificate of deposit have been classified as restricted cash and marketable securities on our balance sheet 
we have not generated any revenues to date  and we have financed our operations and internal growth through private placements of common and preferred stock  our lines of credit  our completed public offerings of common stock  and interest income earned from our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception in and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our accumulated deficit resulted principally from our research and development activities associated with myvax  including our pivotal phase clinical trial and additional phase clinical trials  and several non cash charges associated with our preferred stock financings 
included in our accumulated deficit is a non cash dividend of approximately million related to our preferred stock financings in april and may also  our accumulated deficit includes a non cash charge of approximately million associated with the extinguishment of convertible notes and cancellation of the related warrants issued to preferred stockholders in august and approximately million of non cash interest expense related to the amortization of the discount on the convertible notes 
additionally  there was non cash interest expense of approximately million associated with the amortization of the warrant issued to the guarantor of our lines of credit 
through december   we had amortized and expensed non cash stock based compensation of approximately million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increased use of cash in operations for compared to was primarily due to million of research and development activities associated with myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl excluding deferred stock compensation charges  which are non cash  and an unfavorable cash flow impact of million due to the reduction in accounts payable resulting from lower year end activity and the timing of payments to vendors excluding capital spending 
the increased use of cash in operations for compared to was primarily due to our continued research and development activities associated with myvax for the treatment of b cell nhl and higher cash usage for prepaids and other assets  primarily related to million of prepaid rent and million of new facility construction costs paid by the company that have not yet been reimbursed by the landlord 
these increased uses of cash were offset in part by a million increase in accounts payable attributable to the timing of vendor payments

the facility was completed in the fourth quarter of  although we are continuing to equip and qualify the facility 
the current estimated cost of the build out is approximately million 
as part of the construction agreements  the landlord has provided a tenant improvement allowance of approximately million  which is being applied towards the construction of the two buildings 
the facility is designed for the production of myvax for  patients each year and  if myvax receives regulatory approval  we would need to purchase and install additional equipment in our facility to achieve this level of manufacturing capacity

during the year ended december   we completed the sale  in a registered underwritten public offering pursuant to our effective shelf registration statement  of  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share for aggregate gross proceeds of million 
after deducting the underwriters commission and offering expenses  we received net proceeds of approximately million 
during the year ended december   we also received proceeds of approximately million from borrowings against a line of credit from the general electric capital corporation gecc for the purchase of computer  laboratory and manufacturing equipment 
cash used in financing activities during included a million cash security deposit paid to gecc related to the line of credit obtained in the fourth quarter

these proceeds were offset partially by payments of million related to offering costs from our initial public offering 
as of december   we had contractual and other debt obligations as follows in thousands payments due by period less than beyond total year years years years contractual obligations non cancelable lease financing obligations  including interest  related to new building lease agreements credit line payment obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations related to other facilities total contractual obligations in may  we entered into two lease agreements to lease an aggregate of approximately  square feet of space located in two buildings at the ardenwood technology park in fremont  california for our new manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters the lease agreements 
the term of each of the leases is years and each lease will terminate in november the lease agreements include two five year options to extend the terms of the leases 
in addition  we have a three year option to lease additional space on adjacent property 

table of contents in december  we entered into a letter of credit and reimbursement agreement the reimbursement agreement and related security agreement security agreement with a commercial bank that provides for the issuance of four letters of credit  described below as the rent letters of credit and the construction letters of credit 
these letters of credit were provided to secure certain rental and construction obligations under the lease and construction agreements for our new manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters 
contemporaneously with the execution of the lease agreements  we also entered into two construction agreements to provide for the build out of the two building campus 
as part of the construction agreements  the landlord has provided us a tenant improvement allowance of approximately million to be applied towards the construction of the two buildings 
prior to the commencement of construction  we were required under the construction agreements to provide an irrevocable unconditional letter of credit equal to the difference between the total estimated construction costs and the improvement allowance  which difference was estimated to be approximately million 
as of december   two letters of credit had been provided to the landlord in the aggregate amount of million the construction letters of credit that were issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of the reimbursement agreement 
as of december   the aggregate amount of the two construction letters of credit has been decreased to million to reflect the build out and our payment of construction costs 
the construction letters of credit will expire on may  pursuant to the terms of the security agreement  the construction letters of credit are being collateralized by cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held in our bank investment account totaling approximately million as of december  as we proceed with equipping and efforts to qualify the facility and the payment of the construction costs  the collateralized assets and restricted cash will continue to decrease in proportion to the payments made 
the lease agreements provided for rent holidays for the first five and one half months  which were expensed as incurred  and an initial monthly basic rent of per square foot  with scheduled annual rent increases of over the lease term 
we are responsible for approximately of the construction costs for the tenant improvements and  under eitf no 
 the effect of lessee involvement in asset construction  the company is deemed  for accounting purposes only  to be the accounting owner of the project and the building shells  even though it is not the legal owner 
upon the commencement of the leases in may  we capitalized the estimated fair value of the building shells of million  which has been recorded as a fixed asset 
the related liability has been recorded as a lease financing liability on the accompanying balance sheet 
in accordance with eitf  the portion of the leases related to ground rent will be treated as an operating lease expense 
because we are considered the owner for accounting purposes  build out costs reimbursed by the landlord will increase the lease financing liability 
build out costs paid by us will be capitalized consistent with our standard policy 
upon occupancy in the fourth quarter of  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  we began to amortize the lease financing liability over the lease term based upon the payments designated in the agreement  and the building and improvement assets will be depreciated on a straight line basis over their useful lives 
the lease agreements required us to provide a million security deposit  of which million was in the form of cash and million was in the form of a letter of credit 
in september  we paid a cash security deposit to the landlord of million and as of december   we have provided two letters of credit to the landlord in the aggregate amount of million the rent letters of credit 
the rent letters of credit were issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of the reimbursement agreement and will expire on january  pursuant to the terms of the security agreement  the rent letters of credit are collateralized in the same amount by a certificate of deposit held in our bank account and recorded as restricted cash see note of notes to financial statements

table of contents financial condition 
if an event of default occurs and is continuing  the bank may cause all amounts outstanding under the reimbursement agreement at that time to become immediately due and payable 
our commitments under operating leases related to our other facilities consist of payments relating to one real estate sublease 
on march   we entered into a sublease with argonaut technologies  inc to lease  square feet of laboratory and office space in redwood city  california 
this sublease expired in february of  with lease payments of approximately  that were paid after december  we anticipate working on a number of long term development projects that will involve experimental and unproven technology 
these projects may require many years and substantial expenditures to complete and may ultimately be unsuccessful 
we will need significant additional operating funds to continue our research and development activities and clinical trials  pursue regulatory approvals and  if regulatory approval of any product candidate is obtained  to build sales and marketing capabilities and potentially expand production capabilities  as necessary 
we believe that our current cash resources will provide us with sufficient financial resources to support our operating plan through at least the end of  which includes the anticipated timing of the completion of our phase clinical trial in november our estimate of the period of time through which our financial resources will be adequate to support our operations is a forward looking statement and involves risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary significantly as a result of a number of factors  including the risk factors discussed in this annual report on form k 
we have based this estimate on current assumptions that may prove to be wrong  and we could utilize our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect 
we expect that our cash consumption will decrease in the buildings for our manufacturing facility and corporate headquarters were placed into service during the third and fourth quarters of  although we continue to purchase related manufacturing and laboratory equipment to fully equip the facility 
we have incurred approximately million through december  related to construction  design and other activities in connection with our facility and headquarters  excluding the non cash impact of the million recorded under eitf the current estimated cost of the build out is approximately million 
as part of the construction agreements  the landlord has provided a tenant improvement allowance of approximately million which is being applied towards the construction of the two buildings 
we will need to raise significant additional funds to commercialize myvax if myvax receives regulatory approval for the treatment of follicular b cell nhl 
for example  our manufacturing facility is designed for the production of myvax for  or more patients each year and  if myvax receives regulatory approval  our facility would require us to purchase and install additional equipment to achieve this level of manufacturing capacity 
our manufacturing facility must pass a pre approval inspection from the appropriate regulatory agency prior to any regulatory approval for myvax 
we cannot predict when we may begin to realize product revenue 
until we can generate sufficient product revenue  if ever  we expect to finance future cash needs through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  corporate collaboration or licensing arrangements or other arrangements  as well as through interest income earned on cash balances 
we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our stockholders may experience dilution  and any debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
to the extent that we raise additional funds through collaboration and licensing arrangements  it may be necessary to relinquish some rights to our technologies  myvax or any other immunotherapies that we may develop  or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs or our commercialization efforts 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders and any additional debt financing  if available  may require that we pledge our assets  including our intellectual property  or involve restrictive covenants that would limit our business activities 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily through our marketable securities 
the primary objective of our cash investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our invested cash without significantly increasing risk of loss 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and investments policy emphasizes liquidity and preservation of principal over yield considerations 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities were million  including restricted cash of million 
due to the nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december   the decline in the total fair value of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities would not be material 
in addition  we do not have any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations as we operate primarily in the united states 
general electric capital corporation agreed to extend to us a line of credit 
the draws against the line of credit are structured as promissory notes with the interest rate fixed at the time of each draw
