item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview fiscal financial results in fiscal  our net revenues increased to  from  in fiscal  with positive growth in all brands 
despite this increase  we were negatively impacted in the back half of the year by the significant softening in the home centered macro economic environment 
as a result  we saw lower direct to customer response rates  weaker retail traffic and an unusually high level of competitive markdown pressure 
this was particularly true in pottery barn  our largest brand  where revenues fell substantially short of our expectations 
there were also specific operational issues within the pottery barn brand  primarily in the areas of merchandising  marketing and retail execution 
a comprehensive recovery plan is underway and we expect that we will see improvement throughout and diluted earnings per share decreased by to in fiscal from in fiscal this decrease included a charge of per diluted share in fiscal related to both the expense associated with the implementation of sfas no 
r  share based payments and fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  and a net benefit from the following unusual business events unredeemed gift certificate income due to a change in estimate  the visa mastercard litigation settlement income  expense associated with the hold everything transition and expense associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer unusual business events 
from a cash flow perspective  fiscal was another strong year  generating  in net cash from operating activities  despite higher inventories and lower growth rates 
in  we returned nearly  to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and dividends  and we ended the year with a cash balance of  after internally funding all growth and infrastructure initiatives  including  in capital expenditures 
in our retail channel  net revenues in fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal  primarily due to an increase in store leased square footage of including net new stores and comparable store sales growth of 
net revenues generated in the west elm  williams sonoma  pottery barn kids  williams sonoma home and the pottery barn brands were the primary contributors to the year over year revenue increase  partially offset by lost revenues in the hold everything brand due to the closure of all its stores in late and the first quarter of in our direct to customer channel  net revenues in fiscal increased by  or  over fiscal this increase was primarily driven by net revenues generated in the pottery barn kids  pottery barn  pbteen  williams sonoma and west elm brands due to an overall increase in catalog page circulation of and continued strength in our internet business  which continued to be our fastest growing shopping channel  with revenues increasing to  this increase was partially offset by lost revenues in the hold everything brand due to its shutdown during the second quarter of fiscal and a reduction in year over year revenues in the williams sonoma home brand 
in our core brands  net revenues increased  including an increase in the pottery barn kids brand  a increase in the williams sonoma brand and a increase in the pottery barn brand 
in its th year of operations  the williams sonoma brand reached a new milestone in profitability and  for the second consecutive year  delivered the highest operating contribution as a percentage of net revenues in its history 
in our emerging brands  including west elm  pbteen and williams sonoma home  revenues increased 
this increase was primarily driven by incremental revenues from the opening of new stores in west elm and williams sonoma home and strong direct to customer growth in pbteen and west elm 
in west elm  incremental revenues from both existing and new stores  improved catalog response  and increased traffic in e commerce drove year over year revenue growth 
we opened stores in fiscal  with two new stores opening during the fourth quarter  bringing our total store count to with an average square footage of approximately  square feet 
in addition  we improved our level of profitability as we made progress on our initiatives to increase catalog productivity through higher response rates and average order sizes 

table of contents in pbteen  increased revenues were driven by revitalized catalog marketing and innovative product introductions  both of which are long term success factors for the brand 
in williams sonoma home  fiscal was a challenging year  particularly since it was the first year the brand began operating in all three shopping channels retail  catalog  and e commerce 
during the year  the reach of the brand was extended by opening four new stores and launching an e commerce website 
despite these growth initiatives  results for the year fell well below our expectations 
these results were impacted by brand building operational issues that are taking longer to implement than initially planned  in addition to the asset impairment charges recorded on two stores during fiscal due to expected future cash flows falling below the current net book value of the stores 
both of these were mid market stores that were opened in fiscal in january  we decided to transition the merchandising strategies of our hold everything brand into our other existing brands by the end of fiscal in connection with this transition  we incurred pre tax charges of approximately  per diluted share and  per diluted share in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
these costs primarily included the initial asset impairment and lease termination costs associated with the shutdown of the hold everything retail stores  the asset impairment of the e commerce website and the write down of impaired merchandise inventories 
in fiscal  this pre tax charge consisted of approximately  in cost of goods sold and approximately  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
all of our hold everything retail stores were closed during late and the first quarter of fiscal the final phase of our operational shutdown was completed in the second quarter of fiscal  with our final hold everything catalog mailed in may and our hold everything website ceasing operations in june fiscal operational results in supply chain operations  we successfully in sourced our east coast furniture hub operations  which allowed us to improve the furniture delivery experience for our customers and reduce our furniture return rates 
we also implemented regional warehousing for our high volume east coast stores  expanded our capabilities in monogramming and personalization  re engineered our direct to customer returns processing operations and expanded our distribution network by increasing distribution leased square footage by 
in information technology  we implemented new retail inventory management systems in our williams sonoma and pottery barn kids brands 
we believe that over time these new systems will allow us to optimize the flow of inventory from our vendors to our stores  as well as improve our service levels to our customers 
we also implemented new gift card issuance and redemption functionality in our direct to customer channel 
we believe that this functionality is critical to driving future growth as consumers increasingly show a preference for this convenient form of gift giving 
to support the long term scalability of our infrastructure  we also continued to invest in the custom development of our new direct to customer order management and inventory management systems 
all of these initiatives enhanced our operational infrastructure and leave us well positioned to support accelerated growth in the coming years 
fiscal in fiscal  we will focus on the strategic initiatives that can transform the financial performance of the company over the next several years driving sustainable revenue growth with a key focus on the revitalization of the pottery barn brand  increasing our pre tax operating margin by continuing to drive operational advancements and cost containment initiatives across the company  and enhancing shareholder value 
to drive sustainable revenue growth in fiscal  we expect to add net new stores and expand or remodel an additional stores 
we also expect to increase catalog circulation and electronic direct marketing and plan to intensify the marketing support behind our fastest growing shopping channel  e commerce 
as a result of our initiatives in the emerging brands west elm  pbteen and williams sonoma home in fiscal  we expect these brands to represent a more significant portion of our growth than in prior years 
in west elm  we will round out our merchandise assortment in core categories and expand to every room of the home 
we will also open five 
table of contents new stores including our largest downtown location which will be in washington dc  increase circulation and page count to support growth  implement initiatives to improve e commerce conversion and test our value proposition within shipping costs 
in pbteen  we will continue to capture marketing opportunities that appeal to families with teens by focusing on the following initiatives building brand awareness through innovative marketing  expanding our assortment  driving key categories through product innovation  refining our contact strategy to optimize response rates  improving our in stock position to increase order fulfillment rates and testing new product categories that hold sizable potential 
in williams sonoma home  our top priority in fiscal is superior execution  from product design to world class furniture delivery 
we are modifying our brand rollout strategy to coincide with the further development of the infrastructure necessary to accelerate the business  therefore  in fiscal  we plan to open two additional stores in dallas  texas and st 
louis  missouri and reduce catalog circulation until such time as we can improve the overall productivity of the direct to customer business 
to improve our overall cost structure  we will continue to drive efficiencies within our supply chain  leverage our emerging brand infrastructure and maintain tight controls around overhead expenses while investing in our future 
we expect  however  that we will see further short term compression in our operating margin in fiscal as a result of continued softness in the home furnishings macro economic environment  increased costs associated with the pottery barn recovery plan and higher incentive compensation 
to enhance shareholder value  we will continue to adhere to the principles that have successfully guided us in the past building the authority of our existing brands in the market segments that we serve  and continuing to leverage the potential of our multi channel strategy 
we are also increasing our quarterly dividend by  from per common share to per common share  in addition to continuing our ongoing share repurchase program 
as we enter fiscal  we are authorized to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock

by measuring the year over year sales of merchandise in the stores that have a history of being open for a full comparable months or more  we can better gauge how the core store base is performing since it excludes new store openings  store remodelings  expansions and closings 
comparable stores exclude new retail concepts until such time as we believe that comparable store results in those concepts are meaningful to evaluating the performance of the retail strategy

among other things  weather conditions can affect comparable store sales because inclement weather can alter consumer behavior or require us to close certain stores temporarily and thus reduce store traffic 
even if stores are not closed  many customers may decide to avoid going to stores in bad weather 
these factors have caused our comparable store sales to fluctuate significantly in the past on an annual  quarterly and monthly basis and  as a result  we expect that comparable store sales will continue to fluctuate in the future

certain leases contain renewal options for periods up to years 
the rental payment requirements in our store leases are typically structured as either minimum rent  minimum rent plus additional rent based on a percentage of store sales if a specified store sales threshold is exceeded  or rent based on a percentage of store sales if a specified store sales threshold or contractual obligations of the landlord has not been met 
contingent rental payments  including rental payments that are based on a percentage of sales  cannot be predicted with certainty at the onset of the lease term 
accordingly  any contingent rental payments are recorded as incurred each period when the sales threshold is probable and are excluded from our calculation of deferred rent liability

we are party to a variety of contractual agreements under which we may be obligated to indemnify the other party for certain matters 
these contracts primarily relate to our commercial contracts  operating leases  trademarks  intellectual property  financial agreements and various other agreements 
under these contracts  we may provide certain routine indemnifications relating to representations and warranties or personal injury matters 
the terms of these indemnifications range in duration and may not be explicitly defined 
historically  we have not made significant payments for these indemnifications 
we believe that if we were to incur a loss in any of these matters  the loss would not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
consolidation of memphis based distribution facilities our memphis based distribution facilities include an operating lease entered into in july for a distribution facility in memphis  tennessee 
the lessor is a general partnership partnership comprised of w 
howard lester  our chairman of the board of directors and chief executive officer and james a 
mcmahan  a director emeritus  both of whom are significant shareholders 
partnership does not have operations separate from the leasing of this distribution facility and does not have lease agreements with any unrelated third parties 
partnership financed the construction of this distribution facility through the sale of a total of  of industrial development bonds in and annual principal payments and monthly interest payments are required through maturity in december the partnership industrial development bonds are collateralized by the distribution facility and the individual partners guarantee the bond repayments 
as of january    was outstanding under the partnership industrial development bonds 
during fiscal  we made annual rental payments of approximately  plus interest on the bonds calculated at a variable rate determined monthly approximately in january  applicable taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses 
although the current term of the lease expires in august  we are obligated to renew the operating lease on an annual basis until these bonds are fully repaid 
our other memphis based distribution facility includes an operating lease entered into in august for another distribution facility that is adjoined to the partnership facility in memphis  tennessee 
the lessor is a general partnership partnership comprised of w 
howard lester  james a 
mcmahan and two unrelated parties 
partnership does not have operations separate from the leasing of this distribution facility and does not have lease agreements with any unrelated third parties 
partnership financed the construction of this distribution facility and related addition through the sale of a total of  of industrial development bonds in and quarterly interest and annual principal payments are required through maturity in august the partnership industrial development bonds are collateralized by the distribution facility and require us to maintain certain financial covenants 
as of january    was outstanding under the partnership industrial development bonds 
during fiscal  we made annual rental payments of approximately  plus applicable taxes  insurance and maintenance expenses 
although the current term of the lease expires in august  we are obligated to renew the operating lease on an annual basis until these bonds are fully repaid 
the two partnerships described above qualify as variable interest entities under fin r due to their related party relationship and our obligation to renew the leases until the bonds are fully repaid 
accordingly  the two related party variable interest entity partnerships from which we lease our memphis based distribution facilities are consolidated by us 
as of january   the consolidation resulted in increases to our consolidated balance sheet of  in assets primarily buildings   in debt and  in other long term liabilities 
consolidation of these partnerships does not have an impact on our net income 

table of contents impact of inflation the impact of inflation on our results of operations for the past three fiscal years has not been significant 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise inventories merchandise inventories  net of an allowance for excess quantities and obsolescence  are stated at the lower of cost weighted average method or market 
we estimate a provision for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory based on inventory aging reports and specific identification 
we generally reserve  based on inventory aging reports  for of the cost of all inventory between one and two years old and of the cost of all inventory over two years old 
if actual obsolescence is different from our estimate  we will adjust our provision accordingly 
specific reserves are also recorded in the event the cost of the inventory exceeds the fair market value 
in addition  on a monthly basis  we estimate a reserve for expected shrinkage at the concept and channel level based on historical shrinkage factors and our current inventory levels 
actual shrinkage is recorded at year end based on the results of our physical inventory count and can vary from our estimates due to such factors as changes in operations within our distribution centers  the mix of our inventory which ranges from large furniture to small tabletop items and execution against loss prevention initiatives in our stores  off site storage locations  and our third party transportation providers 
advertising and prepaid catalog expenses advertising expenses consist of media and production costs related to catalog mailings  e commerce advertising and other direct marketing activities 
all advertising costs are expensed as incurred with the exception of prepaid catalog expenses 
prepaid catalog expenses consist primarily of third party incremental direct costs  including creative design  paper  printing  postage and mailing costs for all of our direct response catalogs 
such costs are capitalized as prepaid catalog expenses and are amortized over their expected period of future benefit 
such amortization is based upon the ratio of actual revenues to the total of actual and estimated future revenues on an individual catalog basis 
estimated future revenues are based upon various factors such as the total number of catalogs and pages circulated  the probability and magnitude of consumer response and the assortment of merchandise offered 
each catalog is generally fully amortized over a six to nine month period  with the majority of the amortization occurring within the first four to five months 
prepaid catalog expenses are evaluated for realizability on a monthly basis by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to the estimated probable remaining future profitability remaining net revenues less merchandise cost of goods sold  selling expenses and catalog related costs associated with that catalog 
if the catalog is not expected to be profitable  the carrying amount of the catalog is impaired accordingly 
property and equipment property and equipment is stated at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
any reduction in the estimated lives would result in higher depreciation expense in a given period for the related assets 
for any store closures where a lease obligation still exists  we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
however  most store closures occur upon the lease expiration 

table of contents we review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review for impairment all stores for which current cash flows from operations are either negative or nominal  or the construction costs are significantly in excess of the amount originally expected 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term typically to years is based upon our experience  historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability and economic conditions 
the future estimates of store profitability and economic conditions require estimating such factors as sales growth  employment rates  lease escalations  inflation on operating expenses and the overall economics of the retail industry for up to years in the future  and are therefore subject to variability and difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the net carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the fair value is estimated based upon future cash flows discounted at a rate that approximates our weighted average cost of capital or other reasonable estimates of fair market value 
see note a to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding property and equipment 
self insured liabilities we are primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and product and general liability claims 
we record self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly 
we determine our workers compensation liability and general liability claims reserves based on an actuarial analysis 
reserves for self insurance liabilities are recorded within accrued salaries  benefits and other on our consolidated balance sheet 
customer deposits customer deposits are primarily comprised of unredeemed gift certificates and merchandise credits and deferred revenue related to undelivered merchandise 
we maintain a liability for unredeemed gift certificates and merchandise credits until the earlier of redemption  escheatment or four years 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed an analysis of our historical gift certificate and gift card redemption patterns  which included an independent actuarial study based on our historical redemption data 
as a result of this analysis  we concluded that the likelihood of our gift certificates and gift cards being redeemed beyond four years from the date of issuance is remote 
as a result  we changed our estimate of the elapsed time for recording income associated with unredeemed gift certificates and gift cards to four years from our prior estimate of seven years 
revenue recognition we recognize revenues and the related cost of goods sold including shipping costs at the time the products are received by our customers in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenue is recognized for retail sales excluding home delivered merchandise at the point of sale in the store and for home delivered merchandise and direct to customer sales when the merchandise is delivered to the customers 
discounts provided to customers are accounted for as a reduction of sales 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns in each reporting period 
shipping and handling fees charged to the customer are recognized as revenue at the time the products are delivered to the customer 
revenues are presented net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
sales return reserve our customers may return purchased items for an exchange or refund 
we record a reserve for estimated product returns  net of cost of goods sold  based on historical return trends together with current product sales performance 
if actual returns  net of cost of goods sold  are different than those projected by management  the estimated sales return reserve will be adjusted accordingly 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements 
we record reserves for estimates of probable settlements of foreign and domestic tax audits 
at any one time  many tax years are subject to audit by various taxing jurisdictions 
the results of these audits and negotiations with taxing authorities may affect the ultimate settlement of these issues 
our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be materially impacted by changes in the mix and level of earnings 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payments  which required us to measure and record compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements for all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method 
for stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights option awards  fair value is determined using the black scholes valuation model  while restricted stock units are valued using the closing price of our stock on the date prior to the date of issuance 
significant factors affecting the fair value of option awards include the estimated future volatility of our stock price and the estimated expected term until the option award is exercised 
the fair value of the award is amortized over the expected service period 
prior to fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation arrangements using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized prior to fiscal for option awards with an exercise price equal to the fair value on the date of grant 
see note i to our consolidated financial statements 
new accounting pronouncements on january   we adopted fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  which requires us to expense all rental costs associated with our operating leases that are incurred during a construction period 
the adoption of this staff position resulted in after tax occupancy expense of approximately  or per diluted share  in fiscal and is recorded as a component of cost of goods sold 
in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  transition and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
we will adopt the provisions of fin beginning in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently in the process of determining the effect the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the scope of eitf includes sales  use  value added and some excise taxes that are assessed by a governmental authority on specific revenue producing transactions between a seller and customer 
eitf requires disclosure of the method of accounting for the applicable assessed taxes and the amount of assessed taxes that are included in revenues if they are accounted for under the gross method 
eitf is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december  we present revenues net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
as of january   we adopted the evaluation requirements of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides the staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements  such as assessing both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements on the current year financial statements 
the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows in fiscal 
table of contents in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures  which establishes a single authoritative definition of fair value  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
only applies to fair value measurements that are already required or permitted by other accounting standards  except for measurements of share based payments  and measurements that are similar to  but not intended to be  fair value 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and will require additional disclosures in our financial statements 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the interest payable on our credit facility  mississippi industrial development bond and the bond related debt associated with our memphis based distribution facilities is based on variable interest rates and is therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt rose basis points an approximate increase in the associated variable rates as of january   our results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in addition  we have fixed and variable income investments consisting of short term investments classified as cash and cash equivalents  which are also affected by changes in market interest rates 
an increase in interest rates of would have an immaterial effect on the value of these investments 
declines in interest rates would  however  decrease the income derived from these investments 
foreign currency risks we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the us in transactions that are denominated in us dollars 
approximately of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
any currency risks related to these transactions were not significant to us during fiscal or fiscal a decline in the relative value of the us dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased purchasing costs 
as of january   we have retail stores in canada  which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
as necessary  we may enter into day foreign currency contracts to minimize any currency remeasurement risk associated with intercompany assets and liabilities of our canadian subsidiary 
these contracts are accounted for by adjusting the carrying amount of the contract to market and recognizing any gain or loss in selling  general and administrative expenses in each reporting period 
we did not enter into any foreign currency contracts during fiscal or fiscal any gain or loss associated with these types of contracts in prior years was not material to us
