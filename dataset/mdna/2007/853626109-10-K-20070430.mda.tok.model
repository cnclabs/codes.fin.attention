item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for further discussion 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
although the company s management has concluded that its system of internal controls over financial reporting was effective as of february   there can be no assurance that the company or its independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in the system of internal controls over financial reporting in the future 
a material weakness in the company s system of internal controls over financial reporting would require management and the company s independent registered public accounting firm to evaluate the company s system of internal controls as ineffective 
this in turn could lead to a loss of public confidence  which could adversely affect the company s business and the price of its common stock 
corporate governance in recent years  the nasdaq global select market  on which the company s common stock is listed  has adopted comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance 
these laws  rules and regulations have increased  and may continue to increase  the scope  complexity and cost of the company s corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices 
failure to comply with these rules and 
table of contents regulations could adversely affect the company  and in a worst case  result in the delisting of its stock 
as a result of these rules  the company s board members  chief executive officer  chief financial officer and other corporate officers could also face increased risks of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  the company may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and officers  which would adversely affect its business 
further  these developments could affect the company s ability to secure desired levels of directors and officers liability insurance  requiring the company to accept reduced insurance coverage or to incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
changes in accounting for equity compensation the company has historically used stock options and sars as a key component of employee compensation in order to align employees interests with the interests of its stockholders  encourage employee retention  and provide competitive compensation packages 
the financial accounting standards board fasb recently adopted changes to generally accepted accounting principles known as statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment revised sfas r requiring a charge to earnings for employee stock option grants and other equity incentives which became effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal to the extent that this or other new regulations make it more difficult or expensive to grant options to employees  the company may consider changes to its equity compensation strategy 
to the extent that such changes might limit the company s use of equity based compensation  it might become more difficult to attract  retain and motivate employees 
any of these results could materially and adversely affect the company s business 
environmental regulation environmental regulations and standards are established worldwide to control discharges  emissions  and solid wastes from manufacturing processes 
within the united states  federal  state and local agencies establish these regulations 
outside of the united states  individual countries and local governments establish their own individual standards 
the company believes that its activities conform to present environmental regulations and historically the effects of this compliance have not had a material effect on the company s capital expenditures  operating results  or competitive position 
future environmental compliance requirements  as well as amendments to or the adoption of new environmental regulations or the occurrence of an unforeseen circumstance could subject the company to fines or require the company to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur other expenses to comply with environmental regulations

item properties smsc s headquarters facility is located in hauppauge  new york  where it owns a  square foot building and conducts research  development  product testing  warehousing  shipping  marketing  selling and administrative activities 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company completed the expansion of its owned hauppauge  new york facility  previously comprising  square feet  to approximately  square feet the entirety of that facility 
during fiscal  the company leased a separate  square foot facility located in hauppauge  new york until may   shortly after the owned facility was completed and operations were consolidated

the company currently expects to renew all existing leases expiring in fiscal  however  it is not certain whether the company will negotiate new leases on its other facilities as such leases expire 
such determinations will be made as existing leases approach expiration and will be based on an assessment of requirements and market conditions at that time 
further  management believes that additional space can be obtained  if necessary  based on prior experience and current and expected real estate market conditions 
item legal proceedings from time to time as a normal consequence of doing business  various claims and litigation may be asserted or commenced against the company 
in particular  the company in the ordinary course of business may receive claims that its products infringe the intellectual property of third parties  or that customers have suffered damage as a result of defective products allegedly supplied by the company 
due to uncertainties inherent in litigation and other claims  the company can give no assurance that it will prevail in any such matters  which could subject the company to significant liability for damages and or invalidate its proprietary rights 
any lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management s time and attention  and an adverse outcome of any significant matter could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated results of operations or cash flows in the quarter or annual period in which one or more of these matters are resolved 
the company believes that at this time there is no pending or threatened litigation that is likely to have a material adverse effect on the company

description of business standard microsystems corporation the company or smsc designs and sells a wide variety of silicon based integrated circuits that incorporate digital or analog signal processing technologies  or both referred to as mixed signal 
the company s integrated circuits and systems provide a wide variety of signal processing attributes that are incorporated by its globally diverse customers into a wide variety of end products in the consumer electronics infotainment  the mobile desktop pc  and industrial other markets 
these semiconductor products generally provide connectivity  networking  or input output control solutions for a variety of high speed communication  computer and related peripheral  consumer electronic device  industrial control system  or auto infotainment applications 
the market for these solutions is increasingly diverse  and the company s various technologies are increasingly used in various combinations and in alternative applications 
critical accounting policies estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of sales and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
smsc believes the following critical accounting policies and estimates are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and require critical management judgments and estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
although management believes that its judgments and estimates are appropriate and reasonable  actual future results may differ from these estimates  and to the extent that such differences are material  future reported operating results may be affected 
revenue recognition sales and revenues and associated gross profit from shipments to the company s distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are deferred until the distributors resell the products 
shipments to distributors  other than to distributors in japan  are made under agreements allowing price protection and limited rights to return unsold merchandise 
in addition  smsc s shipments to its distributors may be subject from time to time to short term fluctuations as distributors manage their inventories to current levels of end user demand 
therefore  smsc considers the policy of deferring revenue on shipments to distributors to be a more meaningful presentation of the company s operating results  as it allows investors to better understand end user demand for the products that smsc sells through distribution channels  and it better focuses the company on end user demand 
this policy is a common practice within the semiconductor industry 
the company s revenue recognition is therefore highly dependent upon receiving pertinent  accurate and timely data from its distributors 
distributors routinely provide the company with product  price  quantity and end customer data when products are resold  as well as report the quantities of the company s products that are still in their inventories 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  the company uses this data and applies judgment in reconciling any differences between the distributors reported inventories and shipment activities 
although this information is reviewed and verified for accuracy  any errors or omissions made by the company s distributors and not detected by the company  if material  could affect reported operating results 
shipments made by the company s japanese subsidiary to distributors in japan are made under agreements that permit limited or no stock return or price protection privileges 
smsc recognizes revenue from product sales to distributors in japan  and to original equipment manufacturers oems  at the time of shipment  net of appropriate reserves for product returns and allowances 
for these revenues  the company must make assumptions and estimates of future product returns and sales allowances  and any differences between those estimates and actual results  if material  could affect reported operating results 

table of contents inventories the company s inventories are comprised of complex  high technology products that may be subject to rapid technological obsolescence and which are sold in a highly competitive industry 
inventories are valued at the lower of first in  first out cost or market  and are reviewed for product obsolescence and impairment in value  based upon assumptions of future demand and market conditions 
the company often receives orders from customers and distributors requesting delivery of product on relatively short notice and with lead times that are shorter than the manufacturing cycle time 
in order to provide competitive delivery times to its customers  the company builds and stocks a certain amount of inventory in anticipation of customer demand that may or may not materialize 
historically  forecasts of customer demand  particularly at a part number level  are challenging and can vary significantly from actual future demand 
in addition  as is common in the semiconductor industry  customers may be allowed to cancel orders with minimal advance notice 
these dynamics create risks that the company may forecast incorrectly and consequently produce excess or insufficient inventories 
when it is determined that specific inventory is stated at a higher value than that which can be recovered  the company writes this inventory down to its estimated realizable value with a charge to costs of goods sold 
while the company endeavors to appropriately forecast customer demand and stock commensurate levels of inventory  unanticipated inventory write downs may be required in future periods relating to inventory on hand as of any reported balance sheet 
stock based compensation the company has several stock based compensation plans in effect under which incentive stock options  non qualified stock options  restricted stock awards rsas and stock appreciation rights sars are granted to employees and directors 
stock options and sars are granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
new shares are issued in settling stock option exercises and restricted stock awards 
effective march  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r supersedes accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb and related interpretations and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in the financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values and does not allow the previously permitted pro forma disclosure only method as an alternative to financial statement recognition 
sfas r also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required under previous literature 
in march the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which provides guidance regarding the interaction of sfas r and certain sec rules and regulations 
the company considered the provisions of sab in its adoption of sfas r 
the company elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas r 
accordingly  prior periods have not been revised to reflect the impact of sfas r 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized for fiscal year includes i compensation cost for all stock based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  february  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  and previously presented in the pro forma footnote disclosures  and ii compensation cost for all stock based payments granted or modified subsequent to february  based on fair values estimated in accordance with the new provisions of sfas no 
r 
in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
r  the company elected the long form method in determining our additional paid in capital pool of windfall benefits and the graded vesting method to amortize compensation expense over the service period 
the estimated value of the company s stock based awards including stock options  restricted stock awards and stock appreciation rights  less expected forfeitures  is amortized over the awards respective requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period  on a straight line basis 
as a result of adopting sfas no 
r  income from operations and income before income taxes for the 
table of contents twelve month period ended february  decreased by million from what would have been reported on the prior accounting basis 
net income for the twelve month period ended february  decreased by approximately million 
basic and diluted earnings per share decreased by and  respectively 
the implementation of sfas no 
r increased cash flows from financing activities by million during fiscal share based compensation recognized in fiscal as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
r  as well as pro forma disclosures according to the original provisions of sfas no 
for periods prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  use the black scholes option pricing model for estimating the fair value of options and sars granted 
the black scholes model requires certain assumptions  judgements and estimates by the company to determine fair value  including expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected life 
the company based the expected volatility on historical volatility 
additionally  the company based the expected life of options  rsas and sars granted on an actuarial model 
share based compensation related to rsas is calculated based on the market price of the company s common stock on the date of grant 
there were no dividends expected to be paid on the company s common stock over the expected lives estimated 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these estimated losses are based upon historical bad debts  specific customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company regularly performs credit evaluations consisting primarily of reviews of its customers financial condition  using information provided by the customers as well as publicly available information  if any 
if the financial condition of an individual customer or group of customers deteriorates  resulting in such customers inability to make payments within approved credit terms  additional allowances may be required 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  and intangible assets  are monitored and reviewed for impairment in value whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the related asset and its eventual disposition 
the estimated cash flows are based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance  growth rates and other factors 
estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to factors such as technological changes  economic conditions  and changes in the company s business model or operating performance 
if at the time of such evaluation the sum of expected undiscounted cash flows excluding interest is below the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized  which is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
goodwill is tested for impairment in value annually  as well as when an event or circumstance occurs indicating a possible impairment in value 
the company completed its most recent annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of fiscal  during which no impairment in value was identified 
unless an indicator of impairment is identified earlier  the next goodwill impairment review will be performed in the fourth quarter of fiscal marketable and non marketable long term equity investments are also monitored for indications of impairment in value 
the company records an impairment charge against these investments when the investment is judged to have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
judgments regarding the value of non marketable equity investments are subjective and dependent upon management s assessment of the performance of the investee and its prospects for future success 
as of february   the company had no significant long term equity investments 
income taxes accounting for income tax obligations requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  using enacted tax rates  for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and 
table of contents liabilities 
deferred tax assets resulting from these differences must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the company regularly evaluates the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its forecasts of future taxable income and reviewing available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the deferred tax assets 
at february   the company had million of deferred tax assets considered fully realizable and million of deferred tax liabilities 
factors that may affect the company s ability to achieve sufficient future taxable income for purposes of realizing its deferred tax assets include declines in sales and revenues or gross profit  increased competition and loss of market share  delays in product availability  and technological obsolescence 
legal contingencies from time to time  the company is subject to legal proceedings and claims  including claims of alleged infringement of patents and other intellectual property rights and other claims arising in the ordinary course of business 
these contingencies require management to assess the likelihood and possible cost of adverse judgments or outcomes 
liabilities for legal contingencies are accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
there can be no assurance that any third party assertions against the company will be resolved without costly litigation  in a manner that is not adverse to its financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  the resolution of any future intellectual property litigation may subject the company to royalty obligations  product redesigns or discontinuance of products  any of which could adversely impact future profitability 
recent accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
the objective of sfas no 
is to provide opportunities to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  smsc s fiscal year ending february  
the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on its financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in june  fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for income tax uncertainties fin 
fin defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
the recently issued literature also provides guidance on the de recognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
fin also includes guidance concerning accounting for income tax uncertainties in interim periods and increases the level of disclosures associated with any recorded income tax uncertainties 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  smsc s fiscal year ending february  
the differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
the company is still evaluating the impact  if any  of adopting the provisions of fin on its consolidated financial position and results of operations during fiscal in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab no

applying the provisions of sab no 
had no material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations during our fiscal year ended february

   and r sfas 
sfas requires an employer to recognize the over funded or under funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
sfas also requires the measurement of defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position with limited exceptions 
under sfas  the company is required to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures commencing as of february  on february   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas  the effect of which is disclosed in part iv item a financial statements note business acquisition on march   smsc announced the acquisition of karlsruhe  germany based oasis siliconsystems holding ag oasis  a leading provider of media oriented systems transport most or most technology  serving a top tier customer base of leading automakers and automotive suppliers 
oasis infotainment networking technology has been widely adopted by many european luxury and mid market car brands  including audi  bmw  daimlerchrysler  land rover  porsche  saab and volvo 
the initial cost of the acquisition at march  was approximately million  including approximately million of cash  million shares of smsc common stock  valued at million  and an estimated million of direct acquisition costs  including legal  banking  accounting and valuation fees 
included with the net assets acquired from oasis were approximately million of cash and cash equivalents  therefore smsc s initial net cash outlay for the transaction  including transaction costs  was approximately million 
the terms of the agreement also provided the former oasis shareholders the opportunity to earn up to million of additional consideration  based upon achieving certain fiscal performance goals  the amount earned of which was indeterminable until february  based upon fiscal performance and per the computation completed and submitted on april   the former oasis shareholders earned approximately million of additional consideration  consisting of approximately million shares of smsc common stock valued for accounting purposes as of may  at million  and approximately million of cash  all of which was tendered and paid during the first quarter of fiscal smsc s existing cash balances were used to fund the cash portion of the additional consideration 
the fair value of the shares tendered was approximately million less at the settlement date than had been estimated as of february   resulting in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill in the first quarter of fiscal refer to part iv item a financial statements note  for additional information on the final computation and settlement of this obligation
