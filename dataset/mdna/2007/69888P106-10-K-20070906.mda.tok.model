the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s condensed consolidated financial statement and related notes to condensed consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this form k 
overview critical to the growth of the company is its introduction of new manufactured and distributed products at selling prices that generate adequate gross margins 
the company  through its internal generic development program and various strategic alliances and relationships  seeks to introduce new products that have less competition and to broaden its product list 
the company plans to continue to invest in its generic internal research and development efforts  brand marketing strategy and its strategic alliances and relationships throughout and beyond 
also  the company will continue seeking additional products for sale through new and existing distribution agreements or acquisitions of complementary products and businesses  additional first to file opportunities and unique dosage forms to differentiate its products in the marketplace 
the company pays a percentage of the gross profits or sales to its strategic partners on sales of products covered by its distribution agreements 
generally  products that the company develops internally  and to which it is not required to split any profits with strategic partners  contribute higher gross margins than products covered by distribution agreements 
these efforts resulted in higher sales in from new product introductions  including fluticasone pursuant to a supply and distribution agreement with gsk  several other products pursuant to agreements with teva  ivax  and orchid chemicals pharmaceuticals ltd 
including amoxicillin products and cefprozil  and the launch of cabergoline in december of in  these efforts resulted in the company receiving final approval from the fda for tramadol hcl and acetaminophen tablets  which began shipping in april and megace es  the company s first branded pharmaceutical product  which it began shipping in july the company s business plan includes developing and marketing branded drugs as part of its effort to add products with longer life cycles and higher profitability to the company s product line 
in july of  the company received fda approval for its first new drug application nda  filed pursuant to section b of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  and immediately began marketing megestrol acetate oral suspension nanocrystal dispersion megace es 
megace es is indicated for the treatment of anorexia  cachexia or any unexplained significant weight loss in patients with a diagnosis of aids and is utilizing the megace brand name that the company has licensed from bristol myers squibb company bms 
the company has progressed on its business plan during by acquiring the rights to additional branded products currently in phase iii clinical trials 
the company acquired the commercialization rights in the us to immtech pharmaceuticals immtech lead oral drug candidate  pafuramidine maleate  for the treatment of pneumocystis pneumonia in aids patients 
the company also acquired an exclusive licensing agreement under which the company will receive commercialization rights in the us to bioalliance pharma s loramyc 
table of contents miconazole lauriad  an antifungal therapy for the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis  an opportunistic infection commonly found in immunocompromised patients  including those with hiv and cancer 
the company also acquired the north american commercial rights to zensanatm ondansetron hcl oral spray from hana biosciences  inc hana 
ondansetron is used to prevent nausea and vomiting after chemotherapy  radiation and surgery  and following successful development and approval  zensanatm could be among the first in its class of ht antagonist anti emetic therapies to be available in an oral spray form 
the company also announced that it has entered into an agreement with novadel  to collaborate in the reformulation of zensanatm 
following completion of reformulation efforts already under way  the company will reconfirm the product s pharmacokinetic profile and resubmit the nda to the fda 
for additional information on these agreements and other similar matters  refer to subsequent events below 
in addition to the substantial costs of product development  the company may incur significant legal costs in bringing certain products to market 
litigation concerning patents and proprietary rights is often protracted and expensive 
pharmaceutical companies with patented brand products are increasingly suing companies that produce generic forms of their patented brand name products for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights  which could delay or prevent the entry of such generic products into the market 
generally  a generic drug may not be marketed until the applicable patent s on the brand name drug expires 
when an anda is filed with the fda for approval of a generic drug  the filing person may certify either that the patent listed by the fda as covering the branded product is about to expire  in which case the anda will not become effective until the expiration of such patent  or that the patent listed as covering the branded drug is invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture  sale or use of the new drug for which the anda is filed 
in either case  there is a risk that a brand pharmaceutical company may sue the filing person for alleged patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights 
because a substantial portion of the company s current business involves the marketing and development of generic versions of brand products  the threat of litigation  the outcome of which is inherently uncertain  is always present 
such litigation is often costly and time consuming  and could result in a substantial delay in  or prevent  the introduction and or marketing of products  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  prospects and results of operations 
sales and gross margins of the company s products depend principally on the i introduction of other generic drug manufacturers products in direct competition with the company s significant products  ii ability of generic competitors to quickly enter the market after patent or exclusivity period expirations  or during exclusivity periods with authorized generic products  diminishing the amount and duration of significant profits to the company from any one product  iii pricing practices of competitors and the removal of competing products from the market  iv continuation of existing distribution agreements  v introduction of new distributed products  vi consolidation among distribution outlets through mergers  acquisitions and the formation of buying groups  vii willingness of generic drug customers  including wholesale and retail customers  to switch among generic pharmaceutical manufacturers  viii approval of andas and introduction of new manufactured products  ix granting of potential marketing exclusivity periods  x extent of market penetration for the existing product line  xi level  quality and amount of customer service  and xii market acceptance of the company s recently introduced branded product

net sales and gross margins derived from generic pharmaceutical products often follow a pattern based on regulatory and competitive factors that are believed by the company s management to be unique to the generic pharmaceutical industry 
as the patent s for a brand name product and the related exclusivity period s expire  the first generic manufacturer to receive regulatory approval from the fda for a generic equivalent of the product is often able to capture a substantial share of the market 
at that time  however  the branded company may license an authorized generic product to a competing generic company

critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those policies that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments  resulting from the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting policies  as discussed below  pertain to revenue recognition and the determination of deductions from gross revenues  the determination of whether certain costs pertaining to the company s significant development and marketing agreements are to be capitalized or expensed as incurred  the valuation and assessment of impairment of intangible assets  the determination of depreciable and amortizable lives and issues related to legal proceedings 
in applying such policies  management often must use amounts that are based on its informed judgments and estimates 
because of the uncertainties inherent in these estimates  actual results could differ from the estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies 
the company is not aware of any likely events or circumstances that would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
revenue recognition and provisions for deductions from gross revenues the company recognizes revenues for product sales when title and risk of loss have transferred to its customers and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
this is generally at the time products are received by the customers 
upon recognizing revenue from sales  the company records estimates for the following items that reduce gross revenues chargebacks rebates and incentive programs product returns cash discounts and other medicaid rebates the following table summarizes the activity for the years ended december   and in the accounts affected by the estimated provisions described below  in thousands for the year ended december  provision provision recorded reversal for current recorded beginning period for prior credits ending accounts receivable reserves balance sales period sales processed balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities medicaid rebates 
table of contents for the year ended december  provision provision recorded reversal for current recorded beginning period for prior credits ending accounts receivable reserves balance sales period sales processed balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities medicaid rebates for the year ended december  provision provision recorded reversal for current recorded beginning period for prior credits ending accounts receivable reserves balance sales period sales processed balance chargebacks rebates and incentive programs returns cash discounts and other total accrued liabilities medicaid rebates the amount of provision or reversal of reserves related to prior periods for chargebacks is not determinable on a product or customer specific basis  however  based upon analysis of activity in subsequent periods  the company has determined its chargeback estimates remain reasonable 
the company sells its products directly to wholesalers  retail drug store chains  drug distributors  mail order pharmacies and other direct purchasers and customers that purchase its products indirectly through the wholesalers  including independent pharmacies  non warehousing retail drug store chains  managed health care providers and other indirect purchasers 
the company has entered into agreements at negotiated contract prices with those health care providers that purchase products through the company s wholesale customers at those contract prices 
chargeback credits are issued to wholesalers for the difference between the company s invoice price to the wholesaler and the contract price through which the product is resold to health care providers 
approximately and of the company s net product sales were derived from the wholesale distribution channel for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the information that the company considers when establishing its chargeback reserves includes contract and non contract sales trends  average historical contract pricing  actual price changes  processing time lags and customer inventory information from its three largest wholesale customers 
the company s chargeback provision and related reserve vary with changes in product mix  changes in customer pricing and changes to estimated wholesaler inventory 
customer rebates and incentive programs are generally provided to customers as an incentive for the customers to continue to carry the company s products or replace competing products in their distribution channels with those products sold by the company 
rebate programs are based on a customer s dollar purchases made during an applicable monthly  quarterly or annual period 
the company also provides indirect rebates  which are rebates paid to indirect customers that have purchased our products from a wholesaler under a contract with the company 
the incentive programs include stocking or trade show promotions where additional discounts may be given on a new product or certain existing products as an added incentive to stock the company s products 
the company may  from time to time  also provide price and or volume incentives on new products that have multiple competitors and or on existing products that confront new competition in order to attempt to secure or maintain a certain market share 
the information that the company considers when establishing its rebate and incentive program reserves are rebate agreements with and purchases by each customer  tracking and analysis of promotional offers  projected annual sales for customers with annual incentive programs  actual rebates and incentive payments made  processing time lags  and for indirect rebates  the level of inventory in the distribution 
table of contents channel that will be subject to indirect rebates 
the company does not provide incentives designed to increase shipments to its customers that it believes would result in out of the ordinary course of business inventory for them 
the company regularly reviews and monitors estimated or actual customer inventory information at its three largest wholesale customers for its key products to ascertain whether customer inventories are in excess of ordinary course of business levels 
pursuant to a drug rebate agreement with the centers for medicare and medicaid services and similar supplemental agreements with various states  the company provides such states with a rebate on drugs dispensed under the medicaid program 
the company determines its estimate of medicaid rebate accrual primarily based on historical experience of claims submitted by the various states and any new information regarding changes in the medicaid program that might impact the company s provision for medicaid rebates 
in determining the appropriate accrual amount the company considers historical payment rates  processing lag for outstanding claims and payments  and levels of inventory in the distribution channel 
the company reviews the accrual and assumptions on a quarterly basis against actual claims data to help ensure that the liability is fairly stated 
the company accepts returns of product according to the following criteria i the product returns must be approved by authorized personnel in writing or by telephone with the lot number and expiration date accompanying any request  and ii the company generally will accept returns of products from any customer and will provide the customer with a credit memo for such returns if such products are returned within six months prior to  and until months following  such products expiration date 
the company records a provision for product returns based on historical experience  including actual rate of expired and damaged returns  average remaining shelf lives of products sold  which generally range from to months  and estimated return dates 
additionally the company considers other factors when estimating its current period return provision  including levels of inventory in the distribution channel  significant market changes that may impact future expected returns  and actual product returns and may record additional provisions for specific returns that it believes are not covered by the historical rates 
the company offers cash discounts to its customers  generally of the sales price  as an incentive for paying within invoice terms  which generally range from to days 
the company accounts for cash discounts by reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts that the company expects its customers to take 
in addition to the significant gross to net sales adjustments described above  the company periodically makes other sales adjustments 
the company generally accounts for these other gross to net adjustments by establishing an accrual in the amount equal to its estimate of the adjustments attributable to the sale 
the company may at its discretion provide price adjustments due to various competitive factors  through shelf stock adjustments on existing inventory levels 
there are circumstances under which the company may not provide price adjustments to certain customers and consequently  as a matter of business strategy  may lose future sales volume to competitors rather than reduce its pricing 
as detailed above  the company has the experience and access to relevant information that it believes are necessary to reasonably estimate the amounts of such deductions from gross revenues 
some of the assumptions used by the company for certain of its estimates are based on information received from third parties  such as wholesale customer inventory data and market data  or other market factors beyond the company s control 
the estimates that are most critical to the establishment of these reserves  and therefore would have the largest impact if these estimates were not accurate  are estimates related to expected contract sales volumes  average contract pricing  customer inventories and return levels 
the company regularly reviews the information related to these estimates and adjusts its reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
with the exception of the product returns allowance  the ending balances of account receivable reserves and allowances generally are eliminated during a two to four month period  on average 
use of estimates in reserves the company believes that its reserves  allowances and accruals for items that are deducted from gross revenues are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
it is possible  however  that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different allowance and accrual amounts for items that are deducted from gross revenues 
additionally  changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause the company s allowances and accruals to fluctuate  particularly with newly launched or acquired products 
the company reviews the rates and amounts in its allowance and accrual estimates on a quarterly basis 
if future estimated rates and amounts are significantly greater than those reflected in its recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would decrease the company s reported net revenues  conversely  if actual product returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than those reflected in its recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would increase its reported net revenues 
if the company changed its assumptions and estimates  its reserves would change  which would impact the net revenues the company reports 
the company regularly reviews the information related to these estimates and adjusts its reserves accordingly  if and when actual experience differs from previous estimates 
research and development agreements the company capitalizes or expenses amounts related to the development of new products and technologies through agreements with third parties based on the company s determination of its ability to recover in a reasonable period of time its cost from the estimated future cash flows anticipated to be generated pursuant to each agreement 
accordingly  amounts related to the company s funding of the research and development efforts of others or to the purchase of contractual rights to products that have not 
table of contents been approved by the fda  and where the company has no alternative future use for the product  are expensed and included in research and development costs 
amounts for contractual rights acquired by the company to a process  product or other legal right having multiple or alternative future uses that support its realizability  as well as to an approved product  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill and intangible assets the company determines the estimated fair values of goodwill and certain intangible assets with definitive lives based on valuations performed by the company at the time of their acquisition in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
in addition  the fair value of certain amounts paid to third parties related to the development of new products and technologies  as described above  are capitalized and included in intangible assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
intangible assets are reviewed quarterly  or when events or other changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles is determined to exist when the fair value is less than the carrying value of the net assets being tested 
impairment of definite lived intangibles is determined to exist when undiscounted cash flows related to the assets are less than the carrying value of the assets being tested 
as discussed above with respect to determining an asset s fair value and useful life  because this process involves management making certain estimates and because these estimates for the basis of the determination of whether or not an impairment charge should be recorded  these estimates are considered to be critical accounting estimates 
as of december   the company determined through its estimates that no impairment of goodwill or intangible assets existed 
the company will continue to assess the carrying value of its goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting guidance 
as discussed in notes to consolidated financial statements note intangible assets  the company impaired intangible assets of  in and  in as a result of the acquisition of kali in  the company had amounts recorded as goodwill of  at december  and  at december  in addition  intangible assets with definite lives  net of accumulated amortization  totaled  and  respectively  at december  and item a
