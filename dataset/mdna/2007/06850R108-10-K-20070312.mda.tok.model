overview we are a pharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products in the field of dermatology 
our strategy is to become a leader in the development and commercialization of proprietary innovative products in therapeutic dermatology 
we currently market three pharmaceutical products in the united states  xolegel ketoconazole  usp gel  vusion miconazole nitrate  zinc oxide  and white petrolatum ointment and solag mequinol and tretinoin topical solution 
we also market our solag product in canada  along with two other products for which we are the exclusive distributor in canada vaniqa elflornithine hcl cream and denavir penciclovir cream 
we promote our marketed products through a sales force consisting of our own sales representatives and those of a contract sales organization 
since the approval of vusion in february  we increased our sales and marketing efforts significantly  including an expansion of our us sales force from to us representatives 
we also completed our pre launch marketing and manufacturing activities for xolegel  and commenced our commercial launch in the fourth quarter of we have other product candidates in various stages of clinical development for the treatment of a range of dermatological conditions  including acne  psoriasis  onychomycosis and fungal infections 
in addition  we have access to the classes of compounds claimed in the patents licensed to us under our license agreements with affiliates of johnson johnson 
the development of each of our product candidates involves significant risks 
no assessment of the efficacy or safety of any product candidate can be considered definitive until all clinical trials needed to support a submission for marketing approval are completed 
in  we recognized total product revenues of million mostly related to our vusion sales in the united states and sales of solag in the united states and canada 
in  we recognized total product revenues of million for our sales of solag in the united states and canada and sales of vaniqa in canada 
we expect product revenues to increase in  primarily due to the anticipated growth in sales for our vusion and xolegel products 
we have financed our operations and internal growth almost entirely through proceeds from private placements of preferred stock  our initial public offering in the second quarter of and our follow on public offerings in the first quarter of and in the third quarter of we were incorporated in september and commenced active operations in may since our inception we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we plan to continue to invest in the clinical development of our product candidates and screen for new product candidates 
we also plan to seek marketing approvals for our products in various countries throughout the world  particularly in the united states and canada 
we expect to continue to spend significant amounts on the commercial development of our products  including the sales and marketing of xolegel  vusion and solag 
accordingly  we will need to generate significantly greater revenues to achieve and then maintain profitability 
additionally  we plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of development stage or approved products that would fit within our growth strategy 
research and clinical development expenses represent cost incurred for the conduct of our clinical trials  cost related to pre clinical studies  including toxicology and pharmacokinetics  cost incurred in screening for new product candidates  manufacturing development costs related to our clinical product candidates  personnel and related costs related to our research and product development activities including stock based compensation expense as required under fas r  and outside professional fees related to clinical development and regulatory matters 
we outsource the conduct of our pre clinical studies  clinical trials and all of our manufacturing development activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
we expense these research and development costs as they are incurred 
we expect that our research and development expenses will be somewhat higher in compared to  mostly related to our ongoing hyphanox phase study in onychomychosis and the completion of our two phase b studies in oral rambazole and azoline 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related personnel costs  marketing and promotion  general corporate activities  professional fees and facilities costs 
we expect these costs to increase in  as we continue to increase our commercial efforts in support of vusion  xolegel  and solag 
in addition  if we were to acquire or in license other products  we would then incur sales and marketing costs related to such products 
we expect to continue to incur net losses over the next several years as we continue our clinical development  apply for regulatory approvals  enter into arrangements with third parties for manufacturing and distribution services and market our products 
we have a limited history of operations and anticipate that our quarterly results of operations will fluctuate for several reasons  including the timing and extent of recognition of product and other revenues  the timing of any contract  license fee or royalty payments that we may receive or be required to make  the timing and outcome of our applications for regulatory approvals  the timing and extent of marketing and selling expenses  the timing and extent of our research and development efforts  the timing and extent of our adding new employees and infrastructure  and the timing and extent of employee stock grants and stock option grants 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements appearing at the end of this annual report on form k  we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
revenue recognition we use revenue recognition criteria in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf and statement of financial accounting standards no fas revenue recognition when right of return exists 
revenue arrangements that include multiple deliverables are divided into separate units of accounting if the deliverables meet certain criteria  including whether the fair value of the delivered items can be determined and whether there is evidence of fair value of the undelivered items 
in addition  the consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their fair values  and the applicable revenue recognition criteria are considered separately for each of the separate units of accounting 
net product revenue 
in the united states and canada  we sell our products primarily to wholesalers and distributors  who  in turn  sell to pharmacies 
the following are our revenue recognition policies 
new product launch at the time of a new product launch  we utilize a pull through sales method that recognizes revenue based on estimated prescription demand based on third party market research data and revenue for a normal level of wholesaler inventory based on our estimated current prescription demand 
estimating the amount of returns and discounts for new products is based on specific facts and circumstances including acceptance rates from established products with similar marketing characteristics 
at the time of a new product launch  absent the ability to make reliable estimates  we defer revenue on sales to wholesalers until we can make reliable estimates of returns  discounts and related end user demand 
we attempt to monitor our inventory levels at our wholesalers and pharmacies to ensure these levels remain within normal levels 
we estimate inventory at wholesalers based on historical sales to wholesalers  inventory data provided to us by these wholesalers and from third party market research data related to prescription trends and patient demand 
making these determinations involves estimating whether trends in past buying patterns will predict future product sales 
product sales allowances we record product sales net of the following significant categories of product sales allowances prompt payment discounts  wholesaler fees  returns  coupons  discounts for medicaid  managed care and governmental contracts 
in determining allowances for product returns  coupons and medicaid rebates  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
for example  in determining these amounts  we estimate prescription demand and the levels of inventory held by wholesalers 
making these determinations involves estimating whether trends in past buying patterns will predict future product sales 
calculating some of these items involves significant estimates and judgments and requires us to use information from external sources 
returns customers can return short dated or expired product that meets the guidelines set forth in our return goods policy 
returns are accepted from wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
wholesaler customers can return short dated product with six months or less shelf life remaining and expired product within twelve months following the expiration date 
retail pharmacies are not permitted to return short dated product but can return full or partial quantities of expired product only within twelve months following the expiration date 
we base our estimates of product returns for each of our products on the percentage of returns that we have experienced historically or based on industry data for similar products 
notwithstanding this  we may adjust our estimate of product returns if we are aware of other factors that we believe could meaningfully impact our expected return percentages 
these factors could include  among others  our estimates of inventory levels of our products in the distribution channel  known sales trends and existing or anticipated competitive market forces such as product entrants and or pricing changes 
in  we recorded a provision for returns at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual returns could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns activity because of several factors  including  among other things  wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and or competition 
if the returns provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our three products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of  would result 
rebates patient discount coupons from time to time we offer patients the opportunity to obtain free or discounted products through a program whereby physicians provide coupons or payment cards to qualified patients for redemption at retail pharmacies 
we reimburse retail pharmacies for the cost of these products through a third party administrator 
we recognize the estimated cost of this reimbursement as a reduction of gross sales when product is sold 
as a result of these patient discount and coupon offers  at the time of product shipment  we must estimate the likelihood that products sold to wholesalers and pharmacies might be ultimately sold to a patient who redeems a coupon 
we base our estimates on the historic coupon redemption rates for similar products we receive from third party administrators  which detail historic patterns 
we maintain an accrual for unused coupons based on inventory in the distribution channel and historical coupon usage rates and adjust this accrual whenever changes in such coupon usage rates occur 
in  we recorded a provision for coupons at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual coupon usage could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future coupon activity 
if the coupons provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our three products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of  would result 
rebates medicaid discounts in some states we participate or have applied to participate in the federal medicaid rebate program  as well as several state government managed supplemental medicaid rebate programs  which were developed to provide assistance to certain vulnerable and needy individuals and families 
under the medicaid rebate program  we pay a rebate to each participating state and local government for our products that their programs reimburse 
for purposes of this discussion  discounts and rebates provided through these programs are considered medicaid rebates and are included in our medicaid rebate accrual 
we record accruals for medicaid rebates as a reduction of sales when product is sold to our wholesaler distributors 
these reductions are based on historical rebate amounts and trends of sales eligible for these governmental programs for a period  as well as any expected changes to the trends of our total product sales 
in addition  we estimate the expected unit rebate amounts to be used and adjust our rebate accruals based on the expected changes in rebate pricing 
rebate amounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
we analyze the accrual at least quarterly and will adjust the balance as required 
in  we recorded a provision for medicaid discounts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual medicaid discounts could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future medicaid patient activity or unit rebate amounts 
if the medicaid discounts provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our four products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of  million would result 
we will adjust our allowances for product returns  medicaid and coupon rebates based on our actual sales experience  and we will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances in the future 
we continually monitor our allowances and make adjustments when we believe actual experience may differ from our estimates 
international distribution partners 
under our agreements with international distribution partners  we sell our product to our distribution partners at a contractual price 
these partners generally have no rights of return after they have accepted shipment of the product 
other revenues 
contract revenues include license fees and other payments associated with collaborations with third parties 
revenue is generally recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from non refundable  upfront license fees where we have a continuing involvement is recognized ratably over the performance period 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates of the performance period and revise our assumptions as appropriate 
these changes in assumptions may affect the amount of revenue recorded in our financial statements in future periods 
grant revenues are recognized when we provide the services stipulated in the underlying grant based on the time and materials incurred up to the amount of grant payments received 
amounts received in advance of services provided are recorded as deferred revenue and amortized as revenue when the services are provided 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  and include the cost of raw materials  labor  overhead and shipping and handling costs 
cost is computed on inventories using the first in  first out fifo method 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in our opinion  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  we establish a reserve against the inventories carrying value 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
we base our analysis  in part  on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements for forecasted product demand and the expiration dates of inventories 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated decreases in demand could have a material impact on the carrying value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
in  inventory adjustments totaled million 
we expense our inventory costs associated with products prior to regulatory approval as research and development expense 
we have committed to make future minimum payments to third parties for certain product inventories 
the minimum purchase commitments total million as of december   the majority of which relate to vusion and xolegel 
we expect to fully utilize these contracts 
marketable securities investments classified as available for sale are carried at estimated fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
eitf  the meaning of other than temporary requires disclosures addressing other than temporary impairments in a qualitative and quantitative manner 
there were no other than temporary impairments through december  intangible assets product rights are being amortized on a straight line basis over the life of the underlying patent  which expires in we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the carrying value of its intangible assets 
an impairment may be recognized if the expected future undiscounted cash flows are less than their carrying amounts 
as of december   no impairment exists 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  accounting for stock based compensation fas r using the modified prospective method 
fas r requires companies to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of all share based payments granted to employees 
we commenced the new method of valuing stock based compensation as prescribed by fas r on all stock based awards granted after the effective date 
for year ended december   we recorded an expense for stock based compensation related to fas r of million  million of which was recorded in research and development expense and million was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
prior to january   as allowed by sfas  we had applied the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed in apb and its related interpretations  and  accordingly  did not recognize compensation expense for stock option grants made at an exercise price equal to or in excess of the fair market value of the stock at the date of grant 
for pro forma purposes  the stock compensation expense was based on an accelerated vesting method 
sfas pro forma information regarding net loss was required by sfas  and had been determined as if we had accounted for its stock based employee compensation under the fair value method prescribed in sfas the fair values of the options were estimated using the black scholes pricing model 
in addition  no compensation expense was recorded in the financial statements for shares purchased under our employee stock purchase plan as that plan was considered non compensatory under apb in addition  prior to the adoption of fas r  we presented our unamortized portion of deferred compensation cost for nonvested stock options in the statement of changes in shareholders equity with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital 
upon the adoption of fas r  these amounts were offset against each other 
under fas r  an equity instrument is not considered to be issued until the instrument vests 
as a result  compensation cost is recognized over the requisite service period with an offsetting credit to additional paid in capital  and the deferred compensation balance of  at december  was netted against additional paid in capital 
apb did not permit the estimation of forfeitures for the unvested awards outstanding  and therefore forfeitures were recognized as they occurred 
under fas r  an estimate of forfeitures must be made for the unvested awards outstanding as of the adoption date 
as such  an adjustment to record the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is needed to reflect the compensation cost that would not have been recognized in prior periods had forfeitures been estimated during those periods 
this adjustment applies only to compensation cost previously recognized in the financial statements for awards that are unvested on the adoption date 
as such  we recognized a cumulative effect adjustment of  as of january  related to the accounting change for forfeitures 
fas r does not change the accounting guidance for how we account for options issued to non employees 
we account for options issued to non employees under sfas no 
and eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services 
as such  the value of such options is periodically re measured and income or expense is recognized during their vesting terms 
we recorded   and  non employee stock compensation expense for years ended december    and  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 and fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact this provision may have on our financial position or results of operations 
fin is an interpretation of sfas statement no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation requires that we recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition of a previously recognized tax position  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods and disclosures 
the provisions of fin are effective beginning january  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we are in the process of evaluating the potential impact of fin we currently have a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets and therefore have not recognized the benefits from our tax positions in our earnings 
we anticipate the impact  if any  of fin to be minimal

accruals for state medicaid rebates and wholesaler fees totaled million and million at december   respectively  and are included in accrued liabilities 
at december   we had no accrued liabilities for state medicaid rebates and wholesaler fees 
deferred revenue of  at december   primarily reflects the deferral of sales related to the xolegel launch in the us along with some canadian sales 
deferred revenue of  at december   reflects primarily the deferral of contract milestones related to our distribution agreements and some canadian sales 
the following table summarizes our gross to net revenue deductions year ended december  in thousands gross product revenues cash discounts wholesaler fees medicaid rebates coupon rebates product returns chargebacks total net product revenues other revenues

during  we also conducted a confirmatory phase clinical trial for xolegel 
our costs related to vusion for increased million compared to primarily due to increased costs for manufacturing development and regulatory costs 
in  we incurred costs related to validation batches as well as a contract minimum payment made to our contract manufacturer 
vusion costs for the year ended december  included our phase pivotal clinical trial  which began enrolling patients in the first half of and was completed during the third quarter of  and the costs incurred in connection with the preparation of regulatory filings and filing fees in the united states and europe 
hyphanox hyphanox costs of million in related primarily to the commencement of our phase clinical study in onychomycosis 
hyphanox costs in decreased million from primarily due to the absence of the clinical cost for the phase trial in vaginal candidiasis  or vvc  conducted in and our costs for hyphanox for are related to the completion of the vvc trial  supportive pharmacokinetics studies  and set up costs for a phase clinical trial for the treatment of onychomycosis 
the costs were million  or  lower than  because the phase trial ran for only six months of compared to twelve months of manufacturing development costs in were also lower for hyphanox as compared to rambazole rambazole expenses for year ended december  compared to year ended december  increased million primarily due to costs related to the phase b study in psoriasis and manufacturing development and pre clinical studies 
rambazole costs for increased over primarily due to higher manufacturing development and preclinical study costs 
azoline azoline expenses for year ended december  compared to year ended december  decreased million 
increased clinical costs related to the phase b study were more than offset by savings in manufacturing development expenses 
azoline expenses in increased million over levels

in  azoline expenses of million included proof of concept and preclinical studies 
liarozole liarozole expenses for year ended december  compared to year ended december  increased million primarily due to conduct of the phase trial for the treatment of lamellar ichthyosis in  offset in part by lower manufacturing and pre clinical expenses in our costs for liarozole in were marginally higher than our costs in our costs in are related to the set up costs for our phase trial for the treatment of lamellar ichthyosis as well as costs for clinical supplies and manufacturing of the active ingredient 
our costs for liarozole in related to the cost of the review of clinical data and the manufacturing of both the active ingredient and clinical supplies 
other pre clinical clinical stage products these expenses generally encompass direct expenses relating to the development of our research and preclinical product candidates  including ecalcidene  which was discontinued in  and the screening of molecules to identify new product candidates 
internal costs internal research and development expenses  including personnel and related costs and stock compensation  decreased million as compared to the corresponding period in internal costs for the year ended december  reflect million lower personnel  consulting and related costs offset in part by million of stock compensation expense under fas r 
internal costs for increased million compared to personnel and related costs totaled million for  an increase of million over the corresponding period in this increase is primarily due to an increase in personnel  partially offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred compensation of million 
other costs  which include consultants  overhead and other expenses  totaled million  an increase of million compared to the corresponding period in there was no stock compensation expense under fas r in and we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase as we further advance our mid and late stage product candidates through clinical development 
in addition  we will continue to incur expenses for our earlier stage research and preclinical projects 
we also expect our personnel and related expenses for research and development to remain at current levels 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to the same period in this increase was mainly due to million of additional selling costs related to the expansion of our sales force  million of marketing and infrastructure cost associated with the launch of two new us products and million of stock compensation expense under fas r  partially offset by million lower general and administrative expenses

commercial infrastructure  marketing and market research commercial expenses increased million in primarily due to higher brand marketing and market research expenses compared to the same period in this increase is related to costs for the launch of vusion and xolegel  and support of our other commercial products in the us  canada and europe 
in we also increased spending on our commercial infrastructure by million over this increase includes commercial management  supply chain expenses and support staff 
marketing expenses in increased million  and included costs for the launch and promotion of solag and preparation costs for the launch of vusion 
the commercial expenses included initial personnel and market research expenses 
corporate general and administrative expenses totaled million for  which represents a decrease of million compared to the same period in corporate administrative expenses in increased million from due to higher personnel  consulting  overhead and other expenses related to becoming a public company 
in we recorded million of stock compensation expense under fas r in selling  general and administrative expenses 
there were no expenses from fas r prior to our adoption in we expect sales force costs and brand marketing and market research costs to increase in as we have a full year of selling expenses related to our territory sales team  support the launch of xolegel and continue to invest in vusion and our other commercial products 
if we were to acquire or in license additional products the related sales and marketing costs may also increase 
we expect corporate administrative costs to increase modestly as required to support our growth 
interest income  net of interest expense 
interest income  net of interest expense  totaled million for  and was comparable to million for interest income in was million higher than the corresponding period in this increase was primarily due to our higher balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities from our initial public offering and follow on offering in compared to the period and higher average interest rates

since our inception  we have funded our operations principally from issuances of our convertible preferred stock  the proceeds from our initial public offering of common stock  our follow on public offering of common stock and a registered direct offering 
we raised net proceeds of approximately million from our public offering in september  million from our follow on public offering in february  million from our initial public offering in may  and we have issued preferred stock  including notes converted into preferred stock  for aggregate net cash proceeds of approximately million 
all of the preferred stock that we issued converted to common stock in connection with our initial public offering

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our exposure to market risk is limited to our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest in high quality financial instruments  primarily money market funds  federal agency notes  corporate debt securities and united states treasury notes  with the effective duration of the portfolio less than one year  which we believe are subject to limited credit risk 
we currently do not hedge our interest rate exposure 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we do not believe that we have any material exposure to interest rate risk arising from our investments 
most of our transactions are conducted in united states dollars  although we do have some agreements with vendors located outside the united states 
transactions under some of these agreements are conducted in united states dollars  subject to adjustment based on significant fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
transactions under other of these agreements are conducted in the local foreign currency 
we have a wholly owned subsidiary  barrier therapeutics  nv  which is located in geel  belgium and a wholly owned subsidiary  barrier therapeutics canada inc  which is located in toronto  canada 
except for funding being received under our grant from a belgian governmental agency which is denominated in euros  and locally earned interest income  all research costs incurred by barrier therapeutics  nv are funded under a service agreement with barrier therapeutics  inc from investments denominated in dollars 
our canadian subsidiary  barrier therapeutics canada  inc became operational in the third quarter of while we expect that there will be some income from sales of products during the next year which will be denominated in canadian dollars  most of the funding for these operations will also come from investments denominated in dollars 
therefore  we are subject to currency fluctuations and exchange rate gains and losses on these transactions 
if the exchange rate undergoes a change of  we do not believe that it would have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows
