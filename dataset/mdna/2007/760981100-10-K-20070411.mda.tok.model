in addition to our retail stores  we operate a direct to customer direct sales channel that includes both catalog and internet 
over the past several years  we have invested heavily in repositioning our brands and remodeling our stores  including 
table of contents in and  we began our repositioning efforts with the launch of a new merchandising strategy and the remodeling of our stores 
we made key changes to our assortment including refinements in premium textiles  bath fixtures and hardware  lighting and furniture

we also introduced our first outlet store 
our outlet store strategy is designed to enable us to more effectively liquidate overstocked  discontinued and damaged merchandise 
in  we remodeled the majority of our existing stores 
the remodeled stores enabled us to expand our merchandise offerings in certain core categories  particularly lighting and textiles  and to present those offerings with more clarity and focus 
we also opened one retail store and five outlet stores 
in  we continued to grow our direct to customer business with the addition of two category extensions  the restoration hardware outdoor catalog and the restoration hardware gift catalog

we believe our assortment and enhanced operational effectiveness will provide us with a strong foundation for future revenue growth  margin expansion and operational efficiencies 
although historically our business was divided into retail and direct to customer segments  we increasingly view and operate our company as a multi channel business in which our retail stores  internet website and catalog distribution are interdependent parts of a single business segment 
in particular  our catalog distribution drives sales across each of our retail  catalog and internet businesses  and our catalog  retail and internet businesses each complement each other by building customer awareness of our merchandise concepts  enhancing brand image and each to some extent helping to generate sales across channels 
in view of these changes in how we view and manage our business  during we implemented a management reorganization to take into account our multi channel strategy and to better focus our approach of driving the company s total revenue growth and operating efficiencies rather than managing each channel as a separate segment as was done historically 
as part of this reorganization  we shifted management responsibility from merchandising and marketing individual channels to merchandising and marketing across all channels 
accordingly  we have moved to a more unified view of the operation and management of our business 
we believe that we will increasingly operate and manage our business in this manner in the future 
summary consolidated statements of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated the amount and percentage of net revenue represented by certain line items in our consolidated statements of operations fiscal of net revenue fiscal of net revenue fiscal of net revenue dollars in thousands  except per share data retail net revenue direct to customer net revenue net revenue cost of revenue and occupancy gross profit selling  general and administrative expense income from operations interest expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss net income loss per share of common stock basic net income loss per share of common stock diluted 
table of contents results we experienced a substantial increase in income from operations during fiscal  which increased by million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was driven by higher sales and improvement in both our gross margins and selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues 
in addition  we generated net income of million or per share on a diluted net income per share basis 
this is a significant improvement from fiscal where we generated a net loss of million or per share on a diluted net loss per share basis 
the primary difference resulted from the recording of a million non cash charge in fiscal to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
the results for fiscal reflect million of pre tax non cash stock based compensation expense associated with the expensing of stock options as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which we adopted commencing from the first quarter of fiscal fiscal results also include an additional million in non cash cumulative stock option charge resulting from the voluntary review of our stock option grants further discussed in the section below entitled  voluntary review of stock option practices 
our net revenues increased by million  or  to million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase resulted from an million  or  increase in revenues in our direct to customer segment followed by a million  or  increase in our retail segment 
our strong growth in the direct to customer segment was driven by increases in page count in our core catalog  the increased circulation from the launches of the restoration hardware outdoor catalog and the restoration hardware gift catalog  and strong customer response to our spring  outdoor and summer offerings 
the increase in our retail segment resulted from a million increase in comparable store sales  million increase in outlet and warehouse sales  and million in non comparable store sales which includes the benefit of an additional week in fiscal 
our cost of revenue and occupancy increased but declined as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal this result drove a continued improvement in our gross margins primarily due to a reduction of occupancy costs as a percentage of net revenues 
the improvement in our gross margins was also due to our continued focus to grow our direct to customer segment which has a higher overall margin and increased at a higher rate than our retail segment 
our selling  general and administrative expense remained relatively consistent as a percentage of net revenues in fiscal compared to fiscal the total increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily a function of the cost to support the net revenue increase during the current fiscal year 
improvements in selling  general and administrative expenses included a decrease in store employment and other store variable costs and the absence of the million non cash charge for accelerated depreciation of certain fixtures associated with remodeling efforts related to the prior fiscal year 
these improvements were in part offset by increased advertising costs of million related to catalogs and the recording of million of pre tax stock based compensation expense as required by sfas r 
our interest expense increased by million  or  in fiscal over fiscal due to higher average debt levels to fund increased inventory levels for anticipated higher sales and higher average interest rates 
our fiscal income tax expense was million on pre tax income of million 
this is a significant decline from fiscal s income tax expense of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the primary difference resulted from the recording of a million non cash charge in fiscal to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
voluntary review of stock option practices 
during fiscal  we completed a voluntary review of our historical stock option practices that was overseen by the audit committee of our board of directors with the assistance of outside legal counsel 
we determined that incorrect measurement dates with respect to the accounting for certain previously granted stock options  primarily during the years through resulted from lapses in documentation and deficiencies in option plan administration controls 
the cumulative impact of the errors resulted in an additional non cash compensation charge of million  million in selling  general and administrative expenses and million in cost of revenue and occupancy  which was recorded in fiscal the cumulative charge was reported in fiscal since the amount of the stock option compensation expense attributable to each of the previous periods was not material to any previously reported historical period and was not material to the current fiscal year 
we currently are assessing the impact  if any  of negative tax consequences that might arise from certain affected employees as a result of this matter 
we may decide to compensate those employees for any such negative tax consequences that have arisen 
any such compensation that we may elect to make to the employees for any negative tax effects would be recorded at the time that a decision is made as to this matter 
results income from operations decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we recorded a net expense for income taxes for fiscal of million  which includes a full valuation allowance provided against our net deferred tax assets of million 
net loss was per share  or million for fiscal  compared to net income of per fully diluted share  or million  for fiscal the decrease in operating results of million to million of income from operations in fiscal was primarily the result of a basis point increase in selling  general  and administrative expense expressed as a percentage of revenue  offset by a basis point improvement in cost of revenue and occupancy expressed as a percentage of revenue 

table of contents net revenue increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which largely resulted from a million  or  increase in our direct to customer net revenue  and a million  or  increase in revenue generated from our retail segment 
the increase in net revenue in both our retail and direct channels can also be attributed to our focus on growing our catalog page count  as the catalog is our primary advertising vehicle 
comparable store sales for fiscal decreased  or million  compared to fiscal net revenue related to our outlet stores and warehouse sales events was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the cost of revenue and occupancy increased by million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily in support of our revenue growth 
the basis point expansion of our gross margin to in fiscal from in fiscal was attributable to continued improvements in our product margin of basis points  a basis point improvement in supply chain and distribution costs  and a basis point improvement in occupancy costs as a percentage of net revenue 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million  or  in fiscal over fiscal as a percent of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense increased to of net revenue in fiscal from in fiscal this included the million non cash charge for the acceleration of depreciation of certain fixtures removed as part of the store remodeling effort  and expressed as a percentage of revenue  was higher than fiscal we also recorded a million impairment charge on the long lived assets of two underperforming stores 
the increase of basis points was driven primarily by a combination of higher catalog circulation costs expressed as a percent of revenue of basis points  increased occupancy and related costs of basis points  increased direct to customer call center and fulfillment costs of basis points  increased other variable costs of basis points  and a basis point increase for the non cash charge associated with the store remodeling efforts 
interest expense increased by million in fiscal due to higher average debt levels and higher average interest rates during fiscal compared to fiscal we recorded an income tax expense for fiscal of million on a pre tax loss of million which included a fourth quarter non cash charge of million to provide a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we concluded  under the guidance provided in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  that our cumulative losses through and our three year cumulative loss through necessitated providing a valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets as of january  under generally accepted accounting principles  when our results demonstrate a pattern of future profitability  in reversal of the current cumulative loss trend  this valuation allowance may be adjusted and may result in the reinstatement of all or a part of the net deferred tax assets 
this fiscal adjustment has had  and will continue to have no impact on our cash flow or future prospects  nor does it alter our ability to utilize the underlying tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the future the utilization of which is limited to achieving future taxable income 
our business is highly seasonal  which reflects a general pattern in the retail industry wherein the highest sales and earnings occur during the holiday season 
historically  a significant percentage of our sales have occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter 
in our peak holiday selling season  we incur significant additional expenses in connection with  among other things  the hiring of additional seasonal employees in our retail stores and the production and mailing of a higher volume of our catalogs

this increase was primarily due to a basis point improvement in selling  general and administrative expense partially offset by an basis point decrease in our gross margin 
the basis point improvement in selling  general and administrative expenses was due to a decrease in store employment and other store variable costs of basis points  a decrease in advertising costs of basis points and the absence of basis points related to the million prior year non cash charge for accelerated depreciation of certain store fixtures associated with our remodeling efforts

direct to customer net revenue for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal fiscal revenue growth in the direct to customer channel was driven by increases in page count in our core catalog  the increase in circulation from the launches of the restoration hardware outdoor catalog and the restoration hardware gift catalog  and strong customer response to our spring  outdoor and summer offerings 
for fiscal  the number of catalogs mailed increased by with a increase in pages circulated 
internet sales grew in fiscal to million and catalog sales grew in fiscal to million 

table of contents income from operations for the direct to customer segment was million  or of net direct revenue  in fiscal as compared to million  or of net direct revenue  in the prior fiscal year 
the increase in income from operations for the direct to customer segment was primarily due to a basis point improvement in gross margin which resulted from a basis point reduction in supply chain and distribution costs  partially offset by a basis point decline in product margin 
direct to customer segment selling  general and administrative costs remained relatively constant  improving basis points between fiscal and fiscal income from operations for the direct to customer segment reflects the results associated with catalog and internet sales  less direct management costs 
direct to customer net revenue for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to fiscal this increase was attributable to an expansion of the merchandise offerings in both the catalog and on the internet  as well as a continued focus on increasing catalog and internet only merchandise which drives improved response rates and catalog productivity 
for fiscal  income from operations for the direct segment increased to million  or of segment net revenue  as compared to million  or of segment net revenue  for fiscal this increase of million  or  represented a basis point improvement and was primarily the result of a basis point increase in gross margin due to a basis point improvement in supply chain and distribution costs and a basis point improvement in product margin 
this is offset by a basis point increase in selling  general and administrative expense from higher payroll costs of basis points  call center and fulfillment costs of basis points  higher catalog circulation costs of basis points  and higher other variable costs of basis points 
expenses cost of revenue and occupancy expense cost of revenue and occupancy expense increased by million  to million  in fiscal cost of revenue and occupancy expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue improved approximately basis points to in fiscal  from in fiscal this result was driven by a basis point improvement in our occupancy costs as a percentage of net revenues and by a basis point improvement in our product margins 
these improvements were partially offset by higher supply chain and distribution costs of basis points 
in fiscal  cost of revenue and occupancy expense expressed as a percentage of net revenue improved approximately basis points to  from in fiscal these improvements were attributable to a basis point increase in product margins  a basis point improvement in our supply chain and distribution costs and the decrease of relatively fixed store occupancy costs by basis points 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  to million  in fiscal expressed as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general  and administrative expense remained fairly constant at for fiscal compared to for fiscal the total dollar increase was primarily a function of the cost to support the net revenue increase in fiscal the basis point improvement in these costs  expressed as a percentage of net revenues  was due to a decrease in store employment and other store variable costs of basis points and the absence of the million non cash charge for accelerated depreciation of certain fixtures associated with remodeling efforts which increased prior year selling  general and administrative expense by basis points 
these improvements were partially offset by a basis point increase in advertising costs associated with the increased circulation from our catalogs and a basis point increase in costs due to our adoption of sfas r resulting in the recording of million of pre tax stock based compensation expense 
selling  general and administrative expense expressed in absolute dollars increased million  to million for fiscal from million in fiscal expressed as a percentage of net revenue  selling  general  and administrative expense increased to for fiscal from in fiscal the basis point increase in expense was driven by higher catalog circulation costs expressed as a percent of revenue of basis points  increased direct to customer call center and fulfillment costs as a percent of revenue of basis points  increased occupancy and related costs of basis points and basis points for the million non cash charge for accelerated depreciation of certain fixtures associated with remodeling efforts 
due to the expected growth of our direct to customer channel as a percentage of our total business mix  we believe that catalog circulation costs will continue to increase to support the growth  thus causing selling  general and administrative costs to continue deleveraging as a percentage of revenue in future quarters 
interest expense  net interest expense  net includes interest on borrowings under our revolving credit facility and amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest expense  net increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase resulted from higher average debt levels to support increased merchandise inventory for anticipated higher sales combined with increased interest rates during fiscal for fiscal  interest expense  net was million compared to million in fiscal of the million increase  approximately half was due to higher average debt levels and approximately half was due to higher average interest rates year over year 

table of contents income tax expense benefit our fiscal income tax expense was million on pre tax income of million 
this is a significant decline from fiscal s income tax expense of million on a pre tax loss of million 
the primary difference resulted from the recording of a million non cash charge in fiscal to establish a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
in fiscal  we also reversed the million valuation allowance associated with our wholly owned canadian subsidiary 
we believe that the deferred tax assets for canada are now realizable on a more likely than not basis and we have accordingly reversed this valuation allowance 
we recorded an income tax expense for fiscal of million on a pre tax loss of million  which included a full valuation allowance provided against our net deferred tax assets of million 
sfas requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
a review of all available positive and negative evidence must be considered in judging the likelihood of realizing tax benefits 
forming a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed can be difficult when there is negative evidence such as cumulative losses in recent years 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  it became evident that we would not meet our forecast of profitability in fiscal  and this lessened the weight that we could assign to future prospects for returning to consistent profitability 
that  combined with our history of losses through fiscal and cumulative losses for the last three years  represented sufficient negative evidence and it was difficult to overcome this with positive evidence under the evaluation guidance of sfas as a result of our assessment in applying sfas  we concluded that a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets was required as of january  the effect was to include a non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal this adjustment has had  and will continue to have no impact on our cash flow or future prospects  nor does it alter our ability to utilize the underlying tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the future  the utilization of which is limited to achieving future taxable income 
as of february   we had net deferred tax assets of million reflecting net deferred tax assets totaling million  which primarily represented the income tax benefit associated with losses reported in prior years and differences in fixed asset bases offset by a valuation allowance of million 
these losses are subject to federal and state carry forward provisions of up to years

liquidity and capital resources fiscal year dollars in thousands net cash used provided by operating activities net cash used by investing activities net cash provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents operating cash flows for fiscal  net cash used by operating activities was million compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the decrease in net cash used by operating activities was a result of an increase in net earnings plus non cash expenses for depreciation  amortization  stock based compensation  net loss on disposal of property and equipment  and deferred income taxes of million  an increase in merchandise inventories of million  a decrease in prepaid expenses and other assets of million and an increase in accounts payables and accrued expenses of million 
the increase of million in merchandise inventories during fiscal resulted from the effect of changes in inventory due to planned sales growth requirements related to our direct to customer segment growth and increase in outlet stores 
during fiscal we made targeted inventory investments in product categories where we believe we have opportunities to drive higher revenue growth through improving our in stock positions in both our retail and direct to customer segments 
the decrease in accounts payables and accrued expenses of million was in support of increased merchandise inventory for anticipated higher sales 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million of net cash used by operating activities for fiscal net cash provided by operating activities reflects the effect of the million non cash charge for establishing a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets 
the majority of the increase in net cash provided in fiscal compared to net cash used in fiscal results from the smaller increases in inventory and accounts payable in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase in inventory in fiscal of is consistent with the higher sales recorded in the period and does not reflect the same timing of inventory receipts at year end as occurred in the prior year 

table of contents investing cash flows net cash used by investing activities decreased to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal this decrease primarily related to a reduction in capital expenditure during fiscal capital expenditures during fiscal included the remodeling of the majority of our retail stores  the opening of one retail and five outlet stores  and facility improvements to our distribution sites 
net cash used by investing activities was million for fiscal  an increase of million compared to million for fiscal the cash used for investing activities for fiscal primarily related to the million expenditure for the remodeling of the majority of our retail stores  the opening of one retail and five outlet stores  and facility improvements to our distribution sites 
financing cash flows net cash provided by financing activities decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease in current year financing activities primarily resulted from the million decrease in net borrowings received under our revolving credit facility  net of debt issuance costs during fiscal compared to fiscal  partially offset by a million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal was million  compared to million for fiscal the million increase in cash provided by financing activities for fiscal primarily related to a million increase in borrowings under our revolving credit facility  net of debt issuance costs and a million increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
we currently have in place a million revolving credit facility  the maturity date of which was extended from june  to june  under an amendment to the facility that we entered into on june  the amendment 
the availability of credit at any given time under the revolving credit facility is limited by reference to a borrowing base formula which includes an adjustment to the advance rate against eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivables for incremental advances as described below based upon numerous factors  including the value of eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivable  and reserves established by the agent of the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility also provides for incremental advances with availability determined from the application of a higher advance rate on eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivables constituting part of our borrowing base 
in order to obtain these incremental advances  we are required to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio if the remaining availability for additional borrowing under the facility is less than of the applicable borrowing base for the line of credit at the time 
the incremental advances would be subject to higher interest rates 
the revolving credit facility is secured by our assets  including accounts receivable  inventory  general intangibles  equipment  goods and fixtures 
as of february   million was outstanding under the facility  net of unamortized debt issuance costs of million  and there was million in outstanding letters of credit 
as a result of the amendment  the balance of million at february  is considered a long term liability rather than a current liability and has been classified accordingly 
borrowings made under the revolving credit facility are subject to interest at either the bank s reference rate or libor plus a margin 
as of february   the bank s reference rate was and the libor plus margin rate was 
borrowings that are incremental advances under the revolving credit facility are subject to interest at the bank s reference rate plus a margin or libor plus a higher margin 
the availability of credit at any given time under the revolving credit facility is limited by reference to a borrowing base formula which includes an adjustment to the advance rate against eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivables for incremental advances as described above based upon numerous factors  including the value of eligible inventory and eligible accounts receivable  and reserves established by the agent of the revolving credit facility 
as a result of the borrowing base formula  the actual borrowing availability under the facility could be less than the stated amount of the facility reduced by the actual borrowings and outstanding letters of credit 
as of february   we had availability under the facility of million 
the revolving credit facility contains various restrictive covenants  including limitations on the ability to make liens  make investments  sell assets  incur additional debt  merge  consolidate or acquire other businesses  pay dividends or other distributions  and enter into transactions with affiliates 
the revolving credit facility does not contain any other significant financial or coverage ratio covenants unless the company takes advantage of the incremental advance provision 
if we receive an advance under the incremental 
table of contents advance provision and if the remaining availability for additional borrowing under the facility is less than of the applicable borrowing base for the line of credit at the time  the company is required to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio 
the revolving credit facility also does not require that we repay all borrowings for a prescribed clean up period each year 
our revolving credit facility does not require a daily sweep lockbox arrangement except upon the occurrence of an event of default under the facility or in the event the remaining availability for additional borrowings under the facility is less than a certain amount 
we currently believe that our cash flows from operations and funds available under our revolving credit facility will satisfy our expected working capital and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  the weakening of  or other adverse developments concerning  our sales performance or adverse developments concerning the availability of credit under our revolving credit facility due to covenant limitations or other factors could limit the overall availability of funds to us 
we may not have successfully anticipated our future capital needs or the timing of such needs and we may need to raise additional funds in order to take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we also may need to raise additional funds to respond to changing business conditions or unanticipated competitive pressures 
however  should the need arise  additional sources of financing may not be available or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we fail to raise sufficient funds  we may be required to delay or abandon some of our planned future expenditures or aspects of our current operations 
for more information  please refer to the risk factors included in item a  risk factors  entitled we are dependent on external funding sources  including the terms of our revolving credit facility  which may not make available to us sufficient funds when we need them and because our business requires a substantial level of liquidity  we are dependent upon a revolving credit facility with certain restrictive covenants that limit our flexibility 
we are currently negotiating with the bank under our credit facility to amend the facility by increasing the amount available under the facility and by changing certain pricing and other terms 
we currently anticipate entering into a definitive amendment to the facility in the second quarter of fiscal the additional amount that would be available under the facility would support our growth initiatives and the capital investments we are making to improve certain operational systems and processes

on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales returns  inventories  goodwill  income taxes  financing operations  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other facts and assumptions  including current and expected economic conditions and product mix  that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our management believes the following critical accounting policies require significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements sales returns reserve we provide an allowance for sales returns based on historical return rates which generally considers both the level of merchandise returns and the time elapsed from the date of sale to the date of the return 
this reserve is booked on a gross basis  reducing both total sales and cost of sales each period 
should actual return rate levels increase by in fiscal or the customer return time lengthen by in fiscal  our results would be negatively impacted by approximately million 
at february  and january   the allowance for sales returns was approximately million and million  respectively 
merchandise inventories our retail inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method 
manufacturing inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined at standard costs  approximating average costs 
costs include certain buying and distribution costs  including payroll and other costs related to the purchase of inventory 
we write down inventories whenever markdowns reduce the selling price below cost 
additionally  we provide for monthly reserves on inventory based upon our estimate of shrinkage losses 
actual shrinkage is recorded based on the results of our physical inventory counts 
we also write down our slow moving and discontinued inventory to its estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if liquidation of the inventory is more difficult than anticipated  additional inventory write downs may be required 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived tangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
using our best estimates based on reasonable assumptions and projections  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values if the carrying values of such assets exceed their related discounted expected future cash flows 
we review goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite useful lives for impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances warrant 
if the carrying values of such assets exceed their estimated fair values  we record an impairment loss to write the assets down to their estimated fair values 
we generally evaluate long lived tangible assets at an individual store level  which is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified 
we evaluate corporate assets or other long lived assets that are not store specific at a consolidated entity or reporting unit level  as appropriate 
since there is typically no active market for our long lived tangible and intangible assets  we estimate fair values based on the expected future cash flows 
we estimate future cash flows based on store level historical results  current trends and operating and cash flow projections 
our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty and may be affected by a number of factors outside our control  including general economic conditions  the competitive environment and regulatory changes 
if actual results differ from our estimates of future cash flows  we may record significant additional impairment charges in the future 
no impairment charges were recorded in fiscal 
table of contents self insurance we obtain insurance coverage for significant exposures as well as those risks that  by law  must be insured 
it is generally our policy to retain a significant portion of certain losses related to workers compensation  general liability  property losses  business interruption and employee health care 
we record provisions for these items based on an actuary report  claims experience  regulatory changes  an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported and other relevant factors 
the projections involved in this process are subject to substantial uncertainty because of several unpredictable factors  including actual future claims experience  regulatory changes  litigation trends and changes in inflation 
should the amount of claims be more or less than what we estimated or should the costs of claims increase or decrease beyond what we anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly in future periods 
at february  and january   we had accrual balances for these liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
income taxes and valuation allowance we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
sfas requires income taxes to be accounted for under an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our company s consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
in estimating future tax consequences  we generally take into account all expected future events then known to us  other than changes in the tax law or rates  which are not permitted to be considered 
accordingly  if needed we may record a valuation allowance to reduce net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the amount of valuation allowance would be based upon management s best estimate of the recoverability of the net deferred tax assets 
while future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning are considered in determining the amount of the valuation allowance  the necessity for an allowance is subject to adjustment in the future 
specifically  in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize the net deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amounts  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would decrease income in the period such determination was made 
this allowance does not alter our ability to utilize the underlying tax net operating loss and credit carryforwards in the future  the utilization of which is limited to achieving future taxable income 
we recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets during fiscal however  in fiscal  we reversed the million valuation allowance associated with our wholly owned canadian subsidiary 
we believe that the deferred tax assets for canada are now realizable on a more likely than not basis and we have accordingly reversed this valuation allowance 
other considerations the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto in this annual report on form k  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb ratified the consensuses reached by the emerging issues task force eitf in issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
issue no 
requires disclosure of an entity s accounting policy regarding the presentation of taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on a revenue producing transaction between a seller and a customer including sales  use  value added and some excise taxes 
we present such taxes on a net basis excluded from revenues and costs 
the adoption of issue no 
 which is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken in a tax return 
the company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we expect to adopt the provisions of fin beginning from the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the effect of adopting fin on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  effective for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the company does not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on the company s operating results or financial position 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  foreign exchange rates 
we do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is  therefore  affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt rose more than from the bank s reference rate  our results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
although we do enter into a significant amount of purchase obligations outside of the united states of america  to date these obligations have been settled mostly in us dollars and  therefore  we believe we have only minimal exposure at present to foreign currency exchange risks 
historically  we have not hedged our currency risk and do not currently anticipate doing so in the future 
however  it is possible that in the future a growing number of our purchases outside of the united states of america will be made in currencies other than the us dollar 
consequently  fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the us dollar and other currencies may subject us to foreign currency exchange risks in the future
