factors that have contributed to the decline in the investment periodicals and related publications revenues include the increasing amount of competition in the form of free and paid investment research on the internet and research provided by brokerage firms at no cost to their clients 
within investment periodicals and related publications are subscription revenues to print and electronic products 
year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs print publication revenues electronic publication revenues total investment periodicals and related publications revenue unearned revenues short and long term value line s electronic publications revenues are derived from institutional and retail subscribers 
for the year ended april   institutional revenues increased  or  while revenues from retail subscribers were down  or 
the decrease in electronic retail publications revenues is attributable to the decrease in circulation within the company s software products 
licensing revenues licensing fee revenues have grown   and  respectively each of the last three years ended april    and as of april   total third party sponsored assets attributable to the licensing business represent billion in various products 
the company believes the growth of the business is dependent upon the desire of third party marketers to use the value line trademarks and proprietary research for their products  signing new licensing agreements  and the marketplace s acceptance of new products 
while assets and revenues grew in fiscal year and in fiscal year  the company did not sign any new agreements with sponsors in fiscal year it did however expand existing relationships with additional third party products offered 
value line believes it was an early entrant into this new market five years ago and today the market has matured and the company and its third party sponsors face more competition in the marketplace

beginning november  vls suspended its business of executing trades for any of the value line funds  from which it had earned net commission revenues 
due to increased net assets  higher investment management fees mostly offset the decline in net commission revenues for fiscal the table below illustrates the total fund assets for years ended april    and the second table shows the two channels the equity funds are available

the largest distribution channel for the value line funds remains the fund supermarket platforms such as schwab  ameritrade  and national city bank 
expenses advertising and promotion year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs advertising and promotion advertising and promotion for the year ended april  increased  from fiscal year the primary increase is within the fees paid to third party intermediaries  such as schwab to market the value line funds 
this expense will fluctuate based on assets invested in the value line funds by clients of the intermediaries  the change in market value of such assets  and the addition of any new intermediary selling agreements 
the company anticipates third party intermediary expenses will continue to increase as assets continue to grow 
costs associated with direct mail remained substantially the same  while the overall number of pieces mailed increased year to year 
the company also increased its expenditures in print media promoting the value line funds and the value line investment survey in separate campaigns in select markets 
for the year ended april  as compared to april   advertising expenses decreased  primarily from the reduction in media advertising and the frequency of marketing campaigns and fewer pieces having been mailed in fiscal year for the company s investment periodicals 
salary and employee benefits year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs salaries and employee benefits the company employed employees at year end april   as compared to at year end april  and at year end april  the company has increased productivity by the combination of roles and responsibilities along with selective outsourcing 
some duplication of effort has been eliminated and certain tasks  such as data entry  have been outsourced to third party vendors that the company believes can provide better controls and faster results at a favorable cost 
production and distribution year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs production and distribution production and distribution expenses for the fiscal year ended april  were  below expenses for fiscal production and distribution expenses for the fiscal year ended april  were  below expenses for fiscal the decline in expenses was primarily due to lower demand for paper  printing and mailing costs that resulted primarily from a decrease in circulation of the print products 
partially offsetting the savings in fiscal was an increase in the cost of paper and an increase in postage rates 
office and administration year ended april  percentage change in thousands vs vs office and administration office and administration expenses for the fiscal year ended april  were  below expenses for fiscal office and administration expenses for the fiscal year ended april  were  above expenses for fiscal in fiscal professional fees significantly decreased from fiscal professional fees can fluctuate year to year based on the level of activity requiring the use of outside professional consultants 
within occupancy  during the last fiscal quarter of fiscal  the company extended its lease in midtown new york extending the lease expiration date to may on negotiated terms in place of the company s renewal option at market rate  which resulted in significantly higher rent as a result of market conditions 
the increase in office and administrative expenses for fiscal was primarily due to an increase in professional fees and the additional ongoing costs associated with outsourcing certain of the mutual fund administration functions 
income from securities transactions  net for the year ended april   the company s income from securities transactions  net  is  higher than the year ended april  income from securities transactions  net  includes dividend and interest income that is  higher than the previous year due to an increase in interest rates

for fiscal year  cash flow from operations was lower than fiscal s cash flow of  the decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily due to the liquidation of the company s trading securities portfolio in fiscal year in anticipation of the special dividend 
cash from investing activities the company s cash outflow from investing activities of  for the twelve months ended april  was  below the cash in flow from investing activities for the twelve months ended april  due to the purchase of fixed income securities during the year 
net cash inflows of  from investing activities during the twelve months of fiscal compared to net cash outflows of  during fiscal  which primarily resulted from purchases of fixed income securities in fiscal cash from financing activities the company s net cash outflow from financing activities of  for the twelve months ended april  increased from fiscal due to the payment of a higher quarterly dividend of for the final three quarters of fiscal as compared to for each quarter in fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal cash outflows from financing activities for fiscal year of  reflect the company s quarterly dividends of 
per share for each quarter as well as a special dividend paid to all shareholders on may  management believes that the company s cash and other liquid asset resources used in its business together with the future cash flows from operations will be sufficient to finance current and forecasted operations 
management did not borrow in fiscal or fiscal and does not anticipate any borrowing in fiscal critical accounting estimates and policies the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent and the company evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition income taxes revenue recognition the majority of the company s revenues come from the sale of print and electronic subscriptions  investment management and service and distribution fees  and licensing proprietary information 
the company recognizes subscription revenue in equal amounts over the term of the subscription  which generally ranges from three months to three years  varying based on the product or service 
investment management fees and service and distribution fee revenues for the value line funds are recognized each month based upon the daily net assets of each fund 
licensing fees are calculated monthly based on market fluctuation and billed quarterly 
the company believes that the estimates related to revenue recognition are critical accounting estimates  and to the extent that there are material differences between its determination of revenues and actual results  its financial condition or results of operations may be affected 
income taxes the company s effective annual income tax expense rate is based on the us federal and state and local jurisdiction tax rates on income and losses that are part of our consolidated financial statements 
tax planning opportunities and the blend of business income and income from securities transactions will impact the effective tax rate in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions 
tax law requires items to be included in the tax return at different times from when these items are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different from the tax rate reported on the company s tax return the company s cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as non taxable income that is not includable in the company s tax return and expenses that are not deductible in the company s tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation and amortization expenses 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
as of april   the company had million of deferred tax liabilities and  of short term deferred tax assets 
in assessing the company s deferred tax assets  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company considers both positive and negative evidence  including tax planning strategies  projected future taxable income  and recent financial performance 
if after future assessments of the realizability of the deferred tax assets the company determines a lesser allowance is required  the company would record a reduction to the income tax expense and to the valuation allowance in the period this determination was made 
this would cause the company s income tax expense  effective tax rate  and net income to fluctuate 
in addition  the company establishes reserves at the time that it determines that it is more likely than not that it will need to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
the company adjusts these reserves  including any impact of the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which the company has established a reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter  the company records a reserve when it determines the likelihood of loss is more likely than not 
such liabilities are recorded as income taxes payable in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
favorable resolutions of tax matters for which the company has previously established reserves are recognized as a reduction to the company s income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns requires judgment 
variations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has no off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations below is a summary of certain contractual obligations in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term obligations reflected on balance sheet total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures the company s consolidated balance sheet includes a substantial amount of assets whose fair values are subject to market risks 
the company s significant market risks are primarily associated with interest rates and equity prices 
the following sections address the significant market risks associated with the company s business activities 
interest rate risk the company s strategy has been to acquire highly liquid debt securities with extremely low credit risk 
despite this strategy management recognizes and accepts the possibility that losses may occur 
to limit the price fluctuation in these securities from interest rate changes  the company s management invests primarily in short term obligations maturing in to years 
the fair values of the company s fixed maturity investments will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates 
increases and decreases in prevailing interest rates generally translate into decreases and increases in fair values of those instruments 
additionally  fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by prepayment options  relative values of alternative investments  and other general market conditions 
the following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical increases and decreases in interest rates on assets that are subject to interest rate risk 
it is assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
the hypothetical changes in market interest rates do not reflect what could be deemed best or worst case scenarios 
variations in market interest rates could produce significant changes in the timing of repayments due to prepayment options available 
for these reasons  actual results might differ from those reflected in the table

equity price risk the carrying values of investments subject to equity price risks are based on quoted market prices or management s estimates of fair value as of the balance sheet dates 
market prices are subject to fluctuation and  consequently  the amount realized in the subsequent sale of an investment may significantly differ from the reported market value 
fluctuation in the market price of a security may result from perceived changes in the underlying economic characteristics of the issuer  the relative price of alternative investments and general market conditions 
furthermore  amounts realized in the sale of a particular security may be affected by the relative quantity of the security being sold 
value line invests a significant level of its assets in equity securities  primarily the value line funds 
each mutual fund invests in a variety of equity positions
