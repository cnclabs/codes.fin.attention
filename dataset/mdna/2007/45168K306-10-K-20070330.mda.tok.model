item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are engaged in the discovery and development of synthetic dna and rna based compounds for the treatment of cancer  infectious diseases  autoimmune diseases  and asthma allergies  and for use as vaccine adjuvants 
we have designed proprietary product candidates to modulate immune responses through toll like receptors  or tlrs 
tlrs are specific receptors present in immune system cells that direct the immune system to respond to potential disease threats 
relying on our expertise in dna and rna chemistry  we are identifying product candidates targeted to tlrs  or for our internal development programs and for collaborative alliances 
we are developing both agonists and antagonists of tlrs  and we have three internal programs  in oncology  infectious diseases  and autoimmune diseases  and two collaborative alliances relating to the development of treatments for asthma and allergies and the development of adjuvants for vaccines 
our most advanced product candidate  imo  is an agonist of tlr we are currently conducting a phase trial of imo in oncology and a phase trial of imo in combination with chemotherapy in oncology 
we have selected a second tlr agonist  imo  as a lead product candidate for treating infectious diseases and plan to submit an investigational new drug application  or ind  to the us food and drug administration  or fda  for this product candidate in the second quarter of in our autoimmune disease program  which is in earlier stages of research  we are evaluating tlr antagonists in preclinical models 
we are collaborating with novartis international pharmaceutical  ltd  or novartis  for the discovery  development  and commercialization of tlr agonists for the treatment of asthma allergy indications 
we also are collaborating with merck co  inc  or merck  for the use of our tlr  and agonists in combination with merck s therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines in the areas of oncology  infectious diseases  and alzheimer s disease 
at december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur substantial operating losses in the future and do not expect to generate significant funds internally until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for products  either alone or in collaborations with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in order to commercialize our therapeutic products  we need to address a number of technological challenges and to comply with comprehensive regulatory requirements 
in  we expect that our research and development expenses will be higher than our research and development expenses in as we commence new clinical trials of imo and  subject to filing an ind and the ind becoming effective  begin clinical trials of imo critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where i the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and ii the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to our financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant policies  however  fit the definition of critical accounting estimates 
we believe that our accounting policies relating to revenue recognition and stock based compensation fit the description of critical accounting estimates 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission  or sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 or sab  that requires four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  services have been rendered or obligations have been satisfied  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of the last three criteria are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered or products delivered and the collectibility of these fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for any future transactions  revenues recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
when evaluating multiple element arrangements  the company considers whether the components of the arrangement represent separate units of accounting as defined in emerging issues task force issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize license fees and other upfront fees  not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  ratably over the term of our contractual obligation or our estimated continuing involvement under the research arrangement 
we recognize service and research and development revenue when the services are performed 
for payments that are specifically associated with a separate earnings process  we recognize revenue when the specific performance obligation is completed 
performance obligations typically consist of significant milestones in the development life cycle of the related technology  such as initiating clinical trials  filing for approval with regulatory agencies and obtaining approvals from regulatory agencies 
stock based compensation we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  on january  this statement requires us to recognize all share based payments to employees as expense in the financial statements based on their fair values 
under sfas no 
r  we are required to record compensation expense over an award s vesting period based on the award s fair value at the date of grant 
we elected to adopt sfas no 
r on a modified prospective basis 
as a result  the financial statements for periods prior to january   do not include compensation cost calculated under the fair value method 
our policy is to charge the fair value of stock options as an expense on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
prior to january   we applied accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and therefore  recorded the intrinsic value of stock based compensation as an expense

results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues decreased slightly by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by million  or  from million in to million in the decrease in revenue in primarily reflects the inclusion in of revenues related to a reimbursement of third party expenses in under our collaboration agreement with novartis 
this decrease is partially offset by million representing a full year of license fee revenue recognized in under the same collaboration with novartis and license fee revenue recognized under our collaboration agreement with merck signed in december in december  we received a million upfront payment under our collaboration agreement with merck 
we are recognizing the million upfront payment over the potential research term under the agreement 
of this million  we recognized million as revenue in with the balance recorded in deferred revenue at december  revenue increased in from primarily due to the license fees and reimbursed third party expenses recognized under our collaboration agreement with novartis entered into in may in july  we received from novartis a million upfront fee under the novartis agreement 
of this million  we recognized million as revenue in with the balance being recorded in deferred revenue at december  and amortized over the expected research term 
our revenues for  and were comprised of payments under various collaboration and licensing agreements for research and development  including reimbursement of third party expenses  and license fees  sublicense fees  and royalty payments 
revenue for also included a milestone payment 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the increase in research and development expenses from to was primarily due to increased costs associated with imo preclinical studies in infectious disease  higher payroll costs  an increase in stock based compensation and costs associated with the formation of our oncology clinical advisory board 
these increased expenses were offset  in part  by third party expenses incurred by us in related to the novartis collaboration  which were not incurred in the increase in was primarily attributable to patient and management costs associated with our phase clinical trial of imo  studies leading to the selection of 
table of contents imo as a lead compound  and manufacturing of imo the year also included third party costs associated with our novartis collaboration 
year ended december  annual percentage change in thousands imo external development expenses other drug development expenses basic discovery expenses total research and development expenses patent related costs were previously included in research and development expenses but have been reclassified to general and administrative expenses for all periods displayed above 
in the preceding table  research and development expense is set forth in the following three categories imo external development expenses 
these expenses include external expenses that we have incurred in connection with imo  our lead compound being developed for oncology applications 
these external expenses reflect payments to independent contractors and vendors for drug development trials and studies conducted after the initiation of imo clinical trials and drug manufacturing and related costs but exclude internal costs such as payroll and overhead 
since  when we commenced clinical development of imo  we have incurred approximately million in external expenses in connection with imo the decrease in imo expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to lower phase trial expenses as we approached full enrollment of our phase clinical trial and to a decrease in drug supply expenses as a result of the manufacture and expense recognition of imo during but not during these decreases were partially offset by an increase in the phase clinical trial  which we initiated in october  expenses and an increase in additional nonclinical safety studies of imo the increase in imo expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to expenses associated with our phase clinical trial  which began in october  and drug supply expenses as a result of the manufacture and expense recognition of imo during in october  we commenced patient recruitment for an open label  multi center phase clinical trial of imo as a monotherapy in patients with metastatic or recurrent clear cell renal cancer 
the trial is a two stage  multi center  open label study of imo under the protocol for the trial  we are seeking to enroll a total of up to patients in the first stage of the trial  who have failed one prior therapy and who have not received any prior therapy 
we plan to use the phase first stage data in the design of appropriate follow up trials 
we plan to present results from this on going trial when a complete set of data from the first stage becomes available after completion of treatment by all patients 
in october  we initiated a phase clinical trial of imo in combination with the chemotherapy agents gemcitabine and carboplatin 
we are seeking to enroll up to refractory solid tumor patients in the phase portion of the trial to evaluate the safety of the combination 
we expect to announce results of phase of this study by the end of other drug development expenses 
these expenses include internal and external expenses associated with preclinical development of identified compounds in anticipation of advancing these compounds into clinical development in addition to internal costs associated with products in clinical development 
the internal and external expenses associated with preclinical compounds include payments to contract vendors for manufacturing and the related stability studies  preclinical studies including animal toxicology and pharmacology studies and professional fees  as well as payroll and overhead 
the internal expenses associated with products in clinical development include costs associated with our oncology clinical advisory board  payroll and overhead 
for the years ended december  and  we had direct external expenses of approximately million and million  respectively relating to imo we had no direct external expenses in relating to imo the increase in these expenses in was primarily attributable to manufacturing and 
table of contents ind enabling safety study costs associated with imo  costs associated with the formation of our oncology clinical advisory board and an increase in compensation costs attributable to the hiring of additional employees and our adoption of sfas no 
r 
these increases were offset  in part by third party expenses incurred by us in related to the novartis collaboration  which were not incurred in the increase in these expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to third party costs associated with our novartis collaboration and the manufacture of imo this increase was partially offset by a decrease in compensation primarily attributable to the retirement of one of our officers in early basic discovery expenses 
these expenses include our internal and external expenses relating to the continuing discovery and development of our tlr targeted programs  including agonists and antagonists of tlrs  and these expenses reflect payments for laboratory supplies  external research  and professional fees  as well as payroll and overhead 
the decrease in these expenses in compared to was primarily attributable to a decrease in external research as some of our collaborative agreements with academic institutions were completed 
the decrease was also attributable to a decrease in compensation expense as a result of allocating more executive compensation to other departments  offset partially by an increase in compensation costs attributable  in part  to our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the decrease in expenses was partially offset by an increase in allocation of overhead costs as a result of higher facility expenses 
the increase in as compared to was primarily attributable to a credit recorded to stock compensation in as a result of a decrease in the intrinsic value of the options that had been repriced and marked to market and to higher payroll expenses in we do not know if we will be successful in developing imo or any of our other product candidates 
at this time  without knowing the results of our ongoing clinical trials of imo and without an established plan for future clinical tests of imo  we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts that will be necessary to complete the remainder of the development of  or the period  if any  in which material net cash inflows may commence from  imo moreover  the clinical development of imo or any of our other product candidates is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties associated with the duration and cost of clinical trials  which vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of unanticipated events arising during clinical development  including with respect to the number of clinical sites included in the trials  the length of time required to enroll suitable subjects  the number of subjects that ultimately participate in the trials  and the efficacy and safety results of our clinical trials and the number of additional required clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and decreased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in general and administrative expenses consisted primarily of salary expense  stock compensation expense  consulting fees and professional legal fees associated with our patent applications and maintenance  our regulatory filing requirements  and business development 
the million increase from to primarily reflects an increase in compensation expenses associated with the addition of employees in  higher compensation levels in  and higher stock compensation expenses resulting from our adoption of sfas no 
r 
the increase also reflects higher consulting and legal expenses as a result of the merck collaboration signed in december these increases were partially offset by lower patent preparation costs resulting from a consolidation of our patent portfolio and greater efficiencies in maintaining our patents 
the primary reason for the million decrease in as compared to was a million charge resulting from the resignation of our former chief executive officer 
as a result of our lease of new headquarters which we expect to move into in june  our rent expense will increase significantly in and future years 

table of contents investment income  net investment income increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in and increased by approximately million  or  from million in to million in the increases for both periods is primarily attributable to higher interest rates 
interest expense interest expense increased by approximately  or  from  in to  in and increased by approximately  or  from  in to  in the increase in is due to the inclusion of a full year of interest and amortization of deferred financing costs associated with our notes in the aggregate principal amount of approximately million issued in may the notes were converted into shares of our common stock in february interest expense in is related to our notes that matured on april  upon the maturity of those notes  we paid million to the holders  representing the outstanding principal amount of our notes  plus accrued interest 
we expect that interest expense will decrease in as a result of our conversion of all of our notes into common stock in february income tax expense in  we recorded approximately  as income tax expense as a result of income subject to the alternative minimum tax or amt 
we did not have income subject to amt for the years ended and preferred stock dividends on december   shareholders approved amendments to our certificate of incorporation that reduced the liquidation preference of our series a convertible preferred stock from per share to per share  reduced the annual dividend on our series a convertible preferred stock from to  and increased the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of our series a convertible preferred stock by over the number of shares that would otherwise be issuable 
this special conversion extended for a day period between december  and february  inclusive 
during the day conversion period  the conversion ratio was increased such that the series a convertible preferred shareholders received approximately shares of common stock for each preferred share converted instead of the shares that they would normally have received 
during the conversion period holders of of the series a convertible preferred stock converted their preferred stock to common stock 
the series a convertible preferred stock dividends for each of the three years ended december  were as follows preferred stock dividends accretion of dividends expected to be paid on series a convertible preferred stock reversal of dividend accretion since preferred shares were converted in january and february and the dividends were not paid market value of additional shares issued upon conversion total preferred stock dividend as shown above  the value of the additional shares issued during the special preferred stock conversion periods is recorded as an addition to dividends in the statement of operations during of million 
as a result of the amendment to our certificate of incorporation and the series a convertible preferred stock conversions  the preferred stock liquidation preference was reduced from  at december  to  at december  and at february  
table of contents all preferred stock dividends are payable  at our election  either in cash or shares of series a convertible preferred stock 
we have paid all dividends in stock until when we elected to pay in cash 
net loss applicable to common stockholders as a result of the factors discussed above  our net loss applicable to common stockholders amounted to million for the year ended december   as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  we have incurred losses of million since january  we have incurred net losses of million prior to december  during which time we were involved in the development of antisense technology 
since our inception  we had an accumulated deficit of million through december  we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
net operating loss carryforwards as of december   we had cumulative net operating losses of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
the tax reform act of contains provisions that may limit our ability to utilize net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in any given year if certain events occur  including cumulative changes in ownership interests in excess of over a three year period 
we have completed several financings since the effective date of the tax act  which  as of december   have resulted in ownership changes  as defined under the tax act 
as a result our ability to utilize all of our available net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards in the future will be significantly limited 
we have not prepared an analysis to determine the effect of the ownership change limitation on our ability to utilize our net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we require cash to fund our operating expenses  to make capital expenditures and to pay debt service 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through the following equity and debt financing  license fees and research funding under collaborative and license agreements  interest income  and lease financings 
in december  we entered into an exclusive license and research collaboration agreement with merck to research  develop  and commercialize vaccine products containing our tlr  and agonists in the fields of oncology  infectious diseases and alzheimer s disease 
under the terms of the agreement  merck paid us a million license fee in december in addition  in connection with the execution of the license and collaboration agreement  we issued and sold to merck  shares of our common stock for a price of per share resulting in an aggregate purchase price of million 
in march  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds from a private placement to institutional investors 
in the private placement  we sold for a purchase price of per share  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the warrants have an exercise price of per share  are fully exercisable and will expire if not exercised on or prior to september  the warrants may be exercised by cash payment only 
the net proceeds to us from the offering  excluding the proceeds of any future exercise of the warrants  totaled approximately million 
in march  we secured a purchase commitment from an investor to purchase from us up to million of our common stock during the period from june  through december  in up to three drawdowns made by us at our discretion 
prior to december   we drew down the full million through the sale of  shares of common stock at a price of per share resulting in net proceeds to us  excluding the 
table of contents proceeds of any future exercise of the warrants  described below  of approximately million 
the agent fees and other costs directly related to securing the commitment amounted to approximately million 
as part of the arrangement  we issued warrants to the investor to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable by cash payment only 
the warrants are exercisable at any time on or prior to september  on or after march   we may redeem the warrants for per warrant share following notice to the warrant holders if the closing sales price of the common stock exceeds of the warrant exercise price for consecutive trading days prior to the notice 
we may exercise our right to redeem the warrants by providing at least days prior written notice to the holders of the warrants 
in may  we entered into a research collaboration and option agreement and a license  development and commercialization agreement with novartis to discover  develop and potentially commercialize immune modulatory oligonucleotides that are tlr agonists and that are identified as potential treatments for asthma and allergies 
under the terms of the agreements  novartis paid us a million license fee in july in february  novartis elected to extend the research phase of the collaboration by one year until may and  in connection with the extension  will pay us million 
in may  we issued approximately million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due april  to overseas investors 
interest on the convertible subordinated notes was payable in arrears on december  for the period from issuance to that date  and thereafter semi annually on april and october and at maturity or upon conversion 
we have the option to pay interest on the convertible subordinated notes in cash or in shares of common stock at the then current market value of the common stock 
in  we issued  shares of common stock in payment of interest on the convertible subordinated notes 
all other interest payments have been paid in cash 
the net proceeds from the offering totaled approximately million 
on february   we elected to automatically convert the convertible subordinated notes in the aggregate principal amount of million into  shares of our common stock effective on february  we were entitled to exercise the right of automatic conversion because the volume weighted average of the closing prices of the our common stock for the ten consecutive trading days ending february  exceeded  which represented of the conversion price of the notes 
in august  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds from a private placement to institutional and overseas investors 
in the private placement  we sold  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock 
the warrants to purchase common stock have an exercise price of per share and will expire if not exercised on or prior to august  the warrants may be exercised by cash payment only 
on or after february   we may redeem the warrants if the closing sales price of the common stock for each day of any consecutive trading day period is greater than or equal to per share 
the redemption price will be per share of common stock underlying the warrants 
we may exercise our right to redeem the warrants by providing days prior written notice to the holders of the warrants 
the net proceeds to us from the offering  excluding the proceeds of any future exercise of the warrants  totaled approximately million 
in april  we raised approximately million in gross proceeds through a registered direct offering 
in the offering  we sold  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to institutional and other investors 
the warrants to purchase common stock have an exercise price of per share and are exercisable on or prior to april  the warrants may be exercised by cash payment only 
we may redeem the warrants if the closing sales price of the common stock for each day of any consecutive trading day period ending within days prior to providing notice of redemption is greater than or equal to per share 
the redemption price will be per share of common stock underlying the warrants 
we may exercise our right to redeem the warrants by providing days prior written notice to the holders of the warrants 
the net proceeds to us from the offering  excluding the proceeds of any future exercise of the warrants  totaled approximately million 
cash flows as of december   we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents and investments  a net increase of approximately million from december  we generated million of cash from 
table of contents operating activities during the million primarily reflects a million increase in deferred revenue that is attributable to the receipt of the million upfront payment we received under our collaboration agreement with merck less the amortization of other license fees included in deferred revenue at december  this increase was offset by our million net loss for the period  as adjusted for non cash expenses  including depreciation  amortization and stock based compensation  and changes in our accounts receivable and payable 
the net cash used in investing activities during of million reflects our purchase of approximately million in securities offset by our sale of million of securities and the proceeds of approximately million from securities that matured in the net cash used in investing activities also reflects an increase in restricted cash to secure a line of credit for the security deposit of our new facility and our purchases of laboratory and computer equipment 
the net cash provided by financing activities during of million  reflects approximately million in gross proceeds that we received from the sale of common stock to merck under our agreement with merck  approximately million in gross proceeds that we received from the private placement to institutional investors in march  and approximately in gross proceeds from the sale of common stock under our march purchase commitment  offset by the expenses associated with both the march private placement and the purchase commitment 
the net cash provided by financing activities also reflects approximately million in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options during funding requirements we have incurred operating losses in all fiscal years except and had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through december  we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in future periods 
these losses  among other things  have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders equity  total assets and working capital 
we have received no revenues from the sale of drugs 
to date  almost all of our revenues have been from collaborative and license agreements 
we have devoted substantially all of our efforts to research and development  including clinical trials  and we have not completed development of any drugs 
because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses  whether or when any of our products will become commercially available  or when we will become profitable  if at all 
we do not expect to generate significant additional funds internally until we successfully complete development and obtain marketing approval for products  either alone or in collaboration with third parties  which we expect will take a number of years 
in addition  we have no committed external sources of funds 
should we be unable to raise sufficient funds in the future  we may be required to significantly curtail our operating plans and possibly relinquish rights to portions of our technology or products 
in addition  increases in expenses or delays in clinical development may adversely impact our cash position and require further cost reductions 
no assurance can be given that we will be able to operate profitably on a consistent basis  or at all  in the future 
we believe that the key factors that will affect our internal and external sources of cash are the success of our clinical and preclinical development programs  the success of our existing strategic collaborations with novartis and merck  the cost  timing and outcome of regulatory reviews  the receptivity of the capital markets to financings by biotechnology companies  and our ability to enter into new strategic collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and the success of such collaborations 
additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or may not be available to us on favorable terms 
we could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others that may require us to 
table of contents relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or drugs that we would otherwise pursue on our own 
in addition  if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our then existing stockholders will experience dilution 
debt financing  if available  may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions  such as incurring additional debt  making capital expenditures or declaring dividends  and are likely to include rights that are senior to the holders of our common stock 
any additional debt financing or equity that we raise may contain terms  such as liquidation and other preferences  or liens or other restrictions on our assets  which are not favorable to us or our stockholders 
the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of existing stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funding on a timely basis or at all  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our discovery or development programs 
for example  we significantly curtailed expenditures on our research and development programs during and because we did not have sufficient funds available to advance these programs at planned levels 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual commitments were as follows payments due by period less than contractual obligations total year years years after years operating lease commitments capital lease commitments convertible notes payable total our only material lease commitment relates to our new facility in cambridge  massachusetts 
under our license agreements  we are obligated to make milestone payments upon achieving specified milestones and to pay royalties to our licensors 
these contingent milestone and royalty payment obligations are not included in the above table 
in july  we signed an agreement with a contract research organization  or cro  to manage the phase clinical trial of imo in patients with renal cell cancer 
under the agreement and a subsequent change in scope  we may pay the cro up to million in connection with this trial 
as of december   we have paid approximately million to the cro under the agreement 
in may  we sold approximately million in principal amount of convertible subordinated notes due april  in february  we converted all of the notes into  shares of our common stock
