item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the historical consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
general the company s principal business is media including publishing newspapers both in print and online in the united states of america  and its publications are primarily daily and non daily newspapers and web sites 
the company s revenues are derived primarily from advertising  paid circulation and commercial printing 
as of december   the company owned and operated daily newspapers and non daily publications strategically clustered in seven geographic areas greater philadelphia  michigan  connecticut  the greater cleveland area of ohio  central new england  and the capital saratoga and mid hudson regions of new york 
the company owns jobsintheus  a network of employment web sites in the united states of america 
the company has total paid daily circulation of approximately  total paid sunday circulation of approximately  and total non daily distribution of approximately million 
the company s revenues are derived from advertising  paid circulation  including single copy sales and subscription sales  and commercial printing and other activities 
the company s advertiser base is predominantly local 
the company s newspapers and web sites seek to produce desirable results for local advertisers by targeting readers based on certain geographic and demographic characteristics 
the company seeks to increase readership  and thereby generate traffic for its advertisers  by focusing on high product quality  compelling and primarily proprietary local content and creative and interactive promotions 
the company also publishes numerous special sections  as well as niche and special interest publicati ons 
such publications tend to increase readership within targeted demographic groups and geographic areas 
the company s management believes that as a result of these strategies  its newspapers represent an attractive and cost effective medium for its readers and advertisers 
the company promotes single copy sales of its newspapers because it believes that such sales have even higher readership than subscription sales  and that single copy readers tend to be more active consumers of goods and services 
single copy sales also tend to generate higher profit margins than subscription sales  as single copy sales generally have higher per unit prices and lower distribution costs 
subscription sales  which provide readers with the convenience of home delivery  are an important component of the company s circulation base 
the company s advertising revenues are derived primarily from a broad group of local advertisers 
no single advertiser accounted for more than one percent of the company s total fiscal year revenues 
the company s management believes that its advertising revenues tend to be relatively stable because its newspapers rely on a broad base of local retail and local classified advertising  rather than the generally more volatile national and major account advertising 
however  the company s advertising revenues are susceptible to economic swings  particularly those that affect the local economies in the markets in which the company operates  and can be difficult to predict 
in addition  the company is committed to expanding its business through its internet initiatives 
online revenues of million are included in advertising revenues for the fiscal year ended december  and constituted approximately four percent of total advertising revenues during the year 
the company s online objective is to make its web sites  all of which are accessible through www 
journalregister 
com  the local information portal for their respective markets by establishing such web sites as the indispensable source of useful and reliable community news  sports  information and advertising in their markets 
as of december   the company operated web sites  which are affiliated with the com pany s daily newspapers and non daily publications 
the company also publishes numerous special sections and niche and special interest publications 
such publications tend to increase readership within targeted demographic groups and geographic areas 
the company s management believes that as a result of these strategies  its newspapers represent an attractive and cost effective medium for its readers and advertisers 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  remaining useful lives of long lived assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  as well as contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and actuarial studies and on other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable and applicable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company re evaluates its estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to the company from normal business activities 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents reserves for the estimated loss from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the company uses historical experience as well as current market information in determining the estimate 
the company writes off accounts receivable  which are deemed uncollectible  on a specific identification basis 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
goodwill and other intangibles assets intangible assets recorded in connection with the acquisition of publications or businesses generally consist of the values assigned to subscriber lists  mastheads  non competition covenants and the excess of cost over the fair value of identifiable net assets of the publications or businesses acquired and deferred financing costs 
intangible assets  excluding goodwill and mastheads  are being amortized using the straight line method over a period of their useful life generally to years 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if required  for impairment 
for purposes of accounting for its indefinite lived intangibles  the company has established reporting units at a level below the operating segment level 
these reporting units consist principally of the aggregated newspaper print and online operations within six regional groups and the jobsintheus business 
this asset impairment review assesses the fair value of assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undisc ounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset if any are less than the carrying value of the asset 
this approach uses estimates for future market growth  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
changes to these estimates  including the inability to attain forecasted revenue and cost expectations  could result in the recognition of a future impairment loss 
pension and post retirement benefits pension and post retirement benefit costs and credits are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates and expected return on plan assets 
the company considers current market conditions  including changes in interest rates  in selecting these assumptions 
changes in the related pension and post retirement benefit costs or credits may occur in the future as a result of fluctuations in the company s headcount  changes in actuarial assumptions and market performance 
self insurance the company is self insured for a portion of its insurable risks 
the company analyzes its claims experience and other information provided by the company s administrators in determining an adequate liability for self insured claims 
litigation the company is involved in litigation matters that have arisen in the ordinary course of business 
the company believes that the outcome of these legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
revenue recognition revenue is earned from the sale of advertising  circulation and commercial printing 
advertising revenues are recognized  net of agency discounts  in the period when advertising is printed in the company s publications or placed on the company s web sites 
circulation revenues are recognized when purchased newspapers are distributed 
amounts received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are deferred as liabilities

additionally  sfas changes the measurement date to be the end of the company s fiscal year 
the effective date for this part of the statement is for fiscal years ending after december  the company has decided to adopt this part of the standard in the first quarter of accordingly  the company expects to recognize a pre tax reduction to retained earnings of approximately million and a pre tax gain to its accumulated other comprehensive income oci of approximately million  by changing its measurement date to december  in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin  which prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement process for recording in the financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
additionally  fin provides guidance on the derecognition  classification  accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions 
fin is effective for fiscal years  beginning after december  the company is currently assessing the impact of fin which is expe cted to be recorded as a cumulative effect adjustment and offsetting charge to retained earnings for any increased reserves for uncertain tax positions 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
fair value measurements  sfas  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  earlier adoption is permitted  provided the company has not yet issued financial statements  including for interim periods  for that fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the impact of sfas  but does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
certain factors that may affect the company s future performance industry competition the company s business is concentrated in newspapers  web sites and other publications located primarily in small metropolitan and suburban areas in the united states 
revenues in the newspaper industry primarily consist of advertising and paid circulation 
competition for advertising and paid circulation comes from local  regional and national newspapers  shopping guides  television  radio  direct mail  online services and other forms of communication and advertising media 
competition for advertising revenues is based largely upon advertiser results  readership  advertising rates  demographics and circulation levels  while competition for circulation and readership is based largely upon the content of the newspaper  its pr ice and the effectiveness of its distribution 
many of the company s competitors are larger and have greater financial resources than does the company 
dependence on local economies the company s advertising revenues and  to a lesser extent  circulation revenues are dependent on a variety of factors specific to the communities that the company s newspapers serve 
these factors include  among others  the size and demographic characteristics of the local population  local economic conditions in general  and the related retail segments in particular  as well as local weather conditions 
for example  the company s michigan and ohio clusters are particularly impacted by the automotive sector 
capitalization as of december   the consolidated indebtedness of the company was million  which represents a leverage ratio of approximately times the company s twelve months trailing cash flow  as calculated pursuant to the credit agreement 
as of december   the company had a net stockholders equity of million and total capitalization of million and  thus  the percentage of the company s indebtedness to total capitalization was percent 
the company may incur additional indebtedness to  among other things  fund operations  capital expenditures  future acquisitions  share repurchases or dividends 
the company s results of operations will be impacted by fluctuations in int erest rates 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
the company s management believes that cash provided by operating activities  future borrowings and its ability to issue securities will be sufficient to fund its operations and to meet payment requirements under its term loan and the revolving credit facility and pursue acquisition strategies 
however  a decline in cash provided by operating activities  which could result from factors beyond the company s control  such as unfavorable economic conditions  an overall decline in advertising revenues or increased competition could impair the company s ability to service its debt 
the credit agreement requires the maintenance of certain financial ratios and imposes certain operating and financial restrictions on the company  which may restrict  among other things  the company s ability to declare dividends  repurchase company stock  incur indebtedness  create liens  sell assets  consummate mergers and make capital expenditures  investments and acquisitions 
digital media initiatives the company is seeking to grow its online revenues through a number of digital media initiatives 
as part of its growth strategy  the company is expanding resources on developing online products and services internally as well as making acquisitions of  and partnering with online businesses 
there can be no assurances that the company s digital media initiatives will be successful or result in significant online revenue growth 
acquisition strategy the company has grown in part through  and anticipates that it will continue to grow in part through  acquisitions of daily and non daily newspapers  similar publications  web sites and other strategic acquisitions 
on march   the company acquired suburban lifestyles community newspaper group which has been integrated into the michigan cluster 
on december   the company acquired jobsintheus  a group of online recruiting web sites and on august   the company completed its largest acquisition to date  the acquisition of st century 
acquisitions  including those mentioned above  may expose the company to risks  including  without limitation  diversion of management rs quo  s attention  assumption of unidentified liabilities and assimilation of the operations and personnel of acquired businesses  some or all of which could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
depending on the value and nature of the consideration paid by the company for acquisitions  such acquisitions may have a dilutive impact on the company s earnings per share 
in making acquisitions  the company competes for acquisition targets with other companies  many of which are larger and have greater financial resources than does the company 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in identifying acquisition opportunities  assessing the value  strengths and weaknesses of such opportunities  executing acquisitions successfully  achieving anticipated synergies  evaluating the costs of new growth opportunities at existing operations or managing the publications it owns and improving their operating efficiency 
histo rically  the company has financed acquisitions through available cash  borrowings and sales of non strategic properties 
the company anticipates that it will finance future acquisitions through these same resources 
however  the company may elect to issue equity securities to finance any acquisition  which would result in dilution to existing shareholders 
the credit agreement limits acquisitions to certain permitted investments in the united states  and requires that acquisitions be financed through certain permitted sources 
in addition  the financial covenants contained in the credit agreement  may limit the company s ability to make acquisitions 
price and availability of newsprint the basic raw material for newspapers is newsprint 
the company purchases the majority of its newsprint through its central purchasing group  journal register supply 
the company has no long term contracts to purchase newsprint 
generally  journal register supply purchases most of its newsprint from one or two suppliers  although in the future the company may purchase newsprint from other suppliers 
historically  the percentage of newsprint purchased from each supplier has varied 
the company s management believes that concentrating its newsprint purchases in this way provides a more secure newsprint supply and lower unit prices 
the company s management also believes that it purchases newsprint at price levels lower t han those that are generally available to individually owned small metropolitan and suburban newspapers  and consistent with price levels generally available to the largest newsprint purchasers 
the available sources of newsprint have been  and the company believes will continue to be  adequate to supply the company s needs 
the inability of the company to obtain an adequate supply of newsprint in the future could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations of the company 
historically  the price of newsprint has been cyclical and subject to price fluctuations 
the company s average price per ton of newsprint for the full fiscal year increased approximately percent in  increased approximately percent in  and increased approximately percent in  each as compared to the preceding year and on a comparable basis 
the company believes that if any price decrease or increase is sustained in the industry  the company will also be impacted by such change 
the company seeks to manage the effects of increases in prices of newsprint through a combination of  among other things  technology improvements  including web width reductions  inventory management and advertising and circulation price increases 
in fiscal year  the company s newsprint cost excluding paper consumed in the company s commercial printing operations was approximately percent of the company s newspaper revenues 
strikes and other union activity certain of the company s employees at some of its newspapers are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
if the company is unable to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements  it is possible that the affected unions could take action in the form of strikes or work stoppages 
such actions  higher costs in connection with these agreements  or significant labor disputes could adversely affect our business 
environmental matters the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to air and water quality  storage tanks and the management and disposal of waste at its facilities 
to the best of the company s knowledge  its operations are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations as currently interpreted 
the company cannot predict with any certainty whether future events  such as changes in existing laws and regulations or the discovery of conditions not currently known to the company  may give rise to additional costs that could be material 
furthermore  actions by federal  state and local governments concerning environmental matters could result in laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
tax regulations the company is subject to changes in federal  state  and local taxes 
actions by federal  state and local governments concerning tax matters could result in laws or regulations that could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
reconciliation of certain non gaap financial measures the company believes that the use of certain non gaap financial measures enables the company and its analysts  investors and other interested parties to evaluate and compare the company s results from operations and cash resources generated from its business in a more meaningful and consistent manner 
accordingly  this information has been disclosed in this report to permit a more complete comparative analysis of the company s operating performance and capitalization relative to other companies in the industry and to provide an analysis of operating results using certain principal measures used by journal register company s chief operating decision makers to measure the operating results and performance of the co mpany and its field operations 
the company believes the use of ebitda is appropriate given the generally predictable cash flow generated by the company s operations and the short period of time it takes to convert new orders to cash 
ebitda is also the basis of certain covenants contained in the company s credit agreement 
all ebitda figures in this report are non gaap financial measures 
the company defines ebitda as net income plus provision for income taxes  net interest expense  depreciation  amortization and other non cash  special or non recurring charges 
ebitda margin is defined as ebitda divided by total revenues  and is widely used within the company s industry to illustrate the percentage of revenue that is converted into ebitda 
these non gaap financial measures should not be considered as alternatives to gaap measures of performance  such as operating income or net income 
in addition  the company s calculations of these measures may not be consistent with the calculations of these measures by other companies 
the table below provides reconciliations of the differences between net loss income and ebitda from continuing operations for fiscal years through
