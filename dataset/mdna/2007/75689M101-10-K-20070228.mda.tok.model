item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our discussions for the year ending december  refer to a week period with the fifty third week falling in the fourth quarter 
the fiscal years ending december  and december  included weeks 
as of december   we owned and operated  or franchised red robin restaurants in states and canada  of which are company owned and the remaining of which operate under franchise agreements 
in fiscal  we plan to open between and new company owned red robin gourmet burger restaurants and we believe our franchisees will open between and new restaurants 
in addition  we plan to acquire the assets of red robin franchised restaurants in the state of california 
our primary source of revenue is from the sale of food and beverages at company owned restaurants 
we also earn revenue from royalties and fees from franchised restaurants 
the casual dining restaurant industry has become more complex and challenging in recent years 
challenges include increased competition among casual dining restaurant chains for the guest s discretionary dining dollars  increasing labor and benefit costs  increased energy and petroleum based product prices  changes in the economy and increasing real estate and development costs to build new restaurants 
in light of these complexities and challenges  management has pursued a disciplined growth strategy that focuses on adding company owned restaurants and increasing sales at existing restaurants 
in addition  management is focused on managing restaurant operating costs and building our corporate infrastructure to facilitate our long term growth expectations 
the following summarizes the most significant events occurring or affecting us in impact of fifty third week 
in fiscal  the fifty third week added million to restaurant sales and to diluted earnings per share in our consolidated statements of income 
for the purposes of comparison  the calculation of the comparable restaurant sales increases presented for was made on a week fiscal year basis by including the first week of the fiscal year in the comparable restaurant performance for the calculation of average weekly sales presented for was calculated on a week basis  but the and average weekly sales statistics have not been modified from previous disclosures 
franchise acquisition 
we acquired franchised red robin restaurants in the state of washington for million 
the cash purchase price was funded through borrowings under the company s existing credit facility 
the franchised restaurants were owned by various entities affiliated with great western dining  the former manager of the restaurants 
the restaurants collectively are referred to as the acquired restaurants and have been included in our results of operations beginning july  we incurred a charge of million related to the reacquisition of the existing franchise and development agreements of the acquired restaurants 
this charge is reported as reacquired franchise costs in the consolidated statements of income 
comparable restaurant sales 
on a comparable basis of weeks for fiscal and  the increase in comparable restaurants sales was 
this increase reflects an increase in the average guest check of and an increase in guest counts of over average weekly sales volumes for comparable restaurants increased from  in to  in new restaurant openings 
in fiscal  we opened company owned restaurants  many of which were opened in new markets 
approximately of total non comparable restaurant operating weeks were in new markets in compared to in new markets present operational challenges as we expand into markets where we have less brand recognition  a lower concentration of trained team members and generally higher operating costs 
as such  average unit volumes of these restaurants are less than those non comparable restaurants opened in existing markets  where we have an established guest base and higher brand recognition 
in  our non comparable restaurant volumes declined from levels 
adoption of sfas no 
r 
in the first quarter of  the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r  a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective transition method and  therefore we have not retrospectively adjusted results for prior periods 
for the fiscal year ended december   we recognized total pre tax stock based compensation expense of million  of which  and million were recognized in restaurant labor and general and administrative expenses  respectively 
unit data and comparable restaurant sales the following table details data pertaining to the number of restaurant units for both company owned and franchise locations for the years indicated 
company owned beginning of period opened during period acquired or assumed from franchisees end of period franchised beginning of period opened during period sold to company owned closed during period end of period total number of red robin restaurants between december  and february   we opened additional company owned restaurants and our franchisees have opened additional franchise restaurants 
we also closed one company owned restaurant and one franchised restaurant since december   both due to lease expirations 
we expect to open between and company owned restaurants during we anticipate that our franchisees will open between and restaurants during results of operations operating results for each period presented below are expressed as a percentage of total revenues  except for the components of restaurant operating costs  which are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenues weeks revenues restaurant franchise royalties and fees rent revenue total revenues costs and expenses restaurant operating costs cost of sales labor includes  and of stock based compensation expense  respectively operating occupancy total restaurant operating costs depreciation and amortization general and administrative includes  and of stock based compensation expense  respectively franchise development pre opening costs reacquired franchise costs significant and unusual items  net includes  and of stock based compensation expense  respectively income from operations other income expense interest expense interest income gain on sale of property total other expenses income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income certain percentage amounts in the table above do not sum due to rounding as well as the fact that restaurant operating costs are expressed as a percentage of restaurant revenues  as opposed to total revenues 
total revenues in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change restaurant revenue franchise royalties and fees rent revenue total revenues average weekly sales volumes comparable restaurants non comparable restaurants acquired restaurants restaurant revenues  which are comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales  increased by million  or from the inclusion of the fifty third week in contributed million of revenue 
adjusting for this extra week  the increase is driven by the growth in the number of non comparable restaurants  the acquired restaurants  and a increase in comparable restaurant revenues from the increase in comparable restaurant revenues was driven by a increase in guest counts and a increase in the average check 
the revenue growth in over was attributable to the opening of new restaurants in and a increase in comparable restaurant revenues over average weekly sales volumes represent the total restaurant revenue for a population of restaurants in both a comparable and non comparable category for each time period presented divided by the number of operating weeks in the period 
comparable restaurant average weekly sales volumes include those restaurants that are in the comparable base during each period 
at the end of  there were comparable restaurants compared to comparable restaurants in non comparable restaurants included in the average weekly sales volumes calculation include those restaurants that had not yet achieved the five full quarters of operations during the periods presented 
at the end of  there were non comparable restaurants versus in fluctuations in average weekly sales volumes in comparable restaurants reflect the effect of same store sales changes as well as the performance of new restaurants entering the comparable base during the period 
the increase in average comparable weekly sales in was primarily the result of the increase in same store sales growth partially offset by a higher weighting of the less mature restaurants entering the comparable base in the performance of these newer restaurants entering the comparable base reflects the historical ramp up of our restaurants during the early years of operations 
we believe this lower average performance is due to the opening of our new restaurants in a larger ratio of new markets where we have a lower concentration of restaurants  established guests and little or no brand awareness 
approximately of total non comparable restaurant operating weeks in were in new markets compared to in growth in restaurant revenue is expected to continue as we open between and new restaurants in and realize a full year of revenue from our acquired restaurants 
in addition  we will be effecting an approximate price increase early in the second quarter of of which we expect to realize to of this price increase in actual revenue increases 
in addition  we believe our national media campaign scheduled to begin in will increase revenue by improving our guest counts 
franchise royalties and fees  which consist primarily of royalty income and initial franchise fees  increased in due primarily to the restaurants opened by our franchisees during the year and the restaurants opened in  offset by the reduction in franchise fees from the acquired restaurants for the last half of the year 
our franchisees reported that comparable sales for us and canadian restaurants increased and  respectively 
franchise royalties and fees for increased due to franchise restaurants opened during compared to opened in costs and expenses cost of sales in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change cost of sales as a percent of restaurant revenue cost of sales  comprised of food and beverage expenses  are variable and generally fluctuate with sales volume 
as a percentage of restaurant revenues  cost of sales improved  due primarily to lower commodity costs and menu mix changes to lower costs items  as well as the leverage from price increases implemented since june the recent extreme weather in the produce growing states has put pressure on our produce costs in the first quarter of  however  we expect nominal increases in our food costs through in  cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant revenue decreased to compared to  primarily due to lower commodity costs as well as menu mix changes to lower costs items and purchasing initiatives designed to reduce food and beverage costs labor in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change labor as a percent of restaurant revenues labor costs include restaurant hourly wages  fixed management salaries  stock based compensation  bonuses  taxes and benefits for restaurant team members 
labor as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased as a result of increases related to hourly and salaried labor costs as a percentage of revenue in our non comparable restaurants as well as approximately  of stock compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas r 
the increase reflects the higher weighting of labor costs from our less efficient non comparable restaurants opened in and we expect to see an increase in labor as a percentage of restaurant revenues during  compared to  to continue due to state minimum wage increases  as well as due to the continued weighting on our labor costs from our less efficient new restaurants 
in  labor costs increased primarily due to higher salaries and wages  and higher benefit costs from our self insured programs 
operating in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change operating as a percent of restaurant revenues operating costs include variable costs such as restaurant supplies  advertising and energy costs  and fixed costs such as service repairs and maintenance costs 
the increase in operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenues in reflects higher energy expenses 
the higher energy costs were driven by increased rates charged to our restaurants as well as increased usage which resulted from severe weather in our northwest and southwest operations 
supplies expense also reflects higher petroleum based materials costs  fuel surcharges and transportation costs that began to increase our base supply costs in we expect to see the impact of energy costs to lessen in incremental costs of our national advertising campaign is expected to increase operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue 
in  operating costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue increased primarily due to higher energy  supplies  and repairs and maintenance expenses 
our higher energy costs resulted from increases in rates charged to our restaurants for natural gas and oil based utilities 
supplies expense also reflected higher petroleum based materials costs  fuel surcharges and transportation costs that added to our base supply costs in occupancy in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change occupancy as a percent of restaurant revenues occupancy costs include fixed rents  percentage rents  common area maintenance charges  real estate and personal property taxes  general liability insurance and other property costs 
our occupancy costs generally increase with sales volume but decline as a percentage of restaurant revenues as we leverage our fixed costs 
as a percentage of restaurant revenues  occupancy costs were comparable to with modest decreases in insurance and taxes somewhat offset by a modest increase in percentage rent 
occupancy costs as a percentage of restaurant revenue improved in in comparison to as lease costs declined as a percentage of revenue offset by modest increases in insurance and percentage rents 
depreciation and amortization in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change depreciation and amortization as a percent of total revenues depreciation and amortization includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants and corporate assets as well as amortization of acquired franchise rights and liquor licenses 
depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of total revenues increased in primarily due to the increased depreciation and amortization for tangible and intangible assets related to the acquired restaurants as well as the increase in per restaurant costs capitalized for restaurants opened in and in  depreciation and amortization increased over primarily due to the addition of new restaurants in and a full year of depreciation related to the restaurants opened in the increase in depreciation and amortization as a percentage of total revenues was primarily the result of newer restaurants having a higher depreciable costs basis than older restaurants 
general and administrative in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change general and administrative as a percent of total revenues general and administrative costs include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries  bonuses  stock based compensation and related employee benefits  travel  information systems  training  office rent  professional and consulting fees and marketing costs 
general and administrative costs as a percentage of total revenues increased in primarily due to stock based compensation expense related to our adoption of sfas r 
total stock compensation expense was million or of total revenues 
higher headcount and increased salaries made up the remaining difference from during  we plan to add resources to the corporate support and field supervision activities commensurate with the planned openings of between and new restaurants in and to build infrastructure to facilitate our long term growth strategy 
generally  we expect general and administrative expenses to increase from quarter to quarter during but to decline as a percentage of total revenues over time 
our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased over primarily due to a million increase for additional headcount  higher salaries and related costs attributable to operating additional company owned restaurants 
in  we also recorded a million increase in legal fees related  in part  to the matters described in part i  item legal proceedings 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in marketing expenses 
franchise development in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change franchise development as a percent of total revenues franchise development costs include the costs of our franchise and operations support teams including salaries and benefits  travel and training expenses  and costs associated with our annual leadership conference 
franchise development expenses increased in primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our leadership conference  offset by efficiencies and leveraged expenses of our franchise team to support the opening of franchise restaurants 
we anticipate that franchise development cost will continue to be leveraged against increased revenues in as our franchisees begin to provide additional resources to their new restaurant openings and training 
franchise development expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased slightly for compared to franchise development expenses in increased over primarily due to an increase in expenses related to our leadership conference offset by efficiencies and leveraged expenses of our franchise team to support the opening of franchise restaurants 
our franchisees opened restaurants during compared to in pre opening costs in thousands  except percentages percent change percent change pre opening costs as a percent of total revenues average per restaurant pre opening costs pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of labor  hiring and training the initial work force for our new restaurants  travel expenses for our training teams  the cost of food and beverages used in training  marketing costs  lease costs incurred prior to opening and other direct costs related to the opening of new restaurants 
pre opening costs for  and reflect the opening of  and new restaurants respectively 
average per restaurant pre opening costs represent total costs incurred for those restaurants that opened for business during the periods presented 
the increases in our average pre opening costs per restaurant reflects an increase in lease costs incurred prior to opening 
these increased lease costs are driven by the number of restaurants built on leased land versus restaurants built on purchased land 
our new restaurants are weighted more heavily to leased land than our restaurant openings 
we expect that pre opening costs will continue to increase in as we open between and new restaurants  including many in new markets 
in addition  higher pre opening costs per restaurant will reflect costs to implement our new restaurant training initiatives 
significant and unusual items  net on august   we announced the retirement of our then current chairman  president and chief executive officer  and the resignation of our then current senior vice president and former chief financial officer 
these management changes followed an internal investigation commenced during the third quarter of by a special committee of the board of directors relating to use of chartered aircraft and travel and entertainment expenses 
the special committee  which retained independent counsel to conduct the investigation  identified various expenses by our former chairman  president and chief executive officer since that were inconsistent with company policies or that lacked sufficient documentation 
on august   our former chairman  president and chief executive officer entered into a restitution agreement with us  and on august   we received million as reimbursement for these expenses 
in the third quarter of  in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation fin  we recorded a non cash stock based compensation expense of million 
this expense relates to previously modified and exercised stock options of our former chairman  president and chief executive officer and former senior vice president and former chief financial officer 
interest expense interest expense in  and was million  million and million  respectively 
interest expense in was higher due to higher borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility and a slightly higher average interest rate of versus in this increase was partially offset by higher capitalized interest incurred in the construction of our new restaurants during in late  we amended our revolving credit facility to lower the effective interest rates 
however  we believe interest expense will continue to increase as we continue to fund our restaurant unit growth and our potential acquisition of the restaurants in california with additional borrowings 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease was primarily due to more favorable tax credits and state apportionment factors resulting from a shift in our income to states with lower tax rates 
our effective income tax rate was for  for and for we anticipate that out effective tax rate will be approximately 
liquidity and capital resources general 
cash and cash equivalents decreased million to million at december  from million at the beginning of the fiscal year  primarily due to the company s development and construction of new restaurants and acquisition of the washington restaurants 
cash inflows were provided from operating activities  net borrowings under the revolving credit agreement  and to a lesser extent proceeds from the exercise of team member stock options and stock purchases 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new or enhance existing restaurants and to reduce borrowings under our revolving credit agreement 
financial condition 
the company and the restaurant industry in general maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and vendors generally grant trade credit for purchases  such as food and supplies 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new restaurants and refurbishment of existing restaurants  which are reflected as long term assets and not as part of working capital 
credit facility 
effective december  the company amended its credit agreement to provide for an aggregate amount of million to fund the construction and acquisition of new restaurants  to refinance existing indebtedness  to potentially acquire franchise restaurants  and for general corporate purposes  including working capital 
the company has the option to increase the credit facility  subject to lender approval  by up to an additional million 
our credit facility is currently comprised of a million revolving credit facility maturing on december  borrowings under the amended credit agreement bear interest at one of the following rates as selected by the company an alternative base rate abr  which is based on the prime rate plus to or a london interbank offered rate libor  which is based on the relevant one  two  three or six month libor  at the company s discretion  plus to 
in addition to the abr and libor loans  the agreement provides for a swing line loan sub facility which allows the company to borrow up to million 
the credit facility also requires us to pay the lender an annual commitment fee based on the unused portion of the credit facility 
the annual commitment rate and the credit facility s interest rates are based on a financial leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement 
the company and certain of its subsidiaries granted liens in substantially all personal property assets and certain real property assets to secure our obligations under the credit facility 
as long as the company meets a certain financial leverage ratio  the company will not be required to mortgage or encumber real property assets acquired in the future 
additionally  certain of our real and personal property secure other indebtedness of the company 
at december   we had million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility and had letters of credit outstanding against our credit facility of million 
covenants 
we are subject to a number of customary covenants under our various credit agreements  including limitations on additional borrowings  acquisitions  dividend payments  and requirements to maintain certain financial ratios 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
total debt outstanding increased to million at december  from million at december   due to additional borrowings to construct new restaurants  finance our franchise acquisition  and acquire other assets  offset by payments made on capital lease obligations 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other non current liabilities long term debt obligations represent borrowings under our revolving credit agreement and other collateralized notes payable  including interest of million 
capital lease obligations include interest of million 
operating lease obligations represent future minimum lease commitments payable for land  buildings and equipment used in our operations 
this table excludes contingent rents  including amounts which are determined as a percentage of adjusted sales in excess of specified levels 
purchase obligations include commitments for the construction of new restaurants and other capital improvement projects and lease commitments for company owned restaurants where leases have been executed but construction has not begun 
other non current liabilities include executive deferred compensation  accrued restaurant bonuses for long term incentive plans  franchise deposits and vendor deposits 
capital expenditures 
capital expenditures  including capital lease obligations  were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
fiscal  compared with fiscal  includes higher expenditures for new restaurants as well as increases in facility improvements 
the increase in cash flows utilized in compared with was primarily due to expenditures for new restaurant construction and remodeling 
in fiscal year  capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million to million 
in addition to the construction of to new restaurants  we will continue our investment in restaurant remodels and capital improvements as well as expanding our corporate infrastructure to support our growth model 
we have also announced plans to acquire franchise owned restaurants with an estimated purchase price of approximately million 
we will fund the acquisition of these restaurants using borrowings from our existing credit facility 
future liquidity 
we require capital principally to grow the business through new restaurant construction  as well as to maintain  improve and refurbish existing restaurants  and for general operating purposes 
in addition  we may use capital in the acquisition of franchise restaurants 
our primary short term and long term sources of liquidity are expected to be cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
additional potential sources of liquidity to a lesser extent include the issuance of company stock under our stock option and employee stock purchase plans 
based upon current levels of operations and anticipated growth  we expect that cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet debt service  capital expenditures and working capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor costs  energy costs  and materials used in the construction of new restaurants 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage have directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has had a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations in the current year  due primarily to higher energy costs  higher costs for certain supplies and petroleum based products  higher costs for materials and labor related to construction of our new restaurants and  to a lesser extent  commodity prices for certain foods we purchase at market rates 
uncertainties related to higher costs  including energy costs  commodity prices  wages such as the potential federal minimum wage increase  and construction materials make it difficult to predict what impact  if any  inflation may have on our business during seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and other factors 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the following as the company s most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most subjective and complex judgment 
information regarding the company s other significant accounting policies is disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation expense 
effective december   the beginning of the first quarter of fiscal year  we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
therefore  we have not retrospectively adjusted prior periods results 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation using the black scholes option pricing model and recognize expense on a graded vesting basis over the requisite service periods of an option  net of our expectation of forfeitures 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective and judgmental assumptions  including volatility  interest rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model or our assumption of forfeiture rates change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
property and equipment 
property and equipment is recorded at cost 
expenditures for major additions and improvements are capitalized and minor replacements  maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful life for owned assets and the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the underlying lease for leased assets 
changes in circumstances  such as changes to our business model or changes in our capital strategy  can result in the actual useful lives differing from our estimates 
in those cases where management determines that the useful life of property and equipment should be shortened  we would depreciate the net book value over its revised remaining useful life thereby increasing depreciation and amortization expense 
factors such as changes in the planned use of fixtures or closing of facilities could also result in shortened useful lives 
our accounting policies regarding property and equipment include judgments by management regarding the estimated useful lives of these assets  the expected lease term for assets related to properties under lease and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact management s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of long lived assets 
long lived assets  including restaurant sites  leasehold improvements  other fixed assets and amortized intangible assets are reviewed when indicators of impairment are present 
expected cash flows associated with an asset are the key factor in determining the recoverability of the asset 
identifiable cash flows are generally measured at the restaurant level 
the estimate of cash flows is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance 
management s estimates of undiscounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  changes in economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss  measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
judgments made by management related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance 
as the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of long lived assets are assessed  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
there were no asset impairment charges during the fiscal years ended december   december  or december  goodwill 
we also evaluate goodwill annually or more frequently if indicators of impairment are present 
the evaluation is based upon a comparison of the carrying value of our net assets including goodwill balances to the fair value of our net assets using the quoted market price of our common stock 
we completed our most recent goodwill impairment test in december and determined that there were no impairment losses related to goodwill 
in the event that business conditions change and our market value were to drop significantly below year end levels  future tests may result in a need to record a loss due to a write down of the value of goodwill 
at december   goodwill recorded in the consolidated balance sheet totaled million 
lease accounting 
under the provisions of certain of our leases  there are rent holidays and or escalations in payments over the base lease term  as well as renewal periods 
the effects of rent holidays and escalations are reflected in rent costs on a straight line basis over the expected lease term  which includes cancelable option periods when it is deemed to be reasonably assured that we will exercise such option periods due to the fact that we would incur an economic penalty for not doing so 
the lease term commences on the date when we become legally obligated for the rent payments which generally coincides with the time when the landlord delivers the property for us to develop and we waive contract contingencies 
all rent costs recognized during construction periods are expensed immediately as pre opening expenses 
judgments made by management with respect to the company s lease obligations include the probable term for each lease that affects the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holidays and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent  and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant facility are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
insurance self insurance liabilities 
the company is self insured for a portion of losses related to group health insurance  general liability and workers compensation 
we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total exposure 
the self insurance liability represents an estimate of the cost of claims incurred and unpaid as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is established based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial based estimates  and is closely monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
in addition  our history of self insured experience is short and our significant rate of growth could affect the accuracy of estimates based on historical experience 
should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or should medical costs increase beyond what was expected  our accrued liabilities might not be sufficient and additional expenses may be recorded 
actual claims experience could also be more favorable than estimated  resulting in expense reductions 
unanticipated changes may produce materially different amounts of expense than those reported under these programs 
off balance sheet arrangements except for operating leases primarily restaurant leases entered into the normal course of business we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
recent accounting pronouncements in february   the fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas no 
on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement applies whenever other statements require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas is effective for our fiscal year beginning december  we are evaluating the impact the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive financial statement model of how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take in its income tax returns 
fin requires that only income tax benefits that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold be recognized or continue to be recognized on the effective date 
initial derecognition amounts would be reported as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
fin is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we are assessing the impact the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued eitf issue  how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement eitf 
a consensus was reached that entities may adopt a policy of presenting sales taxes in the income statement on either a gross or net basis 
if taxes are significant  an entity should disclose its policy of presenting taxes and the amounts of taxes 
the guidance is effective for our fiscal year beginning january  we present company sales net of sales taxes 
eitf will not impact the method for recording these sales taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk exposures for our assets are related to cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
under our revolving credit agreement  amended in december  we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings  which bear interest at one of the following rates we select an alternate base rate abr  based on the prime rate plus to  or a libor  based on the relevant one  two  three or six month libor  at our discretion  plus to 
the spread  or margin  for abr and libor loans under the revolving credit agreement are subject to quarterly adjustment based on our then current leverage ratio  as defined by the agreement 
our variable rate based loans with ge capital bear interest at the day commercial paper rate plus a fixed percentage of to 
as of december   we had million of borrowings subject to variable interest rates  and a change in the effective interest rate applied to these loans would have resulted in pre tax interest expense fluctuating million on an annualized basis 
all of our transactions are conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  we are not exposed to foreign currency risk 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
