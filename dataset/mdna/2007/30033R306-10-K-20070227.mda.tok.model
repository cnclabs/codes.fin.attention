item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive overview we develop  manufacture  market and sell solar power products enabled by our proprietary string ribbon tm technology that provide reliable and environmentally clean electric power throughout the world 
string ribbon technology is an efficient process for manufacturing crystalline silicon wafers  which are primary components of photovoltaic cells 
photovoltaic cells generate direct and current electricity when exposed to sunlight 
we believe that our proprietary and patented technologies offer significant design  cost and manufacturing advantages over competing solar power technologies 
our revenues today are primarily derived from the sale of solar modules  which are assemblies of photovoltaic cells that have been electrically interconnected and laminated in a physically durable and weather tight package 
we sell our products using distributors  systems integrators and other value added resellers  who often add value through system design by incorporating our modules with electronics  structures and wiring systems 
applications for our products include on grid generation  in which supplemental electricity is provided to an electric utility grid  and off grid generation for markets where access to conventional electric power is not economical or physically feasible 
our products are currently sold primarily in germany and the united states 
our product sales are currently constrained by our manufacturing capacity at our marlboro  massachusetts facility 
despite having an installed capacity of approximately mw in our marlboro facility  it is our intention to dedicate a sizable portion this capacity to developing new technologies with the goal of further improvements in operations and product performance  and therefore  we do not expect to operate at the full manufacturing capacity at our marlboro facility 
furthermore  despite expected substantial capital expenditures at our marlboro facility  we do not expect to significantly expand its manufacturing capacity  rather  such expenditures will be used to demonstrate improved technologies 
in january  we entered into a strategic partnership agreement with q cells ag  or q cells 
q cells is the world s largest independent manufacturer of solar cells  whose crystalline silicon solar cells are among the highest efficiency polycrystalline solar cells commercially available 
the agreement provided for the organization and capitalization of everq gmbh  or everq  which is a limited liability company incorporated under the laws of germany 
in november  renewable energy corporation asa  or rec  based in hovik  norway and one of the world s largest manufacturers of solar grade silicon and multicrystalline wafers  joined the everq partnership 
the purpose of everq is to develop and operate facilities to manufacture  market and sell solar products based on our proprietary string ribbon technology using fabrication processes that combine our  q cells and rec s manufacturing technologies 
we believe that everq will accelerate the availability of wafer  cell and module manufacturing capacity based on string ribbon technology and provide greater access to the european solar market 
everq began production during the first quarter of and shipped its first product to customers in april on september   in conjunction with the execution of a previously disclosed polysilicon supply agreement  which became effective on december   following regulatory approval  
table of contents the company  q cells and rec also entered into an amendment to the existing master joint venture agreement whereby the company  rec and q cells became equal partners in everq 
as a result of the capital contribution to everq made by q cells and rec to increase their ownership interest  we recorded a gain on our investment in everq of approximately million that was recorded as an increase in additional paid in capital 
everq currently expects to ramp production capacity from about mw in to approximately mw by everq began its expansion in thalheim  germany with the construction of a second integrated wafer  cell and module factory with a capacity of approximately mw during the third quarter of  and production is expected to begin in the first half of and reach full capacity by year end we expect that the combined production of our marlboro facility and everq will be used to satisfy the requirements of the sales agreements that we have entered into over the past months 
on november   we announced a four year  million sales agreement with powerlight corporation  a leader in developing innovative solar electric technologies and large scale  grid connected projects for customers worldwide 
on february   we announced that we had entered into a four year supply contract with sag solarstrom ag sag  based in freiburg  germany 
the agreement calls for approximately million of photovoltaic modules to be shipped to sag over the next four years 
on february   we announced that we had entered into a multi year supply contract with global resource options  inc gro  a vermont based solar power distributor and system integrator 
the agreement calls for approximately million of photovoltaic modules to be shipped to gro over the next four years 
on march   we announced that we had entered into a multi year supply contract with donauer solartechnik donauer  a german based solar power distributor 
the agreement calls for approximately million of photovoltaic modules to be shipped to donauer over the next four years 
on july   we announced that we had entered into a multi year supply agreement with sunedison llc sunedison  a maryland based system integrator 
the agreement calls for approximately m of photovoltaic modules to be shipped to sunedison over the next four years 
on october   we announced that we had entered into a multi year supply contract with mainstream energy  llc mainstream  a california based solar power distributor and system integrator 
the agreement calls for approximately m of photovoltaic modules to be shipped to mainstream over the next four years 
three of these agreements each have bilateral termination penalties ranging from million to million 
we expect to meet the requirements under these contracts primarily with product manufactured by everq 
everq may be required to incur further capital expenditures in order to meet the future requirements of these contracts 
through december   we consolidated the financial results of everq and recognized revenues associated with the sale of everq product 
as of december   we no longer consolidate the financial results of everq and accordingly  do not recognize gross revenues or cost of goods sold associated with the sale of everq product 
however  under our sales agreement with everq  we will continue to market and sell all solar modules manufactured by everq under the evergreen solar brand  as well as manage customer relationships and contracts 
as a result  our reported product revenues will be significantly lower in we expect to develop additional market partnerships to support the expected aggressive sales growth of everq 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities coupled with our ability to access the capital markets  will be sufficient to fund our planned capital programs  our current commitments with everq and our operating expenditures over the next twelve months 
we may be required to raise additional capital to respond to competitive pressures  to acquire complementary businesses  to provide further funding for everq  to secure silicon and other raw materials and or necessary technologies 
we do not know whether we will be able to raise additional capital on terms favorable to us 
if adequate capital is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  further develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
accounting for everq on december   the company  q cells and rec became equal partners in everq and now share equally in its prospective net income or loss 
as a result of our reduction in ownership to one third  we were 
table of contents required to account for our interest in everq under the equity method of accounting  changing from consolidating its operating results as we have in the past 
under the equity method of accounting  we will report our one third share of everq s net income or loss as a single line item in our income statement and our investment in everq as a single line item in our balance sheet 
we have applied the equity method as of december  under the new agreements with everq and its partners  we will continue to market and sell all solar modules manufactured by everq under the evergreen solar brand  as well as manage customer relationships and contracts 
we will receive fees from everq for reimbursement of our expenses and will no longer report gross revenue or cost of goods sold resulting from the sale of everq s solar modules 
during  we will receive a fee of of gross everq revenue relating to the sales and marketing fee 
in addition  we will receive royalty payments associated with our ongoing technology agreement with everq 
combined  the sales and marketing fee and royalty payments will total approximately of gross everq revenue 
we also expect to receive payments from everq as a reimbursement of certain research and development costs we will incur that could benefit everq 
income statement classification of these research and development reimbursement payments will depend on how we are reimbursed 
a best efforts arrangement allows for the reimbursement to offset expenses whereas a specific performance arrangement requires us to record both revenue and an offsetting cost of revenue 
we believe that the majority of these reimbursements will be best efforts in nature and therefore will be shown as a reduction of our expenses 
while these revenue streams are based on current expansion and financial expectations of everq  as well as expected future technology developments  they are subject to periodic review and adjustment by the shareholders of everq and could vary widely from these estimates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if applicable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize product revenue if there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer  shipment has occurred  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the market for solar power products is emerging and rapidly evolving 
we currently sell our solar power products primarily to distributors  system integrators and other value added resellers within and outside of north america  which typically resell our products to end users throughout the world 
for new customers requesting credit  we evaluate creditworthiness based on credit applications  feedback from provided references  and credit reports from independent agencies 
for existing customers  we evaluate creditworthiness based on payment history and known changes in their financial condition 
we also evaluate the facts and circumstances related to our customers and consider whether risk of loss has not passed to the customer upon shipment 
we consider whether our customer is purchasing our product for stock  and whether contractual or implied rights to return the product exist or whether our customer has an end user contractually committed 
to date  we have not offered rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  such that their ability to make payments was impaired  additional allowances could be required 

table of contents revenue from research grants is recognized as services are rendered to the extent of allowable costs incurred 
warranty given our limited operating history  prior to the first quarter of  we used historical industry solar panel failure rates  adjusted for the differences and uncertainties associated with our manufacturing process  as a basis for the accrued warranty costs 
we have provided for estimated future warranty costs of approximately  as of december   representing our best estimate of the likely expense associated with fulfilling our obligations under such warranties 
we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  in an effort to ensure the quality of our product and reduce our warranty exposure 
our warranty obligation will be effected not only by our product failure rates  but also the costs to repair or replace failed products and potentially service and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if our actual product failure rates  repair or replacement costs  service or delivery costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted in the period that such events or costs become known 
stock based compensation on january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment and related interpretations sfas r 
sfas r requires entities to measure compensation cost arising from the grant of share based payments to employees at fair value and to recognize such cost in income over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period 
we selected the modified prospective method for implementing sfas r and began applying the provisions to stock based awards granted on or after january   plus any unvested awards granted prior to january  total equity compensation expense recognized during the year ended december  was approximately million 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the awards service periods  which are the vesting periods  less estimated forfeitures 
estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of the effective date will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost estimated for the sfas r pro forma disclosures for prior periods 
the fair value of each stock option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the following weighted average assumptions expected options term risk free interest rate expected dividend yield none none none volatility see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock based compensation assumptions and expenses  including pro forma disclosures for prior periods as if we had recorded stock based compensation expense in accordance with sfas r 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
certain factors may impact the realizable value of our inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  changes in product mix strategy  new product introductions and significant changes to our cost structure 
estimates of obsolescence are based on the product on hand and its expected net realizability 
if actual market conditions are less favorable or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write downs or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we consider lower of cost or market adjustments and inventory reserves as an adjustment to the cost basis of the underlying inventory 
accordingly  favorable changes in market conditions are not recorded to inventory in subsequent periods 

table of contents long lived assets our policy regarding long lived assets is to evaluate the recoverability or usefulness of these assets when the facts and circumstances suggest that these assets may be impaired 
this analysis relies on a number of factors  including changes in strategic direction  business plans  regulatory developments  economic and budget projections  technological improvements  and operating results 
the test of recoverability or usefulness is a comparison of the asset value to the undiscounted cash flow of its expected cumulative net operating cash flow over the asset s remaining useful life 
if such a test indicates that an impairment is required  then the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
any write downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amounts of the assets and an operating loss would be recognized 
to date  we have had recurring operating losses and the recoverability of our long lived assets is contingent upon executing our business plan that includes further reducing our manufacturing costs and significantly increasing sales 
if we are unable to execute our business plan  we may be required to write down the value of our long lived assets in future periods 
all of our long lived assets are located in the united states 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences together with net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent that we determine that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized  a valuation allowance is established 
taxable income in future periods significantly different from that projected may cause adjustments to the valuation allowance that could materially increase or decrease future income tax expense 
results of operations description of our revenues  costs and expenses revenues 
total revenues for the company consist of revenues from the sale of products and to a lesser extent  research revenue 
product revenues consist of revenues from the sale of solar cells  panels and systems 
research revenues consist of revenues form various state and federal government agencies to fund our ongoing research  development  testing and enhancement of our products and manufacturing technologies 
our current intention is not to pursue research contracts that are not part of our ongoing research activities 
product revenues represented  and of total revenues  in  and  respectively 
international product sales accounted for approximately  and of total product revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we had one active multi year research contract with the national renewable energy laboratory 
we anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our product revenues for the foreseeable future 
currently  all european sales are denominated in euros  which increases our risk of incurring foreign exchange gains or losses 
as we expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network internationally  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may increase 

table of contents the following table summarizes our concentration of total revenue of total revenue by geography united states germany spain all other by customer krannich solartechnik donauer solartechnik powerlight corporation all other cost of product revenues 
cost of product revenues consists primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  materials expenses  depreciation expenses  maintenance  rent  compensation cost associated with the adoption of sfas r and other support expenses associated with the manufacture of our solar power products 
research and development expenses  including cost of research revenues 
research and development expenses  including cost of research revenues  consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  compensation costs associated with the adoption of sfas r  consulting expenses and prototype costs related to the design  engineering  development  testing and enhancement of our products  manufacturing equipment and manufacturing technology 
we expense our research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic objectives of enhancing our technology  reducing manufacturing costs and meeting the changing requirements of our customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  compensation costs associated with the adoption of sfas r  accounting and legal fees  rent  insurance and other selling and administrative expenses 
we expect that selling expenses will increase substantially in absolute dollars as we increase our sales efforts  hire additional sales personnel and initiate additional marketing programs 
however  future increases in selling expenses may be reimbursed by everq 
other income loss 
other income consists of interest income primarily from interest earned on the holding of short term marketable securities  bond premium amortization or discount accretion  interest on outstanding debt and net foreign exchange gains and losses 
equity income in everq 
as of december   we began accounting for our share of everq s results under the equity method of accounting  which requires us to record our one third share of everq s net income or loss as one line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
during the period from december  to december   everq recorded approximately million in net income  of which we recorded approximately  in our consolidated statement of operations 
minority interest 
through december   we consolidated the financial results of everq in our financial statements 
through december   everq incurred losses of million  which are consolidated in our financial statements 
however   of those losses represent the portion of everq losses attributable to the q cells and rec minority interests for the period ended december  accretion  dividends and conversion premiums on series a convertible preferred stock 
on may   we issued  shares of series a convertible preferred stock at a per share purchase price of to several purchasers 
outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock were entitled to a compounding 
table of contents dividend of per annum  paid quarterly  in cash  or at our election to be added to the liquidation preference of the series a convertible preferred stock on a quarterly basis  which would result in an increase in the number of shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the series a convertible preferred stock 
on june   holders of all outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock agreed to convert all of their shares of series a convertible preferred stock into shares of our common stock in connection with our private placement financing 
during the first quarter of  the series a convertible preferred stock earned a dividend of approximately million  which we elected to add to the liquidation preference of the series a convertible preferred stock 
as an inducement to convert their shares into common stock in connection with our june private placement financing  the remaining series a preferred stockholders received the dividend earned for the period between april  and june  in cash  which totaled approximately million 
in addition  the series a convertible preferred stockholders received a cash conversion premium of of the accreted value as of march   which totaled million 
therefore  the total dividend and conversion premium charge we recorded for the period ended december  was approximately million 
net loss attributable to common stockholders 
net loss attributable to common stockholders consists of net losses and dividends earned by the series a convertible preferred stockholders 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
our product revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in the increase in product revenues was due primarily to sales of product manufactured by everq  which began shipping product in and accounted for approximately million of total revenue 
the first everq factory was completed in and reached its full capacity run rate by the fourth quarter of research revenues for the year ended december  were  an increase of  or  from  for the same period in the current active research contract with national renewable energy began during the third quarter of through december   we consolidated the financial results of everq and recognized revenues associated with the sale of everq products 
after december   we no longer consolidate the financial results of everq and accordingly  do not recognize revenues associated with the sale of everq product 
however  under our sales agreement with everq  we will continue to market and sell all solar modules manufactured by everq under the evergreen solar brand  as well as manage customer relationships and contracts 
we will receive fees from everq for reimbursement of our expenses  and will no longer report gross revenue or cost of goods sold resulting from the sale of everq s solar module production 
as a result  our reported product revenues will be significantly lower in however  worldwide sales of product manufactured using our string ribbon technology  which includes products manufactured at our marlboro facility  as well as everq products  should increase substantially as everq s second factory is completed during the first half of cost of product revenues and gross margin 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in the increase was due to the cost of product revenues associated with production at everq  which accounted for approximately million of total cost of product revenue 
gross margin for the year ended december  was versus for the year ended december  the year over year improvement in product gross margin primarily resulted from improving gross margins of everq as manufacturing reached full capacity at its first manufacturing facility 
further improvements in gross margin may result from increases in manufacturing scale and technology improvements 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in approximately of the increase was due to increased labor costs including million of expense related to the adoption of sfas r and approximately of the increase was due to increases in material costs associated with internal initiatives aimed at improving our manufacturing technology 

table of contents loss on disposal of fixed assets 
during the year  as a result of the successful introduction of new manufacturing technology  we disposed of existing equipment in order to replace them with more technologically advanced equipment expected to improve operational performance of our technology 
equipment with a total net book value of million was disposed of 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in approximately of the increase was due to increased compensation costs associated with additional personnel including million of expense related to the adoption of sfas r  net of terminations  approximately of the increase was due to general and administrative costs incurred by everq which are included in our consolidated statement of operations through december   approximately related to increased legal and accounting expenses and most of the remainder was due to an increase in sales and marketing expenses incurred to support the increase in worldwide sales 
other income 
other income for the period ended december  was comprised of million in net foreign exchange gains  million in interest income and million in interest expense 
other income for the period ended december  consisted of  in foreign exchange gains   gain on the sale of a portion of our everq interest to rec  million in interest income and million in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was due to the larger average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances during due to the common stock and subordinated convertible debt financings 
interest expense increased due to interest charges associated with increased debt incurred by everq as well as the impact of a full year s worth of interest expense related to the convertible notes 
net loss 
net loss was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the increase in net loss was due primarily to the overall increase in net operating losses associated with the scale up of everq operations as well as the impact of recognizing million in expense related to the adoption of sfas r 
comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
our product revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in the increase in product revenues was due primarily to the doubling of production capacity at our manufacturing facility in marlboro  massachusetts 
research revenues for the year ended december  were  a decrease of  or  from million for the same period in research revenue decreased because our last active research contract with the national renewable energy laboratory expired during the first quarter of  and our current research contract with the national renewable energy laboratory began in july cost of product revenues 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in substantially all of the increase was due to increases in materials and labor costs associated with the increased production of the marlboro manufacturing facility 
product gross margin improved to primarily due to improvements in yield and efficiency  increased sales volume and favorable exchange rates 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in approximately of the increase was due to increased labor costs associated with additional personnel  approximately of the increase was due to increases associated with internal initiatives aimed to improve our manufacturing technology including the thin ribbon and quad furnace technologies and activities associated with the planning for the next manufacturing capacity expansion  and approximately of the increase was due to engineering costs associated with the development of the manufacturing process of everq 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  from million in approximately of the increase was due to general and administrative costs incurred by everq  approximately of the increase was due to increased compensation costs associated with added personnel  
table of contents and most of the remainder of the increase was due to increased costs associated with the requirement to comply with various aspects of the sarbanes oxley act  most notably section regarding reporting on internal controls over financial reporting 
other income loss 
other income for the period ended december  was comprised of  in net foreign exchange gains   from the gain on the sale of a portion of our initial interest in everq to rec  million in interest income and million in interest expense 
other loss for the period ended december  consisted of  in foreign exchange losses   in interest income and  in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was due to the larger cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances due to the common stock and subordinated convertible debt financings 
interest expense increased due to interest charges associated with the subordinated convertible debt issued in june net loss 
net loss was million and million for the years ending december  and december   respectively 
the decrease in net loss was due to a decrease in the combined accretion and dividend charges associated with the conversion to common shares of the series a preferred stock  partially offset by an overall increase in net operating losses associated with the scale up of our operations 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through sales of our capital stock  issuance of debt and  to a lesser extent  product revenues 
research and development expenditures have historically been partially funded by government research contracts 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the use of cash for operating activities in the year ended december  was due primarily to losses from operations of million  increases in accounts receivable of million and increases in inventory of million offset by a net increase in deferred grants funding of million  increases in accrued expenses of million and depreciation expense and losses on fixed assets disposals of million 
in general  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to supporting the increase in working capital requirements of everq as the first manufacturing facility ramped to full production by the end of the third quarter of since we consolidated the cash flows of everq through december   the increase in working capital requirements are included in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the use of cash for operating activities in the year ended december  was due primarily to losses from operations of million and an increase in other current assets of million  offset by increases in accounts payable of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and depreciation and losses on fixed asset disposals of million 
the use of cash for operating activities in the year ended december  was due primarily to losses from operations of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million  offset by increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of approximately million and depreciation and losses on fixed asset disposals of million 
net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december   and was primarily due to purchases of equipment and marketable securities  partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities 
as of december   we no longer consolidate the balance sheet of everq and therefore  our cash balance at december  excludes everq s cash balances  and the decrease in everq s cash balance is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily represents an increase in everq debt through december  and cash received upon the exercise of stock options and warrants 
the cash provided by financing activities 
table of contents for the year ended december  primarily represents net proceeds from common stock issued in conjunction with the common stock public offering completed in february as well as the convertible subordinated debt issuance in june the cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december  represents net proceeds from common stock issued in conjunction with the common stock private placement  offset by dividends and conversion premiums paid to the series a convertible preferred shareholders 
capital expenditures were million  million which includes million of deposits for the manufacture of fixed assets and million which includes million of deposits for the manufacture of fixed assets for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were primarily for equipment needed for our marlboro manufacturing facility 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  were primarily for equipment needed for our manufacturing facility and equipment for everq 
as of december   we had outstanding commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million 
nearly all of our commitments for capital expenditures are associated with infrastructure improvements and equipment purchases for our marlboro facility  including the build out of our research and development facility in marlboro 
in february  we completed a million common stock offering  net of offering costs of approximately million  to satisfy existing capital requirements and to fund the continuing capacity expansion of our marlboro  massachusetts manufacturing and development facilities and the expenditures necessary for the initial build out and initial operation of everq 
for this common stock offering  we issued  shares of our common stock 
the shares of common stock were sold at a per share price of before deducting underwriting discounts  which represented a discount to the closing price of shares of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq global market as of the close of business on february  in june  we issued convertible subordinated notes notes in the aggregate principal amount of million  and we received proceeds of million  net of offering costs 
a portion of the proceeds from the financing was used to increase research and development spending on promising next generation technologies  to explore further expansion opportunities and to fulfill our commitments with everq 
interest on the notes is payable semiannually at the annual rate of 
the notes do not have required principal payments prior to maturity on july  however  the notes are convertible at any time prior to maturity  redemption or repurchase  into shares of our common at an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment 
on or after july   we may redeem the notes for cash at the following prices expressed as a percentage of the principal amount redemption period price beginning on july  and ending on june  beginning on july  and ending on june  on july  we may redeem the notes on or after july  and prior to july  only if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the then current conversion price of the notes for at least trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the trading day prior to the date on which we provide notice of redemption 
we may be required to repurchase the notes upon a designated event either a termination of trading or a change in control at a price which will be in cash or  in the case of a change in control  cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of both equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased plus accrued interest 
upon a change in control  we may under certain circumstances be required to pay a premium on redemption which will be a number of additional shares of our common stock as determined by our stock price and the effective date of the change in control 
the notes are subordinate in right of payment to all of our existing and future senior debt 

table of contents we incurred financing costs of approximately million which are being amortized ratably over the seven year term of the notes 
for the year ended december   we recorded million in interest expense associated with the notes 
everq debt guarantee everq entered into a credit agreement  dated november   between everq  q cells ag  evergreen and a syndicate of banks led by deutsche bank aktiengesellschaft and bayerische hypo und vereinsbank ag the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides everq with aggregate borrowing availability of up to million euro comprised as follows i a long term loan facility amounting to million euro  ii a short term loan facility amounting to million euro and iii a short term revolving credit facility amounting to million euro 
the facility a interest rate is the euro interbank offered rate euribor plus between and depending on whether everq meets certain financial targets specified in the credit agreement 
the facility b interest rate is euribor plus and the facility c interest rate is 
in the event of a default by everq  evergreen has agreed to relinquish certain rights to certain assets of everq which collateralize everq s repayment obligations under the credit facility 
in addition  pursuant to the credit agreement  evergreen has agreed to guarantee everq s repayment obligations under the credit agreement 
as of december   everq had total obligations outstanding under this credit agreement of million euro million at december  exchange rates 
evergreen solar loans to everq in november  we entered into a shareholder loan agreement to provide everq with a loan totaling million euro 
during  we provided everq with additional loans to help fund the initial financing requirement of the first two factories currently under construction 
additional loans may be required by the shareholders of everq to partially finance future everq expansions 
the table below summarizes the principal and terms of all outstanding loans provided by the company date of loan principal principal usd interest rate date due november    june  february    june  april    january  april    january  june    january  june    january  august    january  november    january  we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  coupled with our ability to access the capital markets  will be sufficient to fund our planned capital programs  our current commitments with everq and our operating expenditures over the next twelve months 
we may be required to raise additional capital to respond to competitive pressures  to acquire complementary businesses  to provide further funding for everq  to secure raw materials and or necessary technologies
