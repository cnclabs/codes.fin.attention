item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview adtran  inc designs  develops  manufactures  markets  and services a broad range of high speed network access products utilized by providers of telecommunications services and enterprise end users 
we currently sell our products to a large number of service providers  including the three largest telecommunications providers and to private and public enterprises worldwide 
our success depends upon our ability to increase unit volume and market share through the introduction of new products and succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors 
we reduce the cost of each succeeding product generation and then lower the product s selling price to gain market share and or to improve gross margins based on the cost savings achieved 
as a part of this strategy  we seek in most instances to be a high quality  low cost provider of products in our markets 
our success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign  allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation 
this strategy enables us to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers  while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers 
sales decreased this year compared to last year as a result of decreases in dbt total reach  hdsl t  and systems product revenues 
sales were negatively impacted by a decrease in international sales primarily attributable to a major carrier s completion in of a new network build out of a particular service and decreases in spending by some larger domestic carriers 
dbt total reach sales decline is the result of newer and higher speed technologies replacing the lower speed technology of isdn and dds products 
we have maintained our overall market share in dbt total reach and continue to take advantage of market opportunities for these products where speed is not the main consideration  however  dbt total reach is a declining market  which is being cannibalized by higher speed dsl technologies 
hdsl t sales decline is primarily attributable to declining enterprise networks sales of channel service units data service units csu dsu products and fixed wireless products 
the industry has integrated the functionality of csu dsus into access routers  thereby reducing the requirement for a standalone csu dsu 
fixed wireless product revenues decreased in due to lower spending for wireless backhaul applications 
the decline in hdsl revenues to carriers is primarily attributable to lower spending for wireless backhaul infrastructure in and decreases in spending by some larger domestic carriers 
systems product sales decline is primarily attributable to decreases in iad  m multiplexer  concentrator  optical access  and international broadband access revenues  partially offset by increases in domestic broadband access product revenues  netvanta and multi service access gateway product revenues 
increases in domestic broadband access product revenues  netvanta and multi service access gateway product revenues are primarily attributable to new product introductions  market share gains  expansion of domestic carrier broadband services and increasing utilization of ip infrastructure by enterprise customers 
the decrease in iad revenues is primarily attributable to declines in average selling prices relating to consolidation in the clec market 
the decrease in m multiplexer and concentrator revenues is primarily attributable to consolidation in the clec market 
the decrease in optical access revenues is primarily related to decreases in spending by some larger domestic carriers 
the decrease in international broadband access sales is primarily attributable to a major customer s completion in of a new network build out of a particular service 
future sales in regard to this service are now expected to be correlated to the addition of new subscribers 
in january  we announced we would begin reporting new product categories in order to increase transparency in major product areas 
the new product categories to be reported will be loop access carrier systems business networking 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this report for further information regarding the new product categories 
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past  and operating results may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors 
we normally operate with very little order backlog 
the majority of our sales in each quarter result from orders booked in that quarter and firm purchase orders released in that quarter by customers under agreements containing non binding purchase commitments 
many of our customers require prompt delivery of products 
this results in a limited backlog of orders for these products and requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand 
if near term demand for 
table of contents our products declines  or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated  our financial results could be adversely affected 
operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  therefore  a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact our financial results in a given quarter 
maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory that may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of this inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
our operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors  including increased competition  customer order patterns  changes in product mix  timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions  product warranty returns  and announcements of new products by us or our competitors 
accordingly  our historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results  and  in general  management expects that our financial results may vary from period to period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
on january   we announced that danny j 
windham  president  chief operating officer and secretary of adtran  would be resigning effective february  to become the chief executive officer of digium  inc mr 
windham also resigned from adtran s board of directors effective february  our executive management team has assumed mr 
windham s previous responsibilities 
critical accounting policies and estimates an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates reasonably could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimate that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the results of financial operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied across our two reportable segments carrier networks division and enterprise networks division 
we review customer contracts to determine if all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met prior to recording revenues from sales transactions 
we generally record sales revenue upon shipment of our products  net of any rebates or discounts  since i we generally do not have significant post delivery obligations  ii the product price is fixed or determinable  iii collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and iv product returns are reasonably estimable 
we generally ship products upon receipt of a purchase order from a customer 
we evaluate shipping terms and we record revenue on products shipped in accordance with the applicable terms of each respective contract  generally fob shipping point 
in the case of consigned inventory  revenue is recognized when the customer assumes the risks and rewards of ownership of the product 
when contracts contain multiple elements  contract interpretation is sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting  including whether the deliverables specified in a multiple element contract should be treated as separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and  if so  how the price should be allocated among the elements and when to recognize revenue for each element 
we record revenue associated with installation services when the installation and all contractual obligations are complete 
when contracts include both installation and product sales  the installation is considered as a separate deliverable item 
either the purchaser  adtran  or a third party can perform installation of our products 
sales returns are accrued based on historical sales return experience  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of future returns 
the majority of enterprise networks products are sold in the united states through a non exclusive distribution network of major technology distributors 
these organizations then distribute to an extensive network of value added resellers and system integrators 
value added resellers and system integrators may be affiliated with us as a channel partner  or they may purchase from the distributor in an unaffiliated fashion 
additionally  our distributors may return unused and unopened product for stock balancing purposes when these returns are accompanied by offsetting orders for products of equal or greater value 
we participate in cooperative advertising and market development programs with certain customers 
we use these programs to reimburse customers for certain forms of advertising  and in general  to allow our customers credits up to a specified percentage of their net purchases 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we also participate in rebate programs to provide sales incentives for certain products 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale and are recorded as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
prior to accepting a new customer  we perform a detailed credit review of the customer 
credit limits are established for each new customer based on the results of this credit review 
payment terms are established for each new customer  and collection experience is reviewed periodically in order to determine if the customer s payment terms and credit limits need to be revised 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make 
table of contents required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we may be required to make additional allowances 
if circumstances change with regard to individual receivable balances that have previously been determined to be uncollectible and for which a specific reserve has been established  a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was million at december  and million at december  we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we use standard costs for material  labor  and manufacturing overhead to value our inventory 
our standard costs are updated on a monthly basis and any variances are expensed in the current period  therefore  our inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to make additional inventory write downs 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
inventory write downs charged to the reserve were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the objective of our short term investment policy is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity with appropriate diversification  while emphasizing market returns on our monetary assets 
the objective of our long term investment policy is principal preservation and total return  that is  the aggregate return from capital appreciation  dividend income  and interest income 
these objectives are achieved through investments with appropriate diversification in fixed and variable rate income securities  public equity  and private equity portfolios 
we have experienced significant volatility in the market prices of our publicly traded equity investments 
these investments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the ultimate realized value on these equity investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 
we review our investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  significant declines in value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognize and record the appropriate charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  we take into consideration qualitative and quantitative information  including but not limited to the following the magnitude and duration of historical decline in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity  public filings  and statements made by the issuer 
we generally begin our identification of potential other than temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a market value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by for more than six months 
we then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write down  if any 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we also invest in privately held entities and private equity funds and record these investments at cost 
we review these investments periodically in order to determine if circumstances both financial and non financial exist that indicate that we will not recover our initial investment 
impairment charges are recorded on investments having a cost basis that is greater than the value that we would reasonably expect to receive in an arm s length sale of the investment 
in we recorded a write down of our cost basis investments of million 
this write down is included in net realized investment gains losses in the accompanying consolidated statement of income 
for purposes of determining estimated fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payments  sfas r  we use the black scholes model 
this model requires the input of certain assumptions that require subjective judgment 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
because our stock based payment awards have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  the existing models may not provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our stock based payment awards 
management will continue to assess the assumptions and methodologies used to calculate estimated fair value of stock based compensation 
circumstances may change and additional data may become available over time  which could result in changes to these assumptions and methodologies and thereby materially impact our fair value determination 
if factors change and we use different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 

table of contents we estimate our income tax provision or benefit in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including estimating exposures related to examinations by taxing authorities 
we also make judgments regarding the realization of deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets is based on our belief that it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in certain jurisdictions to realize these deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets which we do not believe meet the more likely than not criteria established by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
our estimates regarding future taxable income and income tax provision or benefit may vary due to changes in market conditions  changes in tax laws  or other factors 
if our assumptions  and consequently our estimates  change in the future  the valuation allowances we have established may be increased or decreased  impacting future income tax expense 
for  and  the valuation allowance was million  million and million  respectively 
this valuation allowance is included in non current deferred tax liabilities in the accompanying balance sheets 
our products generally include warranties of one to ten years for product defects 
we accrue for warranty returns based on our estimate of the cost to repair or replace the defective products at the time revenue is recognized 
we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers 
our products continue to become more complex in both size and functionality as many of our product offerings migrate from line card applications to systems products 
these products will require more warranty repairs to be completed at the installed location due to their size and complexity  rather than at a manufacturing site or repair depot 
this field service obligation  as well as the increasing complexity of our products  will cause warranty incidences  when they arise  to be more costly 
our estimates regarding future warranty obligations may change due to product failure rates  material usage  and other rework costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
in addition  from time to time  specific warranty accruals may be recorded if unforeseen problems arise 
should our actual experience relative to these factors be worse than our estimates  we will be required to record additional warranty expense 
alternatively  if we provide for more reserves than we require  we will reverse a portion of such provisions in future periods 
the liability for warranty returns totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
these liabilities are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets

the industry has integrated the functionality of csu dsus  which are hardware units that terminate carrier services at the enterprise location  into access routers  thereby reducing the requirement for a standalone csu dsu 
the decrease in iad product revenues is primarily related to a decline in average selling prices due to the consolidation of the clec market 
international sales  which are included in the carrier networks and enterprise networks amounts discussed above  decreased from million in to million in the decrease in international sales is primarily attributable to a major customer s completion in of the initial phase of a new network build out of a particular service

we continually evaluate new product opportunities and engage in intensive research and product development efforts 
we frequently invest heavily in up front new product development efforts prior to the actual commencement of sales of a major new product 
to date  we have expensed all product research and development costs as incurred 
as a result  we may incur significant research and development expenses prior to the receipt of revenues from a major new product group 

table of contents we are presently incurring research and development expenses in connection with new products and expansion into international markets

this contingency was resolved in as accrued 
income taxes although our effective tax rate remained relatively constant at in compared to in  there were fluctuations in the components of the rate 
an increase in tax exempt income resulted in a percentage point decrease in the current year effective rate 
this was substantially offset by the affect of an increase in stock based compensation expense relating to the implementation of sfas r  and an increase in the rate relating to provisions for state income taxes 
net income as a result of the above factors  net income decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  net income decreased from in to in compared to sales adtran s sales increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily the result of increasing unit volume and market share gains in the carrier networks division

cost of sales cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  decreased from in to in the decrease is primarily related to manufacturing efficiencies  the timing differences between the recognition of cost reductions and the lowering of product selling prices  and the sales of higher margin new products 
in addition  the decrease resulted from improvements in supply chain management  due to the implementation of an advanced planning system and a web based procurement process  which has reduced cycle times and increased our manufacturing flexibility 
we anticipate that continued deployment of supply chain applications augmented with process improvement strategies will result in further cost reductions  which we believe will provide a continued competitive advantage

pursuant to the program  on january   the authority issued million of its taxable revenue bonds and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to adtran 
the bonds were originally purchased by amsouth bank of alabama  birmingham  alabama  the bank 
wachovia bank  na  nashville  tennessee formerly first union national bank of tennessee  nashville  tennessee the bondholder purchased the original bonds from the bank and made further advances to the authority  bringing the total amount outstanding to million 
the incentive program enables participating companies to generate alabama corporate income tax credits that can be used to reduce the amount of alabama corporate income taxes that would otherwise be payable  in exchange for investing capital and creating jobs in alabama 
we cannot be certain that the state of alabama will continue to make these corporate income tax credits available  therefore  we may not realize the full benefit of these incentives 
through december   the authority had issued million of its taxable revenue bonds pursuant to the incentive program and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to adtran

dividends per common share first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter at december  and  we held million and million  respectively  of auction rate municipal bonds classified as available for sale short term investments 
our investments in these securities are recorded at cost  which approximates fair market value due to their variable interest rates  which typically reset every seven  or days 
despite the long term nature of their stated contractual maturities  we have the ability to quickly liquidate these securities 
as a result  we had no cumulative gross unrealized holding gains losses or gross realized gains losses from these investments 
all income generated from these investments was recorded as interest income

the decreases in each of these ratios from to are primarily due to the decrease in cash and short term investments at december  the decrease in cash and short term investments at december  is primarily attributable to our share repurchase program 
for the year  we repurchased  shares for a total cost of million  as discussed in more detail below 
at december   we had an income tax receivable of million primarily related to overpayment of estimated taxes  as a result of retroactive federal research and development tax credits that were passed late in the year 
at december   we had an income tax payable of million primarily related to current year taxable income 
we receive an income tax deduction for the difference between the exercise price of an option and the market price of the underlying common stock upon exercise by employees 
we recorded million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  as an income tax benefit in connection with non qualified stock option exercises and disqualifying dispositions of incentive stock options 
at december   cash on hand was million and short term investments were million  which placed our short term liquidity at million 
at december   our cash on hand of million and short term investments of million placed our short term liquidity at million 
short term investments at december  include million related to our deferred compensation plan

accounts receivable decreased from million at december  to million at december  quarterly days sales outstanding increased four days from days as of december  to days as of december  other receivables increased from december  to december   primarily resulting from timing and fluctuations of payments from subcontractors 
quarterly inventory turnover decreased from turns as of december  to turns as of december  inventory increased from december  to december  due to increases in raw materials and delays in carrier spending 
accounts payable increased from million at december  to million at december  this increase is primarily related to variations of the timing of our payments 
accrued expenses decreased  or million  from december  to december  primarily due to the decrease in warranty reserves and the settlement of a litigation contingency 
capital expenditures totaled approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenditures were primarily used to purchase computer hardware and software and manufacturing and test equipment

table of contents effect of recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payments  sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
sfas r requires measurement of compensation cost for all stock based awards at fair value on the grant date and recognition of compensation expense over the requisite service period for awards expected to vest 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  adtran recorded the intrinsic value of stock based compensation as expense  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
 and related interpretations  as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation expense sfas 
under the intrinsic value method  no material amount of stock based compensation expense had been recorded in our consolidated statements of income prior to january   because the exercise price of our stock options granted equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
sfas allowed us to recognize forfeitures as they occur  while sfas r requires us to estimate future forfeitures and adjust our estimate on a regular basis 
as such  we evaluated the need to record a cumulative effect adjustment for estimated forfeitures upon the adoption of sfas r 
because this adjustment only applies to the extent that compensation cost was previously recognized for the unvested awards  no cumulative effect adjustment was recorded upon adoption 
sfas r requires cash flows resulting from the tax deductions in excess of the related compensation cost recognized in the financial statements excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
in accordance with sfas r  excess tax benefits recognized in periods after the adoption date have been properly classified as financing cash flows 
excess tax benefits recognized in periods prior to the adoption date are classified as operating cash flows 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force in issue no 
eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the scope of eitf includes any tax assessed by a governmental authority that is directly imposed on a revenue producing activity between a seller and a customer  and may include  but is not limited to  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
eitf concluded that the presentation of taxes within its scope on either a gross included in revenue and cost or net excluded from revenues basis is an accounting policy decision subject to appropriate disclosure 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we currently present these taxes on a gross basis and will begin the required disclosures of these taxes in fiscal in july  the fasb released fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertain tax positions as described in sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and requires a company to recognize  in its financial statements  the impact of a tax position only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on an audit basis solely on the technical merit of the position 
in addition  fin requires qualitative and quantitative disclosures including a discussion of reasonably possible changes that might occur in the recognized tax benefits over the next twelve months as well as a roll forward of all unrecognized tax benefits 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   we will adopt fin as of january  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
under sfas  fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact sfas might have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
we applied the provisions of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal and there was no impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition
