overview cabot microelectronics corporation cabot microelectronics  the company  us  we  or our is the leading supplier of high performance polishing slurries used in the manufacture of advanced integrated circuit ic devices within the semiconductor industry  in a process called chemical mechanical planarization cmp 
cmp is a polishing process used by ic device manufacturers to planarize or flatten many of the multiple layers of material that are built upon silicon wafers in the production of advanced ics 
demand for our cmp products is primarily based on the number of wafers produced by semiconductor manufacturers  or wafer starts 
we operate predominantly in one industry segment the development  manufacture and sale of cmp consumables 
we develop  produce and sell cmp slurries for polishing materials such as copper  tungsten and dielectric in ic devices  and also for polishing the coatings on disks in hard disk drives and magnetic heads 
in addition  we develop  produce and sell cmp polishing pads  which are used in conjunction with slurries in the cmp process 
we continue to focus on our three strategic initiatives within our core cmp business maintaining our technological leadership  achieving operations excellence and connecting with our customers 
in fiscal  we introduced major improvements in several slurry products and we commercialized our new polishing pad product 
we continued to make productivity and efficiency gains through our six sigma program and we advanced our quality systems to improve the uniformity and consistency of performance of our cmp products 
we further expanded our presence in asia with the introduction of pad manufacturing in taiwan  as well as additions to our research and development facilities in order to improve our responsiveness to customers 
we believe that the semiconductor industry and the cmp consumables industry will continue to grow over the long term 
we expect this growth to be fueled by increased demand for ic devices  including microprocessors and memory for computing applications and the incorporation of advanced logic and memory products into digital consumer devices 
we also believe there is increased pressure on ic device manufacturers to reduce their costs  particularly the cost of developing and producing ic devices for consumer electronic products 
in turn  this puts pressure on suppliers to the ic device manufacturers to offer lower cost solutions 
as demand grows  we see numerous opportunities for our existing slurry products as well as demand for new slurry product development 
we also see numerous opportunities for our polishing pads in all major cmp application areas  and across a wide range of technology nodes 
there are many factors  however  that make it difficult for us to predict future revenue trends for our cmp business  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  timing of potential future acquisitions  short order to delivery time for our products and the associated lack of visibility to future customer orders  and quarter to quarter changes in our revenue regardless of industry strength 

table of contents in addition to strengthening and growing our core cmp business  through our engineered surface finishes esf business we are exploring a variety of surface modification applications where we believe our technical ability to shape  enable and enhance the performance of surfaces at an atomic level may provide previously unseen surface performance or improved productivity 
in pursuit of our esf business  in fiscal  we acquired substantially all of the assets and assumed certain current liabilities of qed technologies  inc qed  which was a privately held company specializing in unique  patented polishing and metrology systems for shaping and polishing high precision optics 
we successfully integrated qed into our company in fiscal revenue for fiscal was million  which was an increase of from the million reported for fiscal this increase was largely due to a full year of revenue from qed 
our fiscal financial results also reflected the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
we believe our revenue in the first half of the fiscal year was adversely impacted as a number of our customers reduced production in response to excess inventories of certain semiconductor devices 
the industry experienced improved conditions in the second half of the fiscal year when there was an upturn in business for the major foundries in asia  from which a significant part of our revenue is derived  which contributed to our stronger financial performance 
gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue for fiscal was  which represents an increase from the reported for fiscal the increase was primarily driven by a higher valued product mix and improvements in productivity and quality 
this was partially offset by lower utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to lower volume of sales  primarily in the first half of the fiscal year 
we expect to maintain our gross profit as a percentage of revenue in the range of to for fiscal this guidance applies to our full fiscal year results rather than specific quarterly results  we may experience quarterly gross profit above or below this range due to fluctuations in our product mix or other factors 
operating expenses of million  which include research  development  technical  selling  marketing  general and administrative expenses  increased  or million  from the million reported for fiscal the increase was primarily due to higher staffing costs associated with the acquisition of the qed business and increased share based compensation expenses  as well as higher professional and legal fees 
the increase in operating expenses was partially offset by the absence of million of one time write offs in research and development incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal in fiscal  we expect our operating expenses to be in the range of approximately million to million per quarter  unchanged from the guidance we provided for fiscal diluted earnings per share of in fiscal increased  or  from fiscal diluted earnings per share in fiscal was adversely impacted by approximately due to a write down of our minority equity investment in nanoproducts corporation npc  due to our decision to not renew our collaboration arrangement with npc and npc s entering into funding arrangements that we believe significantly reduced the likelihood that we would recover the value of our investment 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as disclosures included elsewhere in this form k  are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate the estimates used  including those related to bad debt expense  warranty obligations  inventory valuation  impairment of long lived assets and investments  business combinations  goodwill  other intangible assets  share based compensation  income taxes and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as for identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the potential inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical collection experience  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
while historical experience may provide a reasonable estimate of uncollectible accounts  actual results may differ from what was recorded 
as of september   our allowance for doubtful accounts represented of gross accounts receivable 
if we had increased our estimate of bad debts to of gross accounts receivable  our general and administrative expense would have increased by million 
warranty reserve we maintain a warranty reserve that reflects management s best estimate of the cost to replace product that does not meet customers specifications and performance requirements  and costs related to such replacement 
the warranty reserve is based upon a historical product replacement rate  adjusted for any specific known conditions or circumstances 
should actual warranty costs differ substantially from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
as of september   our warranty reserve represented of the current quarter revenue 
if we had increased our warranty reserve estimate to of the current quarter revenue  our cost of goods sold would have increased by million 
inventory valuation we value inventory at the lower of cost or market and write down the value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or if inventory is deemed unmarketable 
an inventory reserve is maintained based upon a historical percentage of actual inventories written off applied against the inventory value at the end of the period  adjusted for known conditions and circumstances 
we exercise judgment in estimating the amount of inventory that is obsolete 
should actual product marketability and fitness for use be affected by conditions that are different from those projected by management  revisions to the estimated inventory reserve may be required 
impairment of long lived assets and investments sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in this grouping 
sfas requires that when the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the identified asset group is less than the carrying value of the asset group  an impairment provision may be required 
the amount of the impairment to be recognized is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset group from the net book value of the asset group 
determining future cash flows and estimating fair values requires significant judgment and is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future sales and cost of sales generally over a long term period 
we evaluate the estimated fair value of investments annually or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if an other than temporary impairment in the value of the investment has taken place 

table of contents business combinations in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired entities to the tangible and intangible assets acquired  liabilities assumed  as well as in process research and development ipr d based on their estimated fair values 
we engage independent third party appraisal firms to assist us in determining the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired 
this valuation requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions  especially with respect to long lived and intangible assets 
critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets include but are not limited to future expected cash flows related to acquired developed technologies and patents and assumptions about the period of time the technologies will continue to be used in the combined company s product portfolio  expected costs to develop the ipr d into commercially viable products and estimated cash flows from the products when completed  and discount rates 
management s estimates of value are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable  but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur which may cause actual realized values to be different from management s estimates 
goodwill and other intangible assets purchased intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
goodwill and other intangible assets are tested annually in the fourth fiscal quarter or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
we determined that goodwill and other intangible assets were not impaired as of september  share based compensation effective october   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires all share based payments  including stock option grants  restricted stock and restricted stock unit awards and employee stock purchases  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
under sfas r  we calculate share based compensation expense using the straight line approach based on awards ultimately expected to vest  which requires the use of an estimated forfeiture rate 
our estimated forfeiture rate is primarily based on historical experience  but may be revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimate 
we continue to use the black scholes option pricing model black scholes model to estimate grant date fair value  which requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s expected term  the price volatility of the underlying stock and risk free interest rate 
a small change in the underlying assumptions can have a relatively large effect on the estimated valuation 
under sfas r  we estimate expected volatility based on a combination of our stock s historical volatility and the implied volatilities from actively traded options on our stock 
we use the simplified method to calculate the expected term as defined under staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 share based payments sab  due to our limited amount of historical option exercise data  and we add a slight premium to this expected term for employees who meet the definition of retirement pursuant to their grants during the contractual term 
this method uses an average of the vesting and contractual terms 
the risk free rate is derived from the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
prior to december   awards and grants made as part of our annual equity incentive award programs consisted solely of non qualified stock option grants 
in fiscal  the compensation committee of our board of directors decided to award a blend of non qualified stock options and shares of restricted stock to employees and non employee directors 
this decision was made to address the financial impact of expensing equity based compensation under the rules of sfas r  as well as to provide a more competitive balance of equity incentives for employees and non employee directors 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
we have determined that it is more likely than not that our future taxable income will be sufficient to realize our deferred tax assets 
commitments and contingencies we have entered into unconditional purchase obligations  which include noncancelable purchase commitments and take or pay arrangements with suppliers 
we review our agreements on a quarterly basis and make an assessment of the likelihood of a shortfall in purchases and determine if it is necessary to record a liability 
in addition  we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business such as a legal proceeding or claim 
an estimated loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted and whether new accruals are required 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of recent accounting pronouncements including the expected dates of adoption and effects on our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage of revenue of certain line items included in our historical statements of income year ended september  revenue cost of goods sold gross profit research  development and technical selling and marketing general and administrative purchased in process research and development operating income other income  net income before income taxes provision for income taxes net income year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal of this increase  million was contributed by qed and million was due to a higher average selling price for our slurry products 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease due to reduced sales volume in our core cmp business 
the higher average selling price for our slurry products resulted primarily from a higher priced product mix 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal of this increase  million was related to qed and was due to an increase in the average cost per unit of our slurry products 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease due to reduced sales volume in our core cmp business 
the higher average unit cost resulted primarily from lower utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the lower level of sales  primarily during the first half of the fiscal year  and higher fixed costs  partially offset by improvements in productivity and quality as well as benefits of a lower cost product mix 
fumed metal oxides  such as fumed silica and fumed alumina  are significant raw materials that we use in many of our cmp slurries 
in an effort to mitigate our risk to rising raw material costs and to increase supply assurance and quality performance requirements  we have entered into multi year supply agreements with a number of suppliers 
for more financial information about our supply contracts  see tabular disclosure of contractual obligations included in item of part ii of this form k 
our need for additional quantities or different kinds of key raw materials in the future has required  and will continue to require  that we enter into new supply arrangements with third parties 
future arrangements may result in costs which are different from those in the existing agreements 
in addition  rising energy costs may also impact the cost of raw materials  packaging and freight costs 
we also expect to continue to invest in our operations excellence initiative to improve product quality  reduce variability and improve product yields in our manufacturing process 

table of contents gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in fiscal and improved basis points from the level achieved in fiscal the increase in gross profit expressed as a percentage of revenue resulted primarily from a higher valued product mix and improvements in productivity and quality 
this was partially offset by lower utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the lower level of sales of our core cmp products  primarily in the first half of the fiscal year  as well as higher fixed costs 
we expect to maintain our gross profit as a percentage of revenue in the range of to for full fiscal year quarterly gross profit may be above or below this range due to fluctuations in our product mix or other factors 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase was primarily due to increased staffing related costs of million  largely resulting from the inclusion of qed for a full year in fiscal  increased depreciation and amortization costs of million principally related to our data storage laboratory in singapore and our asia pacific technology center in japan and increased professional fees of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in spending on wafers and laboratory supplies of million 
our research  development and technical efforts are focused on the following main areas research related to fundamental cmp technology  development and formulation of new and enhanced cmp consumable products  process development to support rapid and effective commercialization of new products  technical support of cmp products in our customers manufacturing facilities  and evaluation of new polishing applications outside of the semiconductor industry 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase resulted primarily from higher staffing costs of million  largely resulting from the inclusion of qed as well as expanding our presence in asia 
there were also smaller increases in costs for travel  professional fees and depreciation and amortization 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal the increase resulted primarily from million in higher staffing costs  including million in share based compensation expense  and a million increase in professional fees  including costs to enforce our intellectual property 
purchased in process research and development we incurred no ipr d expenses in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  since we did not make any acquisitions in fiscal we may make future acquisitions and may record additional expenses for ipr d in connection with those acquisitions 

table of contents other income  net other income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a million impairment of our equity investment in npc  following a decision to not renew a collaboration agreement 
this decrease was partially offset by an increase of million in interest income on our cash and short term investments  mostly due to higher interest rates  a decrease in interest expense of million related to capital leases  and the absence of million of expenses related to our investment in npc that we recognized in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to higher tax exempt interest income and increased research and experimentation tax credits 
we expect our effective tax rate in fiscal to be approximately percent 
net income net income was million in fiscal  which represented an increase of  or million  from fiscal as a result of the factors discussed above 
year ended september   versus year ended september  revenue revenue was million in  which represented an  or million  increase from of this increase  million was due to an increase in sales volume and million was related to our july acquisition of qed  these increases were partially offset by a net million decrease due to the change in weighted average selling price 
the decrease in weighted average selling price primarily resulted from selected price reductions largely offset by a higher priced product mix 
selling prices were also affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
revenue for fiscal would have been million higher had the average exchange rates for the japanese yen and euro during the year held constant with the prior year s average rates 
revenue increased in fiscal despite our transition to selling directly to customers in taiwan rather than through a distributor  which caused a short term interruption in our normal sales pattern during our second quarter of fiscal between million and million 
however  after this transition period  we believe we were able to gain a portion of the markup that our distributor previously charged its end customers  which partially offset the adverse revenue impact from the transition 
cost of goods sold total cost of goods sold was million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from of this increase  million was due to higher sales volume  million was related to our acquisition of qed and million was due to higher average costs per unit 
the average cost per unit increased primarily due to a higher cost product mix  higher fixed costs  including amortization of our cmp technology patents from ibm  and greater logistics costs as a result of our transition to direct sales in taiwan 
these costs were partially offset by higher utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the higher level of sales 

table of contents gross profit our gross profit as a percentage of revenue was in as compared to in the basis point decrease in gross profit margin resulted primarily from selected price reductions and higher costs including those associated with commercializing our pad product line and the transition of our data storage business to singapore 
these adverse effects were partially offset by higher utilization of our manufacturing capacity due to the higher level of sales 
research  development and technical total research  development and technical expenses were million in  which represented an increase of or million  from the increase was primarily related to million in increased staffing costs  million in increased depreciation and million in impairment expense 
the increased staffing costs included million in higher expenses for our annual incentive program related to our research  development and technical staff as well as million in share based compensation expense 
the increased depreciation expense was primarily related to the october opening of our asia pacific technology center in geino  japan 
the impairment expense was attributable to the decision to no longer use the portion of a building in aurora  illinois  that was previously used for research and development activities 
these increases were partially offset by million in decreased costs for clean room materials and laboratory supplies 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  over the increase resulted primarily from higher staffing costs of million  including million in share based compensation expense and million in higher expense for our annual incentive program related to our sales and marketing staff 
another million of the increase was due to increased travel to the asia pacific region as we implemented a number of projects in support of our strategic initiative to stay connected with our customers  such as transitioning to direct sales in taiwan and moving our data storage business to singapore 
selling and marketing expenses also increased million due to higher office rental fees and million related to increased product sample costs 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from the increase resulted primarily from million in higher staffing costs  including million in share based compensation expense and million in higher expense for our annual incentive program 
purchased in process research and development purchased ipr d expense was million in  resulting from the acquisition of substantially all of the assets and assumption of certain liabilities of qed 
other income  net other income was million in  compared to million in the increase in other income was primarily due to million greater interest income from higher interest rates and our larger average balance of cash and short term investments  partially offset by million of expense associated with our investment in nanoproducts corporation 

table of contents provision for income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to reduced research and experimentation tax credits 
in addition  we recognized reduced extraterritorial income tax deductions related to export sales of our products from north america due to the phase out of this tax benefit 
net income net income was million in  which represented an increase of  or million  from as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash flows from operating activities of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal our cash provided by operating activities in fiscal originated primarily from results of operations adjusted for non cash items  partially offset by a net increase in working capital of million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities during fiscal was primarily due to higher depreciation expense and increased share based compensation expenses 
the increase in depreciation expense was primarily due to capital expenditures related to our asia pacific technology center  which opened in fiscal fiscal cash flows used in investing activities were million 
we used million for net purchases of short term investments 
purchases of property  plant and equipment  including the expansion of our pad manufacturing capabilities in the us and taiwan as well as purchases for qed  were million 
we also used million to acquire a license of patents and we paid million for the first of two potential earnout payments to the previous owners of qed  related to its revenue performance during the months following our acquisition 
see note and note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for more information on business combinations and intangible assets 
in fiscal  cash flows used in investing activities were million  which included million for purchases of property  plant and equipment  primarily for the construction of our asia pacific technology center and for projects in our manufacturing operations 
we also completed two acquisitions during fiscal for a total of million  net of cash acquired 
in addition  we used million to acquire patents and associated rights relating to cmp slurry technology 
finally  million was provided by net sales of short term investments 
fiscal cash flows used in investing activities were million 
purchases of property  plant and equipment  primarily for the construction of our asia pacific technology center and other manufacturing projects  were made with million in cash and million in accrued liabilities 
in addition  million was used for net purchases of short term investments and million was used for the final payment for our acquisition of a minority ownership interest in nanoproducts corporation 
we estimate that our total capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million 
in fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities were million 
this resulted from million in purchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and million in principal payments under capital lease obligations  partially offset by million in net proceeds from the issuance of stock  primarily from the exercise of stock options under our second amended and restated cabot microelectronics corporation equity incentive plan  as amended and restated september  in fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities were million  primarily as a result of million in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and million in principal payments under capital lease obligations 
these outflows were partially offset by million from the issuance of common stock  primarily associated with our cabot microelectronics corporation employee stock purchase plan 
in fiscal  cash flows used in financing activities were million  primarily resulting from million in repurchases of common stock under our share repurchase program and million in principal payments under capital lease obligations  partially offset by million from the issuance of common stock associated with the exercise of stock options under our equity incentive plan and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we completed our initial million share repurchase program  which was authorized in july in october  our board of directors authorized another share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock 
shares are repurchased from time to time  depending on market conditions  in open market transactions  at management s discretion 
we fund share repurchases from our existing cash balance 
we view the program as a flexible and effective means to return cash to stockholders 
the program became effective on the authorization date and may be suspended or terminated at any time  at the company s discretion 
there was million remaining on this authorization as of september  
table of contents we have an unsecured revolving credit facility of million with an option to increase the facility up to million 
this agreement runs through november  but we expect to have a new agreement in place prior to its expiration in fiscal interest accrues on any outstanding balance at either the lending institution s base rate or the eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin 
we also pay a non use fee 
loans under this facility are intended to be used primarily for general corporate purposes  including working capital and capital expenditures 
the credit agreement also contains various covenants 
no amounts are currently outstanding under this credit facility and we believe we are currently in compliance with the covenants 
we believe that cash generated by our operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations  expected capital expenditures  including merger and acquisition activities  and share repurchases for the foreseeable future 
however  we plan to expand our business and continue to improve our technology  and to do so may require us to raise additional funds in the future through equity or debt financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
off balance sheet arrangements at september  and  we did not have any unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which might have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents tabular disclosure of contractual obligations the following summarizes our contractual obligations at september   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
contractual obligations less than after in millions total year years years years capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual obligations capital lease obligations in december  we entered into a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation under which we agreed to pay cabot corporation for the expansion of a fumed alumina manufacturing facility in tuscola  illinois 
the payments for the facility have been treated as a capital lease for accounting purposes and the present value of the minimum quarterly payments resulted in an initial million lease obligation and related leased asset 
the initial term of the agreement expired in december  but it was renewed for another five year term ending in december operating leases we lease certain vehicles  warehouse facilities  office space  machinery and equipment under cancelable and noncancelable operating leases  most of which expire within ten years of their respective commencement dates and may be renewed by us 
purchase obligations we have entered into multi year supply agreements with cabot corporation for the purchase of fumed metal oxides 
we purchase fumed silica primarily under a fumed silica supply agreement with cabot corporation that became effective in january  and was amended in september the agreement has an initial six year term that runs through december and will automatically renew unless either party gives certain notice of non renewal 
we are obligated to purchase fumed silica for at least of our six month volume forecast for certain of our slurry products  to purchase certain non material minimum quantities every six months  and to pay for the shortfall if we purchase less than these amounts 
we currently anticipate meeting all minimum forecasted purchase volume requirements 
since december  we have purchased fumed alumina primarily under a fumed alumina supply agreement with cabot corporation that has an original term ending in december and was renewed for another five year term ending in december prices charged for fumed alumina from cabot corporation are pursuant to the terms of the supply agreement and may fluctuate based upon the actual costs incurred by cabot corporation in the manufacture of fumed alumina 
under these agreements  cabot corporation continues to be the exclusive supplier of certain quantities and types of fumed silica and fumed alumina for certain products we produced as of the effective dates of these agreements 
subject to certain terms  these agreements prohibit cabot corporation from selling fumed silica and fumed alumina to third parties for use in cmp applications  as well as engaging itself in cmp applications 
if cabot corporation fails to supply us with our requirements for any reason  including if we require product specification changes that cabot corporation cannot meet  we have the right to purchase products meeting those specifications from other suppliers 
we also may purchase fumed alumina and fumed silica from other suppliers for certain products  including those commercialized after the effective dates of these agreements 
purchase obligations include an aggregate amount of million of contractual commitments related to our cabot corporation agreements for fumed silica and fumed alumina 
in addition to the million in cash we paid at closing related to our july qed acquisition  we paid another million based on the revenue performance of the qed business in the months following its acquisition  and we may be obligated to pay up to an additional million depending upon the revenue performance of the qed business in the second month period following the acquisition 
contractual obligations at september   include million in contingent payments related to this agreement  with the assumption that we will pay the maximum amount 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk effect of currency exchange rates and exchange rate risk management we conduct business operations outside of the united states through our foreign operations 
some of our foreign operations maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  period to period comparability of results of operations is affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
the primary currencies to which we have exposure are the japanese yen and  to a lesser extent  the british pound and the euro 
from time to time we enter into forward contracts in an effort to manage foreign currency exchange exposure 
however  we may be unable to hedge these exposures completely 
approximately of our revenue is transacted in currencies other than the us dollar 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
market risk and sensitivity analysis related to foreign exchange rate risk we have performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical adverse movement in foreign exchange rates 
as of september   the analysis demonstrated that such market movements would not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows over a one year period 
actual gains and losses in the future may differ materially from this analysis based on changes in the timing and amount of foreign currency rate movements and our actual exposures
