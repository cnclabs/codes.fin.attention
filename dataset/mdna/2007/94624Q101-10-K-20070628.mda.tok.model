item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the consolidated financial statements include wayne savings bancshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  wayne savings community bank 
intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s net earnings are primarily dependent on its net interest income  which is the difference between interest income earned on its loan  mortgage backed securities and investment portfolios  and its cost of funds  consisting of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
the company s net earnings also are affected by its provision for losses on loans  as well as the amount of other income  including trust fees and service charges  and general  administrative and other expense  such as salaries and employee benefits  deposit insurance premiums  occupancy and equipment costs  and income taxes 
earnings of the company also are affected significantly by general economic and competitive conditions  particularly changes in market interest rates  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
business strategy the company s current business strategy is to operate a well capitalized  profitable and community oriented bank dedicated to providing quality service and products to its customers 
the company has sought to implement this strategy in recent years by closely monitoring the needs of customers and providing personal  quality customer service  continuing the origination of a wide array of loan products in the company s market area  managing interest rate risk exposure by better matching asset and liability maturities and rates  increasing fee income  including the continuing growth of a trust department  managing asset quality  maintaining a strong retail deposit base  maintaining capital in excess of regulatory requirements  and emphasizing the commercial loan program to add high quality  higher yielding assets to the company s loan portfolio 
discussion of financial condition changes from march  to march in addition to the historical information contained herein  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
economic circumstances  the company s operations  and actual results could differ significantly from those discussed in forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are discussed herein but also include changes in the economy and interest rates in the nation and the company s general market area 
the forward looking statements contained herein include  but are not limited to  those with respect to the following matters management s determination of the amount and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  the effect of changes in interest rates  management s opinion as to the effects of recent accounting pronouncements on the company s consolidated financial statements  and management s opinion as to the bank s ability to maintain regulatory capital at current levels 
the company considers the allowance for loan losses and related loss provision to be a critical accounting policy 
a detailed discussion as to the application of such policy is set forth on the following pages 

index discussion of financial condition changes from march  to march  continued at march   the company reported total assets of million  an increase of million  or  over the million total at march  cash  interest bearing deposits and investment securities decreased by million  or  to million at march   mainly due to a reduction in investment securities  as securities totaling million matured and million were sold during fiscal the proceeds from these investments were used to fund growth in loans and mortgage based securities and the million increase in federal funds sold 
mortgage backed securities increased by million  or  to million  at march   as purchases of million of these securities were partially offset by principal repayments totaling million 
during the fiscal year ended march   loans receivable increased by million  or  as the bank originated and retained million of loans and received payments of million 
rather than reinvest funds from repayments on loans in long term  fixed rate and lower yielding residential loans  the lending division has been able to originate shorter term adjustable rate commercial loans 
the company believes that investing in shorter term and adjustable rate commercial loans positions the company favorably in the current interest rate environment 
the composition of the loan portfolio continued to evolve during the fiscal year ended march   as exemplified by a net decrease of million in residential and construction mortgage loans  which were more than offset by increases in nonresidential real estate loans of million and a net increase in commercial loans of million 
at both march  and  the allowance for loan losses totaled million  or of loans 
in determining the amount of loan loss allowance at any point of time  management and the board apply a systematic process of focusing on the risk of loss in the portfolio 
first  delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans are evaluated for potential impairment in carrying value 
at march   all delinquent nonresidential  multi family and commercial loans were viewed as well secured  with no material loss anticipated 
the second step in determining the allowance for loan losses entails the application of historic loss experience to individual loan types in the portfolio 
in addition to the historic loss percentage  management employs an additional risk percentage tailored to the board s and management s perception of the overall risk in the economy 
finally  to provide additional assurance regarding the validity of the commercial loan risk rating system  management engages a third party loan reviewer who provides independent validation of the bank s loan grading process 
due primarily to the growth of the nonresidential real estate and the commercial loan portfolio  management provided  to the allowance for loan losses during fiscal deposits totaled million at march   an increase of  or over the million total at march   generally reflecting the bank s competitive deposit pricing in all market areas 
money market investor accounts grew by million as management introduced a interest rate product in a promotion initiated to attract new depositors 
certificates of deposit increased by million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in savings accounts of million and a decrease of million in now accounts 
the increase in the money market and certificate of deposit accounts carried a much higher cost of funds compared to the savings and now account decreases  contributing to the basis point increase in the cost of deposits to the march  level of compared to at march  borrowings remained relatively unchanged at million at march  as compared with million at march  
index discussion of financial condition changes from march  to march  continued stockholders equity totaled million  a decrease of million  or  during the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to purchases of treasury stock totaling million  dividends totaling million and an increase in the accumulated comprehensive loss arising from the sfas no 
pension adjustment of  these amounts were partially offset by million in net earnings for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of  in accumulated comprehensive losses related to the unrealized losses on available for sale securities and from stock option exercises totaling  comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and general net earnings totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of  or  when compared to the net earnings of million for the fiscal year ended march  the increase in net earnings was primarily attributable to a decrease in general  administrative and other expense of million  or  coupled with a decrease in the provision for losses on loans of  which were partially offset by a  decrease in net interest income and an  decrease in other income 
interest income interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal this increase was mainly due to an increase in the weighed average yield on interest earning assets to in fiscal from for fiscal  and an increase in the average outstanding balance of million  or 
the yield increase was primarily due to the federal reserve raising the federal funds rate basis points over the past year 
these rate increases have beneficially affected the yields earned on the company s investment securities and interest earning deposits 
the company has purposefully invested excess funds in shorter term securities and adjustable rate loans rather than long term fixed rate loans 
although this strategy can sacrifice short term income  it strengthens the company s interest rate risk position and allows the company to profitably redeploy such assets in a rising interest rate environment 
interest income on loans increased by million  or  for the fiscal year ended march   compared to the same period in  due primarily to a million  or  increase in the average balance of loans outstanding year over year  coupled with a basis point increase in the weighted average yield on loans outstanding 
the increase in the average balance of loans was primarily due to the emphasis on nonresidential and commercial loans 
interest income on mortgage backed securities increased by million  or  during fiscal  compared to fiscal  due primarily to an increase of basis points in the weighted average yield to  compared to in the comparable period  generally reflecting the increase in market interest rates over fiscal and  coupled with an increase of million  or  in the average balance outstanding year to year 

index comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and continued interest income on investment securities decreased by  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting a decrease in the average balance of million  or  to million in fiscal from million during fiscal  which was partially offset by an increase in the weighted average yield of basis points to 
the decrease in the average volume reflects the company s strategy of managing interest rate risk by re investing investment portfolio maturities in mortgage backed securities which have a better yield and relatively shorter life than loans  when loan originations cannot keep pace with the cash flow produced by the investment portfolio 
interest income on interest earning deposits increased by  or  for the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to an increase in the weighted average yield of basis points to  coupled with an increase of million  or  in the average balance outstanding during fiscal interest expense interest expense totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of million  or  over fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from an increase in the weighted average cost of funds of basis points to for fiscal  coupled with an increase of million  or  in the average balance of deposits and borrowings outstanding in fiscal interest expense on deposits totaled million for fiscal  an increase of million  or  compared to fiscal the increase resulted from an increase of basis points in the weighted average cost of deposits to for fiscal  and an increase in the average balance outstanding of million  or 
as noted earlier  a shift in the composition of deposits from lower cost savings deposits to higher cost certificates of deposits contributed to the increase in the cost of deposits 
interest expense on borrowings totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   an increase of  or  from the period  due primarily to an increase in the average balance of million  or  and an increase in the weighted average cost of borrowings of basis points to for the fiscal year ended march  as a result of the repayment of lower rate advances 
net interest income net interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended march   a decrease of  or  from fiscal the average interest rate spread decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal the net interest margin decreased to for fiscal from for the fiscal year ended march  these ratios decreased as the increase in the yield on average interest earning assets of basis points was less than the basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
as noted earlier  a shift in the composition of deposits from lower cost savings deposits and now accounts to the higher cost of money market investor and certificates of deposit accounts contributed to the larger increase in the cost of deposits 
provision for losses on loans the company recorded a provision for losses on loans totaling  and  for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
to the best of management s knowledge  all known and inherent losses that are probable and which can be reasonably estimated have been recorded as of march  
index comparison of operating results for the years ended march  and continued other income other income  consisting primarily of an increase in cash surrender value of life insurance  trust income  service fees  and charges on deposit accounts  decreased by  or  to million for fiscal  from million for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease resulted primarily from a decrease in the cash surrender value of life insurance of  and the absence of  in gain on sale of loans 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in service fees  charges and other operating income of  or  and an increase in trust income of  or 
the decrease in cash surrender value of life insurance was the result of a cash payment received from the bank owned life insurance policy  causing the decrease in the average balance of these policies for the fiscal year ended march  the absence of gain on sale of loans was due to management s decision during fiscal to retain certain fixed rate mortgage loans to facilitate growth in the portfolio 
general  administrative and other expense general  administrative and other expense decreased by million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended march   compared to fiscal the decrease in general  administrative and other expense is primarily due to a reduction in employee compensation expense of  or  due to employee attrition coupled with management s initiative to enhance the bank s sales culture  the elimination of several positions and the absence of expenses associated with the death of the company s former chairman  president and chief executive officer and the retirement of the company s former executive vice president and chief operating officer 
franchise tax expense was reduced by  or  mainly due to a receivable from an amendment of prior returns coupled with the benefits of the treasury stock repurchase program from the prior year 
a decrease of  or  in other operating expense was primarily attributable to decreased advertising and public relations costs of  and reduced professional  legal and audit expenses of  which were partially offset by an increase in internet costs of  these decreases were offset by an increase of  or  in occupancy and equipment expense which was primarily due to increased data line costs related to the online banking program  coupled with an increase of depreciation expense  building related maintenance and real estate taxes increases 
federal income taxes federal income tax expense was  for the fiscal year ended march   reflecting an increase of  or  over fiscal the increase resulted primarily from a  or  increase in pre tax earnings 
the effective tax rates for fiscal and were and  respectively 
the difference in the effective tax rate from the statutory rate is mainly due to the beneficial effects of income from cash surrender value of life insurance and other tax exempt obligations

the increase in the average balance of loans was primarily due to the emphasis on origination of nonresidential and commercial loans 
interest income on mortgage backed securities decreased by  or  during fiscal  compared to fiscal  due primarily to a decrease of million  or  in the average balance due to principal prepayments 
the decrease in the average balance was offset by an increase of basis points in the weighted average yield to  as compared to  from the comparable period  generally reflecting upward interest rate adjustments in the rising rate environment 
interest income on investment securities increased by million  or  during fiscal compared to fiscal  reflecting an increase in the average balance of million  or  to million in fiscal from million during fiscal  coupled with an increase in the weighted average yield of basis points to 
the increase in the average volume reflects the company s strategy of investing in short term investment securities in the increasing interest rate environment 
this strategy provided the company with flexibility to use funds from securities sales and repayments to originate loans such as nonresidential and commercial loans with higher yields and in some instances shorter terms 
interest income on interest bearing deposits increased by  or  for the fiscal year ended march   due primarily to an increase in the weighted average yield of basis points to  partially offset by a reduction in the average balance during fiscal of million  or

while scheduled principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities are a relatively predictable source of funds  deposit flows and loan prepayments are greatly influenced by the general level of interest rates  economic conditions and competition 
the bank manages the pricing of deposits to maintain a desired level of deposits and cost of funds

the primary sources of cash are net earnings  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  proceeds from advances from the fhlb  maturities and sales of investment and mortgage backed securities 
liquidity management is both a daily and long term function of business management

impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto  presented elsewhere herein  have been prepared in accordance with us gaap  which requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of the company s operations 
unlike most industrial companies  nearly all the assets and liabilities of the company are monetary 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on the company s performance than do the effect of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis the bank  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the extent that interest earning assets reprice at a different time than interest bearing liabilities 
as part of their effort to monitor and manage interest rate risk  the bank uses the net portfolio value npv methodology adopted by the ots as part of its interest rate sensitivity regulations 
the application of npv methodology illustrates certain aspects of the bank s interest rate risk 
generally  npv is the discounted present value of the difference between incoming cash flows on interest earning and other assets and outgoing cash flows on interest bearing and other liabilities 
the application of the methodology attempts to quantify interest rate risk as the change in the npv  which would result from a theoretical change in market interest rates 

index asset and liability management interest rate sensitivity analysis continued presented below  as of march  and  is an analysis of the bank s interest rate risk as measured by changes in npv for instantaneous and sustained  and basis point basis point equals 
increases and a and basis point decrease in market interest rates 
due to the current interest rate environment  the changes in npv are not estimated for a decrease of basis points 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the npv approach 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
further  in the event of a change in interest rates  expected rates of prepayment on loans and mortgage backed securities and early withdrawal levels from certificates of deposit would likely deviate significantly from those assumed in making the risk calculations 
as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp bp bp bp bp bp bp as of march  net portfolio value change in net portfolio value as of pv of assets interest rates basis points amount change change npv ratio change in thousands bp bp bp bp bp bp bp the company s policy in recent years had been to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk generally by better matching the maturities of its interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities and by originating arm loans and other adjustable rate or short term loans  as well as by purchasing short term investments and mortgage backed securities 
however  particularly in the current interest rate environment  borrowers typically prefer fixed rate loans to arm loans 
accordingly  arm loan originations were very limited during the fiscal year ended march  the company has also sought to lengthen the maturities of its deposits by promoting longer term certificates  however  the company was not successful in lengthening the maturities of its deposits in the interest rate environment that existed throughout fiscal the company has an asset liability management committee alco  which is responsible for reviewing the company s asset liability policies 
the committee meets and reports monthly to the board of directors on interest rate risks and trends  as well as liquidity and capital ratios and requirements 
the bank has operated within the framework of its prescribed asset liability risk ranges for each of the last three years
