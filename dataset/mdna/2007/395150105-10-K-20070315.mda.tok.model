segment information our reportable segments are based on our operations in north america through greenfield online  inc  and its consolidated north american subsidiaries north america  and our operations in europe through ciao gmbh and its consolidated subsidiaries ciao or europe 
we have three reportable segments north american internet survey solutions  which operates through greenfield online  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries  ciao internet survey solutions  and ciao comparison shopping  which both operate in europe and the rest of the world through ciao 
our north american and ciao internet survey solutions segments conduct substantially similar businesses within a global marketplace  and the description of their businesses  market opportunities  customers  products and competitors is presented as a single business  except in circumstances where we believe that separate information related to a particular segment is necessary to understand our business as a whole 
while the comparison shopping business operated through our european operations was not a reportable segment for fiscal year  we are presenting certain information about this business because we believe it helps readers understand our business and our european operations as a whole 
in  we did not have the ability to prepare discrete financial information for the comparison shopping business  which could have been reviewed by management 
we now believe that it is important to track the results of our comparison shopping business separately 
we implemented financial systems during to allow us to prepare discrete financial information for use by our management and others to review the financial performance of our comparison shopping business 
we have reclassified certain prior period amounts to conform with the current period s presentation in order to prepare comparable segment results 
financial information about our reportable segments is included in our consolidated financial statements accompanying this annual report on form k

during the year ended december   we recorded approximately  in pre tax charges in connection with this rightsizing plan for costs and expenses primarily related to lease cancellation costs  which are included in restructuring charges in the consolidated statements of operations 
we will continue to evaluate the business and therefore  we may identify additional cost saving items that could result in additional charges for new initiatives  as well as changes in estimates to amounts previously recorded  as payments are made 
as such items are identified we will update our public filings as required to set forth an estimate of the costs associated therewith 
we conducted our initial review of goodwill and other intangible assets as of october  and determined that impairment existed 
we therefore  recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million related to goodwill  and a million pre tax impairment charge related to other intangible assets  for the year ended december  we conducted our annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets as of october  and determined that no impairment existed for the year ended december  explanation of key financial statement captions net revenues we report our revenues net of customer volume rebates and cash discounts 
discounts for larger customers typically range from to off of our standard rates and we typically limit volume rebates to a few customers 
historically  these rebates have not been material  nor do we expect them to be material in the near future 
our net revenues are derived primarily from the following offerings full service we program our clients surveys  host them on our website infrastructure  invite our panelists to take the surveys and deliver the compiled data to our clients for their analysis and presentation to their clients 
sample solutions clients that have their own programming capabilities  but have limited or no access to survey respondents  can purchase controlled access to our internet panels and real time tm sampling capability 
for our comparison shopping business  we generate revenues from e commerce commissions and advertising 
the core of this business consists of attracting visitors to our shopping portals  and referring these 
table of contents visitors to the websites of our online merchant clients 
whenever a visitor is referred from us to a client s website  a click through is recorded both by us and by the client 
at the end of each month  the total number of click throughs in that month is calculated  multiplied by the cost per click through agreed to contractually with the client  and the resulting sum is invoiced and recognized as revenue in that month 
advertising revenues are generated from the display of customer advertising on our ciao comparison shopping portals 
in this case  an advertising serving software is used to measure the number of page views that the advertising message has received in each month 
we and our advertising customers both have access to this software to verify the number of page views 
we only invoice and recognize revenues once an advertising campaign has been achieved in full  which occurs when the contractually agreed upon number of page views has been reached 
cost of revenues our direct costs associated with generating revenues primarily consist of the following items project personnel project personnel have three distinct roles project management  survey programming and data processing 
we maintain project personnel in the united states  europe  canada and india 
labor costs are specifically allocated to each project 
we utilize a timekeeping system in which project personnel maintain estimates of time incurred for each specific project 
project personnel are paid quarterly bonuses based upon service quality  achievement of revenue goals associated with clients 
panelist incentives our panelists receive cash and non cash incentives for participating in our surveys 
we maintain an incentive account for each member of our internet panels 
our panelists accrue incentives based upon a member qualifying for and completing a survey within a predetermined timeframe 
the panel member may request and receive payment of his or her incentives at any point in time prior to expiration 
in prior periods  incentives awarded would generally expire one year after a panelist becomes inactive as outlined in the terms and conditions available on our panelist website 
in february  in our north american internet survey solutions segment  we reduced the expiration threshold for panelists incentives from one year to six months of inactivity 
data processing we perform the majority of the processing of survey data with our own professionals 
occasionally  we outsource certain data processing functions to third party suppliers 
outside sample we supplement our sample with survey responses from individuals who are not members of our internet panels 
these situations occur where our internet panels cannot meet customer demands because of timing  capacity or demographic constraints  or when we are asked to supply survey responses in markets in which we do not have panelists  typically certain international geographic sectors 
real time sampling to supplement our north american internet based panels  we have developed and implemented our real time sampling capability 
real time sampling allows us to present an offer to take surveys to visitors at hundreds of websites  and if a visitor accepts this offer  he or she is then directed to proprietary software and screening techniques to match that individual to a survey project for which they are likely to qualify 
real time sampling broadens our potential pool of survey takers beyond our internet panelists  allowing us to reach individuals who may not want to join a panel  but are willing at certain points in time to share their opinions about topics that are relevant and important to them 
other direct costs other direct costs may include the following i fees paid to a third party for healthcare related sample data retrieved from a panel of healthcare professionals developed by this third party and ii in prior year periods  fees paid to microsoft corporation microsoft for surveys completed and sold using data from panelists we have obtained through the microsoft network msn 
for the year ended december   we included stock based compensation charges as a result of the adoption of sfas r on january  also included in other direct costs for years prior to is the amortization associated with the previously recorded unearned stock based 
table of contents compensation charges  which are amortized over the service period for options granted to project personnel 
amortization of internal use software we include in cost of revenues amortization of capitalized software costs related to survey production 
selling  general and administrative expenses as of december   we employed individuals that support the sales and marketing of our internet survey solutions 
these sales professionals are compensated based upon project delivery and revenue recognition 
commissions are accrued when we deliver completed projects to our clients 
in addition  we maintain our internet panels with a staff of panel management personnel 
these individuals design programs geared toward panelist recruitment  retention and incentives and are also responsible for panel database design and development 
furthermore  we support our internet survey solutions sales effort with a staff of marketing professionals who design product  pricing  promotional and distribution strategies 
as of december   we employed individuals who provide a foundation for these functions in the areas of executive  finance  human resources and information technology operations 
this group is responsible for maintaining the infrastructure and support for the entire sales  delivery and panel teams 
also included in selling  general and administrative expenses are unearned stock based compensation charges  which are amortized over the service period of options granted to selling  general and administrative personnel 
panel acquisition expenses we continually add new members to our internet panels in order to support growing demand for our products and services as well as to replace members who leave the panel in the ordinary course of our business 
we incur costs to acquire members for our panel  including fees paid to procure new panelists from our webmaster affiliate program and through panel acquisition agreements with large internet portals  special interest  age and ethnicity related websites 
we also incur costs related to testing potential panel sources before full recruitment roll outs begin on specific websites and other costs associated with the panel recruitment process 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
we may also add members to our internet panels by acquiring existing panels  as we did with our recent acquisitions 
in these cases  where we acquire the panel as part of an ongoing business  we are able to capitalize the fair value of the panel we acquire and amortize that fair value to operating expense over the estimated life of the acquired asset 
in connection with panel members acquired as a result of the opinionsurveys 
com  rapidata  gozing and ciao acquisitions  approximately million and million of amortization expense was included in panel acquisition expenses for the year ended december  and  respectively 
research and development expenses we employ a staff of professional technology personnel who develop proprietary solutions for panel database development  the development of internal use software and integrating client and third party software solutions into our technology infrastructure 
we also maintain a staff of professional technology personnel focused on the technology needs of our comparison shopping business in europe 
all costs associated with research and product development efforts are expensed as incurred and recorded under research and development expenses 
as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  costs relating to survey software development that meet the criteria for capitalization under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap are capitalized and amortized over the estimated period of benefit  usually two years

provision benefit for income taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities on differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
further  deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected realization of available net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to an amount that we expect to realize in the future 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize these benefits if a reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that these benefits will be realized 
in addition  we continuously evaluate our tax contingencies and recognize a liability when we believe that it is probable that a liability exists 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates on historical experience  independent instructions  known trends and events and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
for our internet survey solutions business  we recognize revenues for services when they are realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenues to be realized or realizable and earned when we have persuasive evidence of an arrangement  survey data delivery has occurred in accordance with the terms of the arrangement  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our products are delivered within a short period generally ranging from a few days to eight weeks 
an appropriate deferral is made for costs related to projects in process 
billings rendered in advance of services being performed  as well as customer deposits received in advance  are included in deferred revenue 
provision for estimated project losses  if any  is made in the period such losses are determined and estimable 
provision for rebates offered to certain customers are recorded against revenue in the period that such rebates are earned 
for our comparison shopping business  we generate revenues from e commerce commissions and advertising income 
the core of this business consists of attracting visitors to our comparison shopping portals  and referring these visitors to the websites of our merchant clients 
whenever a visitor is referred from us to a client s website  a click through is recorded both by us and by the client 
at the end of each month  the total number of click throughs in that month is calculated  multiplied by the cost per click through agreed contractually with the client  and the resulting sum is invoiced and recognized as revenue in that month 
advertising revenues are generated from the display of customer advertising on our ciao comparison shopping portals 
in this case  an advertising service software is used to measure the number of page views  which the advertising message has received in each month 
we and our advertising customers both have access to this 
table of contents software to verify the number of page views 
we only invoice and recognize revenues once an advertising campaign has been achieved in full  which occurs when the contractually agreed upon number of page views has been reached 
accounts receivable allowances 
accounts receivable allowances are comprised of an allowance for doubtful accounts and allowances for customer credits  including volume rebates to certain of our larger customers 
volume rebate allowances are accrued based upon estimated volume rebates to be earned in connection with client contracts 
the allowances for doubtful accounts are arrived at using a two step methodology which takes into consideration specifically identified bad debts and an overall reserve for the entire receivable asset 
the allowance for bad debts as reflected at december  and represented our best estimate of identified bad debts 
we continue to refine our estimates for bad debts over time and have adjusted the required allowance for doubtful accounts as a result of our experience 
while credit loss rates have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  fluctuations in our future credit rate losses may negatively impact our financial results 
during the year ended december   we increased our allowance for doubtful accounts to specifically address the risk associated with international expansion 
panelist incentives 
our panelists receive incentives for participating in our surveys  which are earned by the panelist when we receive a timely survey response 
a panelist has the right to claim his or her incentive payment at any time prior to its expiration  which is now generally six months of continuous inactivity 
in february  in our north american internet survey solutions segment  we reduced the expiration threshold for panelists incentives from one year to six months of inactivity 
in our north american segment we accrue incentives as incurred  and reverse expirations to the statement of operations as the expirations occur 
in our european segment accrued incentives are recorded net of estimated expirations 
in april  we began offering a program emphasizing prize based incentives  whereby the respondent is entered into a drawing with a chance to win a larger cash prize in north america 
panel acquisition 
costs associated with establishing and maintaining panels of potential survey respondents are expensed as incurred 
these costs include amortization of capitalized panel acquisitions costs associated with acquired businesses with panels of survey respondents  as well as payments to third parties who source panelists from their databases and websites 
stock based compensation 
on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r using the modified prospective method  which requires the measurement of compensation cost for all share based payment awards at fair value on the date of grant and the recognition of compensation expense over the service period for awards expected to vest 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
in march  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab relating to sfas r  the provisions of which we have applied in our adoption of sfas r 
pre tax share based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the year ended december  was million  which was related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  the stock purchase plan 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the grant date using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated financial statements 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for share based payment awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value method we recognized in our consolidated financial statements  share based compensation expense related to stock 
table of contents options granted to our employees and directors to the extent the exercise price of such stock options granted prior to our initial public offering was less than the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
share based compensation expense recognized during the current period is based on the value of the portion of share based payment awards that is ultimately expected to vest 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant in order to estimate the amount of share based awards that will ultimately vest 
the forfeiture rate is based on historical rates 
share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  includes i compensation expense for share based payment awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the pro forma provisions of sfas  and ii compensation expense for the share based payment awards granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
as share based compensation expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
in our pro forma information required under sfas for the periods prior to january   we accounted for forfeitures as they occurred 
the cumulative effect of adopting the change in estimating forfeitures is not material to our financial statements for the year ended december  see note stock based compensation 
on november   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
sfas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  fsp r 
the alternative transition method provides a simplified method to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee share based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
we adopted fsp r and elected to utilize the simplified method to establish the beginning balance of our apic pool as it relates to the tax effects of employee share based compensation 
under the simplified method  we determined that we do not have an opening apic pool 
for periods prior to  we have elected to follow accounting principle board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value method provided for under sfas in and  we granted certain options to purchase our common stock at exercise prices that were subsequently determined to be less than the fair value of our common stock and  as a result  we recorded deferred stock based compensation expense  which is amortized to earnings over the service period of the employee 
in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  we provide pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas income taxes 
deferred taxes are determined under the asset and liability approach 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized on differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
further  deferred tax assets are recognized for the expected benefits of available net operating loss carryforwards  capital loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce a deferred tax asset to an amount which we expect to realize in the future 
we continually review the adequacy of the valuation allowance and recognize these benefits only as our reassessment indicates that it is more likely than not that these benefits will be realized 
the reassessment requires us to review the positive and negative evidence available regarding the recoverability of the deferred tax assets 
as of december   and as a result of this assessment  we continue to believe that our domestic deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
during  as a result of our assessment  we released a portion of our valuation allowance that had been previously recorded against certain foreign deferred tax assets 
these foreign deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating losses acquired as a result of our ciao acquisition and  based on our assessment  are more likely than not to be realized based on expected future profitability 
as of december   an additional valuation allowance was recorded against certain other foreign deferred tax assets 
we do not believe that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
in addition  we continuously evaluate our tax contingencies and recognize a liability when we believe that it is probable that a liability exists and can be reasonably estimated 

table of contents net income loss per share 
we report net income loss per share in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
earnings per share sfas 
under sfas  basic earnings per share  which excludes dilution  is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share reflects the potential dilution of securities that could be exercised or converted into common shares  and is computed by dividing net income or loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average of common shares outstanding plus the dilutive potential common shares 
for the year ended december   diluted earnings per share includes in the money stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method and also includes the assumed conversion of preferred stock using the if converted method if dilutive 
for periods prior to our initial public offering ipo on july   due to the participation features of our series a convertible participating preferred stock  series b preferred stock convertible participating preferred stock  and series c convertible participating preferred stock  basic and diluted earnings per share have been calculated using the two class method  which is an earnings allocation formula that determines earnings per share for each class of common stock and participating security according to dividends declared or accumulated and participation rights in undistributed earnings 
in loss periods  no amounts are allocated to the participating securities 
during a loss period  the assumed exercise of in the money stock options and warrants and the conversion of convertible preferred stock has an anti dilutive effect and therefore  these instruments are excluded from the computation of dilutive earnings per share 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess purchase price over the fair values of the net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we do not amortize goodwill  but instead it is tested for impairment when changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment may exist  and at least on an annual basis 
in performing the annual impairment test  we compare the fair value of our reporting unit with its carrying value  including goodwill 
in the event that a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  we would record an adjustment to the respective reporting unit s goodwill for the difference between the implied fair value of goodwill and the carrying value 
our primary measure of fair value is based on discounted cash flows 
the measurement of fair value and resulting impairment requires management to make estimates of these cash flows related to goodwill and long lived assets as well as other fair value determinations 
we conducted our initial review as of october  and determined that an impairment of goodwill existed 
we therefore  recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million for the year ended december   which is included in impairment and restructuring charges in operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
we determined the fair value of our reporting units by discounting the cash flow projections at a discount rate  reflecting a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital 
the results of our analysis indicated that goodwill was impaired in our european business segment 
the primary reason for the impairment was the weaker than anticipated revenue and cash flow growth of our european business segment as a result of increased competition from new entrants  pricing pressure and flat revenue and bid volume during the last three quarters of we conducted our annual review as of october  and determined that no impairment of goodwill existed for the year ended december  long lived assets 
we review other long lived assets  including property and equipment and internal use software for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such an asset may not be recoverable 
management determines whether there has been any impairment on such assets by comparing anticipated undiscounted cash flows from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group to the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of any resulting impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying value to the fair value  which is estimated  primarily using the present value of the estimated future cash flows 
in estimating our future cash flows during the fourth quarter of  we used a discount rate  reflecting a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital 
we determined that business conditions in the fourth quarter of warranted a review of the fair value of our intangible assets 
our revised estimates of future european revenue and cash flow growth rates  and the continued depression of our stock price constituted a triggering event requiring an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
therefore  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million for the year ended 
table of contents december   which is included in impairment and restructuring charges in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations in connection with acquired customer relationships  non competition agreements and panel members within our european operating segment 
restructuring 
we have executed  and may continue to execute  restructuring activities that may require management to use significant estimates related to expenses for severance and other employee separation costs  lease cancellation and other costs 
if the actual amount differs from our estimates  the amount of the restructuring charges could be materially impacted 
see note for a description of restructuring charges 
translation of foreign currencies 
as a result of the ciao acquisition in april  we began significant operations in europe where the functional currency is other than the us dollar  primarily the euro 
except where indicated  effects of currency exchange rate differences between those currencies and the us dollar were immaterial during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in the prior year 
however  we cannot guarantee that such amounts will continue to be immaterial in the future 
results of operations year ended december  versus year ended december  consolidated results the following table sets forth our consolidated results of operations based on the amounts and percentage relationship of the items listed to net revenues for the periods presented in thousands net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative panel acquisition depreciation and amortization research and development impairment and restructuring charges total operating expenses operating income loss other income expense interest income expense  net other expense  net total other expense  net income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss net revenues 
net revenues for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
fluctuations in currency rates increased net revenues by approximately million 
excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations  net revenues would have increased by approximately million 
net revenues increased primarily as a result of the inclusion of three newly acquired businesses for a full twelve months in the year ended december  rapidata  gozing and ciao 
in  we owned rapidata and gozing starting on 
table of contents january  and february   respectively  and  we acquired ciao on april  net revenues also increased as a result of our comparison shopping business  which accounted for approximately million and to a lesser extent to our ciao internet survey solutions segment 
these increases were slightly offset by a reduction of approximately million in revenues associated with the gozing olm business in the prior year period  which we wound down later in the above revenue increases were partially offset by a decline in the north american internet survey solutions segment s revenues as a result of increased competition 
gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
gross profit for the year ended december  was of net revenues  compared to for the year ended december  fluctuations in currency rates increased gross profit by approximately million 
excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations  gross profit would have increased by approximately million 
gross profit increased primarily due to the additional revenues described above 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues also increased as a result of our high margin comparison shopping segment  which accounted for approximately of the increase 
the remaining increase in gross profit was due to decreased incentive costs and outside sample costs  partially offset by higher direct project labor costs 
we expect gross profit to remain variable from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix among full service  sample only  business to business  healthcare and projects requiring outside sample  which product mix remains largely unpredictable 
additionally  gross profit will be affected by the timing and amount of comparison shopping revenue recognized in each period 
we believe our overall margins could experience downward pressure as a result of the increasingly competitive environment and the resulting pricing pressure 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the prior year  an increase of million  or 
fluctuations in currency rates increased selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million 
excluding the effects of currency rate fluctuations  selling  general and administrative expenses would have increased by approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily as a result of the inclusion of costs associated with rapidata  gozing and ciao for the full twelve months in the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses in our combined european businesses increased by approximately million  which was partially offset by a decrease in selling general and administrative expenses in our legacy internet survey solutions business segment in north america of approximately million 
selling expenses  primarily personnel costs and related commissions  increased by approximately million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of costs associated with rapidata  gozing and ciao for the full twelve months in the year ended december  and the adoption of sfas r  which increased selling  general and administrative expenses by million 
marketing and promotion costs increased approximately million for the year ended december   primarily related to advertising and marketing programs related to our comparison shopping business 
these increased costs were partially offset by lower spending levels in the current year compared to the prior year associated with direct mail  print and web advertising and a redesign of our website  logo and collateral marketing materials as well as the development of advertising and marketing programs to promote our new corporate and international capabilities following the acquisitions of rapidata  gozing and ciao 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  primarily as a result of higher personnel and facility costs  primarily due to the inclusion of costs associated with rapidata  gozing and ciao for the full twelve months in the year ended december  facility costs increased approximately million due primarily to our international expansion 
personnel costs associated with general and administrative expenses increased approximately million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the following i an increase in incentive accruals for g a employees and senior management  related to our improved performance in over  
table of contents ii increased stock based compensation expense of approximately million as a result of the adoption of sfas r  iii a one time charge of million associated with the departure of two founders of ciao during  iv further investment in in finance and administrative staff  primarily in our european businesses as a result of the initial implementation of sarbanes oxley section compliance  and v the inclusion of personnel costs associated with our acquisitions of rapidata  gozing and ciao for the full twelve months in the year ended december  these increases were in turn partially offset by a decline in personnel costs as a result of a one time severance and related transition charge of million recorded in the prior year that was associated with the change in the north american senior management 
general and administrative expenses  excluding personnel costs  decreased approximately million for the year ended december  as a result of a decrease in public company expenses of approximately million and reduced bad debt expense of approximately million 
the decrease in public company expenses was primarily associated with professional services performed in the areas of accounting  audit  tax  legal  valuation services  largely due to the prior year being the first year of sarbanes oxley section compliance in north america 
this decrease was partially offset by increased costs associated with the first year of sarbanes oxley section compliance in europe in the current year 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from of the net revenues for the year ended december  in the near term  we expect selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues to remain at approximately the same level as we experienced in the year ended december  panel acquisition 
panel acquisition expenses were million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
panel acquisition expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in acquiring new panelists in the current year as the prior year included significant additional panelists acquired as a result of business acquisitions 
additionally  the current year includes higher amortization expense associated with the panel assets acquired from opinionsurveys  rapidata  gozing and ciao of million 
panel acquisition expenses were of net revenues for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  excluding the effects of amortization costs of acquired panel members  we expect our panel acquisition costs to increase as a percentage of revenues as we continue to expand the breadth and depth of our internet panels in europe  latin america  asia  eastern europe and north america 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses excluding amortization included in cost of revenues and panel acquisition expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase in depreciation and amortization expense occurred as a result of the impact of the acquisition of opinionsurveys  rapidata  gozing and ciao  as well as  significant increases in capital expenditures during and  including higher capital expenditures related to internal use software  which has a shorter estimated useful life than other capital expenditures 
research and development 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
research and development expenses increased as a result of increased north american research and development staff in the latter part of and in and to additional staff in our european businesses due primarily to increased comparison shopping growth 
we enhanced our north american research and development team to integrate the multiple technology platforms of greenfield online  inc  rapidata  gozing and ciao as well as develop new software applications to automate manual processes in our internet survey solutions operating environment 
in addition  we increased spending on research and development in our comparison shopping segment in order to improve scalability of our infrastructure and enhance the content 
table of contents and user experience on our comparison shopping websites 
we expect research and development expenses to increase in the future as we continue on the path of automating  evolving and improving our internal technologies 
impairment and restructuring charges 
we conducted a review as of october  of the fair value of our goodwill by discounting our cash flow projections at a discount rate  reflecting a risk adjusted weighted average cost of capital 
the results of our analysis indicated that goodwill was impaired in our european internet survey solutions segment 
the primary reason for the impairment was the weaker than anticipated revenue and cash flow growth of our european internet survey solutions segment as a result of increased competition from new entrants  pricing pressure and flat revenue and bid volume during the last three quarters of therefore  we recorded a non cash  pre tax impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to the goodwill of our european segment 
additionally  we wrote off to impairment approximately million of intangible assets originally established as part of the valuation of the ciao acquisition 
this impairment had the effect of reducing amortization expense in by approximately million  and further reduced amortization expense in by approximately million 
in december  we announced a rightsizing plan which involved a restructuring and rightsizing of our north american business 
we included in the year ended december   pre tax restructuring expenses of approximately million associated with office closings and personnel employment termination 
we have completed the restructuring activities under this plan and these restructuring expenses associated with our rightsizing plan did not have a material impact on our results of operations  cash flows  liquidity  or capital resources 
interest income expense  net 
net interest income for the year ended december  was million  compared to net interest expense of million for the year ended december   an increase in net interest income of million 
the increase in net interest income was primarily due to the reduction of interest expense associated with our debt and capital lease obligations  which were paid off in december and march  respectively 
additionally  we have continued to increase our excess cash position and have therefore increased our investments in marketable securities  which resulted in additional interest income 
this reduction in interest expense was partially offset by the reduction in interest income related to the excess funds being utilized to reduce this debt and to acquire rapidata  gozing and ciao  which decreased the amount of excess cash available for investments prior to the acquisitions and the pay off of our debt and capital lease obligations 
other expense  net 
other expense for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  other expense for the years ended december  and related primarily to the effects of currency rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the recording currency of the environment where our subsidiaries operate 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision for the year ended december  of million  compared to an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  the increase in the tax provision is primarily a result of the one time tax benefit recorded in the prior year period from the release of our domestic tax valuation allowance 
our effective tax rate was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the increase in our effective tax rate is primarily a result of the one time tax benefit recorded in the prior year period from the release of our domestic tax valuation allowance 
we establish valuation allowances in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
we continually assess our need for a tax valuation allowance on a quarterly basis based on all available information 
as of december   and as a result of this assessment  we continue to believe that our domestic deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
during the year ended december   as a result of this assessment  we released approximately million of our valuation allowance that had been previously recorded against certain foreign deferred tax assets 
these foreign deferred tax assets primarily relate to net operating losses acquired as a result of our ciao acquisition and  based on our assessment  are more likely than not to be realized based on expected future profitability 
of the total valuation allowance released during the year ended december  
table of contents  approximately million was released as a reduction to goodwill generated from the ciao acquisition and million was released as a component of income tax expense 
in addition  this valuation allowance release was partially offset by million for the effects of foreign currency 
as of december   an additional tax valuation allowance of approximately million was recorded against certain other foreign deferred tax assets 
we do not believe that these deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized 
in december  we completed a follow on public offering of an additional million shares of common stock 
pursuant to internal revenue code section  certain substantial ownership changes may result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards that may be utilized to offset future income tax liabilities 
we determined that this follow on public offering triggered an ownership change pursuant to internal revenue code section as a result  there will be an annual limitation on the amount of our domestic net operating loss carryforwards nols that we can utilize to offset future taxable income 
for the years ended december  and  the utilization of our domestic nols was not impacted by this limitation 
net income loss 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  the increase in net income was primarily the result of the impairment charges taken in of million  offset partially by the income tax benefit resulting from the release of our domestic deferred tax asset valuation allowance in of million

we also had investments in marketable securities of approximately million as of december  these investments remain highly liquid and are immediately available without penalty  however  they are not included in our cash equivalents as their original dates of maturity are longer than days 
including these investments  we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million at december  this increase from million at december  is primarily due to our profitability and resulting cash flow  offset by capital expenditures as well as cash utilized to repay our the million capital lease obligations with somerset capital group ltd  a leasing company somerset capital  during march years ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by provided by financing activities operating activities cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in cash flow from operations was primarily attributable to increases in accounts receivable due primarily to revenue growth and reductions of

financing activities cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  cash usage in the current year period is primarily the result of the pay off of our remaining capital leases with somerset capital in march the cash provided by financing activities in the period was primarily the result of the net proceeds from the sale of common stock to executives of rapidata and gozing in connection with those acquisitions 
our working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december   an increase of million 
the increase in working capital was primarily due to our increased revenues and profitability for the year ended december  and our resulting increased cash balances  partially offset by the use of cash to reduce long term capital lease debt 
pursuant to internal revenue code section  certain substantial ownership changes may result in an annual limitation on the amount of net operating loss or tax credit carryforwards that may be utilized to offset future income tax liabilities 
we determined that our follow on public offering in december  triggered an ownership change pursuant to internal revenue code section as a result  there will be an annual limitation on the amount of our domestic nols that we can utilize to offset future taxable income 
for the year ended december   the utilization of our domestic nols was not impacted by this limitation 
in march  we repaid all of the outstanding capital lease obligations that we had with somerset capital of approximately million  as we were generating cash flow from operations sufficient to support the needs of our on going operations and capital expenditures 
currently  we maintain an on going relationship with somerset capital to finance the acquisition of equipment  software and office furniture pursuant to leases in the event we determine that financing our capital expenditures would be beneficial to us 
if  in the future  somerset capital declines to finance our capital expenditure requirements  we believe that alternative sources of such funding would be available to us to satisfy such needs 
at december  and  we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as such  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in such relationships 
during the year ended december   we incurred capital expenditures of million and million related to north america and europe  respectively  including approximately million financed through capital leases in north america in the first quarter of  prior to our march  repayment of all of our capital lease obligations with somerset capital 
the capital expenditures are primarily for developing internal use software for our internet survey solutions and comparison shopping businesses as well as for adding computer and networking capacity in north america and europe 
in the united states and europe  capital expenditures were applied primarily to the development of internal use software and to upgrade computer servers and networking equipment to manage increased internet based survey production and data collection 
these capital expenditures were funded by a combination of capital leases from somerset capital

in the future  we expect that these costs will be funded from our cash flow from operations 
for fiscal  we expect capital expenditures to total approximately to million 
contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments and contingencies there were no material changes outside the ordinary course of business in our contractual obligations during the year ended december   except for the pay off of our capital lease obligations in march the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods total at years ended december  december  and thereafter in thousands contractual obligations capital lease obligations non cancelable operating lease obligations management change commitments other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations these management change commitments are a result of our management change in as described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
based on our current level of operations and anticipated growth  we believe that our cash generated from operations will be adequate to finance our working capital and other capital expenditure requirements through the foreseeable future  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
we believe we are more likely than not to realize our domestic and certain of our foreign deferred tax assets in the future  which could result in a reduction of our tax obligations in the future  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
poor financial results  unanticipated expenses  acquisitions of technologies  businesses or assets or strategic investments could give rise to additional financing requirements sooner than we expect 
there can be no assurance that equity or debt financing will be available to us when we need it or  if available  that the terms will be satisfactory to us and not dilutive to our then current stockholders 
impact of inflation our results are affected by the impact of inflation primarily on production  operating costs and interest rates 
the effects of inflation in changing prices on our net revenues and operations have not been material in the last three fiscal years 
however  there has been deflationary pressure on selling prices  which requires us to monitor our operating costs and efficiencies 
due to the competitive nature of the marketing research industry  there can be no assurance that this negative pressure will not continue 
historically  we have used selling price adjustments  cost containment programs and improved operating efficiencies to offset the otherwise negative impact of inflation on our operations

qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we operate primarily in the united states and europe 
however  our business is expanding both in the united states and internationally and as a result we are exposed to certain market risks that arise in the normal course of business  including fluctuations in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
these risks are not expected to be material 
however  no assurance can be given that such risks will not become material 
while we have not used derivative financial instruments in the past  we may  on occasion  use them in the future in order to manage or reduce these risks 
we do not expect to enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate and debt sensitivity as of december  and  we had borrowings under capital leases of less than million and million  respectively  most of which bore interest at fixed rates 
as such  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would not have a material impact on our earnings or cash flows 
however  should we enter into other debt arrangements which bear interest at floating rates  actual increases or decreases in earnings and cash flows in the future could differ materially from our historical experience based on the timing and amount of both interest rate changes and amounts borrowed by us 
as of december  and  we had a balance of cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million and million  respectively 
if and to the extent that these funds were invested in interest bearing instruments during the entire period  a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in the rate of interest payable on these invested funds would not have had a material impact on our earnings or cash flows for the year ended december  or currency exchange rate sensitivity during the year ended december  and  approximately and  respectively of our revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states 
prior to our acquisition of ciao in april and for the year ended december   the effects of currency rate fluctuations were not material 
since this acquisition  our results of operations were and continue to be affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  which could have a material impact on our financial results 
our policy is to hedge the impact of currency rate fluctuations only for large transactions  which could have a material impact on our financial results 
due to the relatively small transaction size and the short duration of our operating cycle  we do not typically utilize hedges 
however  we will continue to monitor such exposures and utilize hedges such as foreign currency exchange forward contracts should we believe that a particular transaction could have a material impact on our financial results 
we performed a sensitivity analysis for the year ended december  and holding all other variables constant  and assuming a hypothetical adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates  the analysis indicated that such a market movement would affect our pre tax income by approximately million and  for the year ended december  and  respectively and by an immaterial amount for the year ended december  however  actual gains and losses in the future could differ materially from this analysis based on the timing and amount of both foreign currency exchange rate movements and our actual revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies
