item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation liquidity and capital resources as of march   we had approximately million in available cash reserves which includes approximately million received from the march exercise of warrants described below 
as we have a million note payable to dr 
rudolf gunnerman due by december   described below  we face uncertainty regarding our ability to operate as a going concern beyond that date 
additional funding will be necessary 
until that note is due  we anticipate that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our cash requirements from cash presently on hand  based upon our current levels of expenditures and anticipated needs during this period 
we have historically been able to raise capital to continue with our research and development and it is likely that we will need to raise additional funds before we can generate enough revenue to become profitable 
on march   we completed a private placement to a small number of accredited investors for the sale of  units  each unit consisting of one share of the company s common stock and one warrant to purchase a share of common stock 
each unit was sold at a price of per share  resulting in gross proceeds at closing of million 
the warrants were exercisable  in whole or in part  at a fixed price equal to per share for a period of months following their issuance 
on march   as an incentive for the march private placement warrant holders to exercise half of their warrants for  shares of our common stock  we agreed to reduce the exercise price of all such warrants to the current trading value based on the march  closing price of per share of our common stock 
we also agreed to issue additional warrants with rights to acquire the same number of shares as were acquired by the exercise of those warrants in march  also at per share  to expire in three years 
additional warrants on the same terms are also to be issued to investors who exercise any of their remaining warrants in the exercises of these warrants in march generated  in  we conducted two private placements with institutional and other third party investors for the sale of units consisting of our common stock  warrants  and rights to acquire additional stock and warrants  generating net cash proceeds of approximately million 
additional amounts of approximately million in and approximately million in were generated from the exercises of rights and warrants related to the june private placements as an incentive for the warrant holders of the private placement to exercise their remaining warrants in march  we issued additional warrants with rights to acquire the same number of shares as were acquired by the exercise of warrants in march these additional warrants have an exercise price of per share and expire in three years 
most of the warrant holders exercised their remaining warrants whereby we generated approximately million 
as of december   we were obligated to pay approximately  in the aggregate to investors in the private placements as late registration fees and interest due to the fact that the registration statement covering the private placement shares was not declared effective by the sec by the time required by the investor agreements 
we plan to work with our investors to issue common stock in lieu of these obligations  however  as of the date of this report no formal agreements have been entered into with any investors regarding such issuances 
in december  dr 
gunnerman advanced million to us as a loan 
the loan is evidenced by a promissory note which bears interest at the rate of above the day libor rate  adjusted quarterly and payable annually 
in  million of principal was repaid on this loan  and the entire principal amount is due and payable december  because of the significant amount of legal proceedings we have experienced  especially in the last year  we still owed approximately million for attorney fees and related legal costs at the end of on march   we successfully negotiated a reduction in these billings by approximately  the extent and timing of our future capital requirements will depend primarily upon the rate of our progress in the development and commercialization of our technologies  including the successful implementation of our venture with fujairah oil technology and other third parties  and the timing of future customer orders 
to date  we have generated no material revenues from our business operations 
we are unable to predict when or if we will be able to generate future revenues from commercial activities or the amounts expected from such activities 
these revenue streams may be generated by us or in conjunction with collaborative partners or third party licensing arrangements  and may include provisions for one time  lump sum payments in addition to ongoing royalty payments or other revenue sharing arrangements 
we presently have no binding commitments for any such revenues 
future revenues and profits from fujairah oil technology are dependent upon the successful implementation of our sonocracking technology 
other possible sources of additional capital include the exercise of the remaining warrants issued to investors in the march private placement and of the additional warrants issued in march  and funding through future collaborative arrangements  licensing arrangements and debt and equity financings 
we do not know whether additional financing will be available on commercially acceptable terms when needed 
if we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms when needed  we may not be able to successfully commercialize our technologies  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to unanticipated requirements 
if we are unable to secure such additional financing when needed  we will have to curtail or suspend all or a portion of our business activities 
further  if we issue equity securities  our shareholders may experience severe dilution of their ownership percentage 
results of operations as a development stage company  we have not generated any material revenues since we commenced our current line of business in in  we received  from sulphco korasia formerly known as oil sc  ltd  pursuant to our equipment sale and marketing agreement 
as this amount is fully refundable if the pilot plant does not ultimately meet the agreed specifications  no portion of the purchase price has been or will be recorded as revenue in our financial statements until the pilot plant meets all agreed specifications 
we do not have an equity interest in sulphco korasia 
there was no activity in with regard to the pilot plant 
research and development expenses during  we incurred approximately million related to research and development of our sonocracking technology 
this compares to approximately million and  during and  respectively 
in  approximately million was spent on building construction and construction  purchase  and installation of equipment in fujairah  uae 
also in  approximately million in construction of a testing unit to be utilized in austria was expensed 
during  approximately  represents amounts paid to our engineers and other research and development employees as wages and related benefits and for design and testing of our sonocracker units  and approximately million was incurred for the procurement of control panels  probes  centrifuges  and generators related to the ongoing research and development of our units 
the remainder of our research and development costs are recurring monthly expenses related to the maintenance of our warehouse facilities 
we expect our research and development expenses to decrease significantly upon successful transition into generation of sustained revenue 
thereafter  research and development will continue as needed to enhance our technology 
selling  general and administrative expenses during  we incurred approximately million in selling  general and administrative expenses 
this compares to approximately million and million during and  respectively 
legal fees were approximately million during  reflecting substantial increases over and amounts which were approximately million and  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to litigation fees relating to the lawsuits against us 
we expect to incur similar legal fees in  due to the on going litigation described above in item legal proceedings 
consulting fees  payroll and related expenses were approximately million in which compares to approximately million and during and  respectively 
salaries include grants of  shares to new officers   in the first quarter of and  in the first quarter of excluding the stock grants and options  our consulting fees  payroll and related expenses increased from the prior year in and in these increases reflect the quality of our work force 
travel and travel related expenses were approximately million in which compares to approximately  and  during and  respectively 
the percentage increase from the prior year was in and in these increases were due to meetings of the board of directors  meetings with the european manufacturers of our equipment  and meetings with our joint venture partner in fujairah  uae 
director fees were approximately million in which compares to approximately million and  during and  respectively 
director fees in these periods represent grants to each new director of  shares each and a grant of options to robert van maasdijk  a director  in the second quarter of specifically  the following grants were issued to the following directors in an option valued at  to acquire  shares of common stock was granted to director robert van maasdijk 
 shares of common stock valued at  were granted to directors ed urquhart  mike heffner  and larry schafran 
in  shares of common stock valued at  were granted to directors hannes farnleitner  robert van maasdijk  raad alkadiri  christoph henkel 
in  shares of common stock valued at  were granted to director  richard masica 
the remainder of the amounts incurred relate to normal recurring operating expenses such as lease expense  utilities  marketing  and investor relations 
interest expense interest expense was approximately  in  which compares to approximately  and  during and  respectively 
these increases result from a combination of incurring late registration fees beginning near the end of which accrue interest see late registration below and net interest rate increases in our variable rate debt to dr 
rudolf gunnerman 
during the second quarter of  we paid off a  note to dr 
gunnerman bearing interest of and paid  against the  note to dr 
gunnerman which has a variable interest rate during the third quarter of 
late registration in accordance with the terms of our private placement  we accrued late fees of approximately  during the first two quarters of  due to a delay in the effective date of our registration statement filed with the sec 
our registration statement was declared effective by the sec in june interest of approximately   per quarter accrues on the unpaid amount at the rate of per annum 
however  as of the date of this report no formal demands have been made by investors to pay these fees 
depreciation and amortization during the years   and  exclusive of the fujairah test facility  we expended approximately million  million and  respectively  for equipment and to maintain exclusivity for the sale and or licensing of our sonocracking technology in the united states and abroad 
our depreciation expense related to current and previously capitalized equipment for   and were approximately   and  respectively 
our amortization expense related to patent and trademark rights  for   and were approximately  and respectively 
we expect to continue our pursuit of exclusive distribution and licensing of our technology and purchasing equipment for the manufacture and upgrading of our sonocracking technology 
loss on impairment of asset in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we determined in that a previously capitalized prototype no longer reflected the value of our commercially viable technology  resulting in an impairment loss of approximately  there was no comparable item in the other years 
net loss we incurred net losses of approximately million in  million in  and million in the substantial increase in net loss in primarily reflects the construction of the fujairah test facility  which has been expensed as research and development in  as indicated above under the heading research and development 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million  which includes approximately million of stock based compensation expense  and we incurred a net loss of approximately million for the month period ending december  these losses are principally associated with the research and development of our sonocracking technology  including the construction of the test facility in fujairah  as more thoroughly explained below  the construction of the pilot plant in south korea  development of prototypes  and related marketing activity 
although we expect to continue to incur expenses in the future for development  commercialization and sales and marketing activities related to the commercialization of our technologies  such expenditures will not include major construction projects until commercialization can be proven to be profitable 
operation and maintenance of the fujairah test facility is the responsibility of fujairah oil technology llc fot and sulphco is responsible for contributing its sonocracking units 
our present timetable calls for production to begin by the end of until fot generates revenues  additional expenses for completion of the sonocracking test facility are estimated initially at  per month and will be paid by the company 
the memorandum of association of fujairah oil technology  which defines certain rights of the joint venture partners  calls for profits and losses to be shared  with profits being distributed to the partners  subject to a reserve for legal expenses which may be waived by the partners 
sulphco s share of distributions made by the joint venture to sulphco will also be subject to other costs and expenses incurred directly by sulphco from time to time  including commissions payable directly by sulphco to third parties  presently estimated at up to of sulphco s net joint venture profits 
we expect that following the successful commissioning of the first sonocracking unit and probe test  funding of direct expenditures required to start up the  bbl day facility  such as tank storage and pipelines  will be available from financing through the joint venture 
the present timetable represents management s best estimate based upon progress to date and presently known circumstances  and all parties are fully committed to a timely rollout of the fujairah facility 
due to the inherent complexities involved in the installation of a facility of this magnitude  however  there may be unforeseen delays in our current timetable  which will in turn affect the timing and availability of revenues 
in addition  future costs and expenses are estimates  and therefore we cannot assure you that our cost estimates will not increase 
in addition to activities related to the fujairah joint venture  we intend to continue to incur additional expenditures during the next months for development and testing of sonocracker units 
off balance sheet arrangements we issued warrants as part of the private placements of our securities in june and march as of december   the warrants outstanding from those placements were as follows exercise option total exercise price share shares amount from june placement from june placement from march placement the exercise price for the march warrants was reduced to per share under an amended agreement of march  see the narrative that follows 
on march   as described above under liquidity and capital resources  we lowered the exercise price to per share for the warrants issued in the march placement and issued additional warrants as an incentive for warrant holders to exercise their warrants 
this caused the issuance of approximately an additional million shares of our common stock and a like number of additional warrants in exchange for approximately million 
up to million additional shares of common stock may be issued in under this agreement for per share  which would also require the issuance of additional warrants with rights to purchase million shares 
after march   if all remaining warrant holders under this agreement were to exercise all their warrants  we would issue approximately an additional million shares in exchange for approximately million 
contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years related party loan operating lease obligations purchase obligations total item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we consider our exposure to market risks to be immaterial 
although there is market risk involving changes in the interest rates which apply to our note payable and our cash investments  such risk is minor 
our risk related to foreign currency fluctuations is not material at this time  as any accounts payable we have in foreign denominations are not in themselves material 
our note payable is for  and is due december  its rate is keyed to a libor rate and adjusted quarterly 
were this rate to increase dramatically  its impact would terminate at the end of the year when the note is due 
the current rate is and will be adjusted again based on libor rates at march  june  and september of this year 
even in the event that the rate increased per quarter  the impact would be a  additional outlay for interest 
as we anticipate needing to use the cash we held at year end within a short period  we have it invested for the most part in money market accounts 
the amount of fluctuation in interest rates will not expose us to any significant risk due to market fluctuation as the interest on our note payable would likely decrease by a greater amount
