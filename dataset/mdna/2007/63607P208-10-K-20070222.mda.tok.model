executive overview the company is a leading independent distributor of financial services products primarily to high net worth individuals and growing entrepreneurial companies 
founded in  and commencing operations on january   the company has grown internally and through acquisitions and  as of december   operates a national distribution network with over owned firms 
the company acquired  and firms in   and  respectively 
the company s operating results have improved from net income of million in to net income of million in as a result of new acquisitions and the growth of previously acquired firms  total revenue has grown from million in to nearly billion of revenue in  a compound annual growth rate of over 
the company s firms earn revenue that consists primarily of commissions and fees earned from the sale of financial products and services to their clients and incur commissions and fees expense and operating expense in the course of earning revenue 
the company pays management fees to non employee principals of its firms based on the financial performance of each respective firm 
the company refers to revenue earned by the company s firms minus the expenses of its firms  including management fees  as gross margin 
the company excludes amortization and depreciation from gross margin 
these amounts are included in amounts disclosed separately as part of corporate and other expenses 
management uses gross margin as a measure of the performance of the firms that the company has acquired 
through acquisitions and internal growth  gross margin has grown from million in to million in the company s gross margin is offset by expenses that it incurs at the corporate level  including corporate and other expenses 
corporate and other expenses have grown from million in to million in corporate and other expenses include general and administrative expenses  which are the operating expenses of nfp s corporate headquarters and a portion of stock based compensation 
general and administrative expenses have grown from million in to million in general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue declined from in to in many external factors affect the company s revenue and profitability  including economic and market conditions  legislative and regulatory developments and competition 
because many of these factors are unpredictable and generally beyond the company s control  the company s revenue and earnings may fluctuate from year to year and quarter to quarter 
in  the company s revenue and net income  particularly in the fourth quarter of  benefited from strong sales of financed life insurance products 
management believes that sales of financed life insurance products diminished in which was a significant component in the decline in sales growth from prior periods 
acquisitions under nfp s typical acquisition structure  the company acquires of the equity of independent financial services products distribution businesses on terms that are relatively standard across its acquisitions 
to determine the company s acquisition price  nfp management first estimates the annual operating cash flow of the business to be acquired based on current levels of revenue and expense 
for this purpose  the company defines operating cash flow as cash revenue of the business less cash and non cash expenses  other than amortization  depreciation and compensation to the business s owners or individuals who subsequently become principals 
the company refers to this estimated annual operating cash flow as target earnings 
the 
table of contents company s acquisition price is a multiple generally in a range of five to six times of a portion of the target earnings  which the company refers to as base earnings 
base earnings averaged of target earnings for all firms owned at december  in determining base earnings  management focuses on the recurring revenue of the business 
recurring revenue refers to revenue from sales previously made such as renewal commissions on insurance products  commissions and administrative fees for ongoing benefit plans and mutual fund trail commissions and fees for assets under management 
the company enters into a management agreement with principals and or certain entities they own 
under the management agreement  the principals and or such entities are entitled to management fees consisting of all future earnings of the acquired business in excess of the base earnings up to target earnings  and a percentage of any earnings in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 
the company retains a cumulative preferred position in the base earnings 
to the extent earnings of a firm in any year are less than base earnings  in the following year nfp is entitled to receive base earnings together with the prior years shortfall before any management fees are paid 
additional purchase consideration is often paid to the former owners based on satisfying specified internal growth thresholds over the three year period following the acquisition 
substantially all of the company s acquisitions have been paid for with a combination of cash and nfp s common stock  valued at its then fair market value 
the company requires its principals to take typically at least of the total acquisition price in nfp common stock  however  through december   principals have taken on average approximately of the total acquisition price in nfp s common stock 
the following table shows acquisition activity including sub acquisitions in the following periods for the years ended december  in thousands  except number of acquisitions closed number of acquisitions closed consideration cash common stock other a a consists principally of the assumption of debt and capitalized acquisition costs 
although management believes that the company will continue to have opportunities to complete a similar number of acquisitions as nfp has in the past  there can be no assurance that nfp will be successful in identifying and completing acquisitions see risk factors risks relating to the company the company may be unsuccessful in acquiring suitable acquisition candidates  which could adversely affect its growth 
any change in the company s financial condition or in the environment of the markets in which nfp operates could impact its ability to source and complete acquisitions 
revenue the company generates revenue primarily from the following sources life insurance commissions and estate planning fees 
insurance and annuity commissions paid by insurance companies are based on a percentage of the premium that the insurance company charges to 
table of contents the policyholder 
first year commissions are calculated as a percentage of the first twelve months premium on the policy and earned in the year that the policy is originated 
in many cases  the company s firms receive renewal commissions for a period following the first year 
some of the company s firms receive fees for the settlement of life insurance policies 
these fees are generally based on a percentage of the settlement proceeds 
the company s firms also earn fees for developing estate plans 
revenue from life insurance activities also include amounts received by the company s life brokerage entities  including its life settlements brokerage entity  that assist non affiliated producers with the placement and sale of life insurance 
corporate and executive benefits commissions and fees 
the company s firms earn commissions on the sale of insurance policies written for benefit programs 
the commissions are paid each year as long as the client continues to use the product and maintain its broker of record relationship with the firm 
the company s firms also earn fees for the development and implementation of corporate and executive benefit programs as well as fees for the duration that these programs are administered 
asset based fees are also earned for administrative services or consulting related to certain benefits plans 
financial planning and investment advisory fees and securities commissions 
the company s firms earn commissions related to the sale of securities and certain investment related insurance products as well as fees for offering financial advice and related services 
these fees are based on a percentage of assets under management and are generally paid quarterly 
in a few cases  incentive fees are earned based on the performance of the assets under management 
some of the company s firms charge flat fees for the development of a financial plan or a flat fee annually for advising clients on asset allocation 
some of the company s firms also earn additional compensation in the form of incentive and marketing support revenue from manufacturers of financial services products  based on the volume  persistency and profitability of business generated by the company from these three sources 
these forms of payments are earned both with respect to sales by the company s owned firms and sales by nfp s affiliated third party distributors 
nfpsi  the company s registered broker dealer and investment adviser  also earns commissions and fees on the transactions effected through it 
most principals of the company s firms  as well as many of its affiliated third party distributors  conduct securities or investment advisory business through nfpsi 
incidental to the corporate and executive benefits services provided to their customers  some of the company s firms offer property and casualty insurance brokerage and advisory services 
the company believes these services complement the corporate and executive benefits services provided to the company s clients 
nfp earns commissions and fees in connection with these services 
although the company s operating history is limited  the company believes that its firms earn approximately to of their revenue in the first three quarters of the year and approximately to of their revenue in the fourth quarter

commissions and fees are typically paid to third party producers  who are producers that are affiliated with nfp s firms 
commissions and fees are also paid to non affiliated producers who utilize the services of one or more of the company s life brokerage entities including the company s life settlements brokerage entity 
commissions and fees are also paid to non affiliated producers who provide referrals and specific product expertise to nfp firms 
when business is generated solely by a principal  no commission expense is incurred because principals are only paid from a share of the cash flow of the acquired firm through management fees 
however  when income is generated by a third party producer  the producer is generally paid a portion of the commission income  which is reflected as commission expense of the acquired firm 
in addition  nfpsi pays commissions to members of the marketing organizations that transact business through nfpsi 
operating expenses 
the company s firms incur operating expenses related to maintaining individual offices  including compensating producing and non producing staff 
firm operating expenses also include the expenses of nfpsi and nfpisi  two subsidiaries that serve the company s acquired firms and through which the company s acquired firms and its third party distributors who are members of its marketing organizations access insurance and financial services products and manufacturers 
with the adoption of sfas r the company now records share based payments related to firm employees and firm activities to operating expenses as a component of cost of services 
previously all share based expense components for year end periods prior to december  were recorded under corporate and other expenses general and administrative expense 
management fees 
the company pays management fees to the principals of its firms and or certain entities they own based on the financial performance of the firms they manage 
the company typically pays a portion of the management fees monthly in advance 
once the company receives cumulative preferred earnings base earnings from a firm  the principals and or an entity the principals own will earn management fees equal to earnings above base earnings up to target earnings 
an additional management fee is paid in respect of earnings in excess of target earnings based on the ratio of base earnings to target earnings 
for example  if base earnings equal of target earnings  the company receives of earnings in excess of target earnings and the principal and or the entity receives 
a majority of the company s acquisitions have been completed with a ratio of base earnings to target earnings of 
management fees also include an accrual for certain performance based incentive amounts payable under the company s ongoing incentive plan 
incentive amounts are paid in a combination of cash and the company s common stock 
for firms that began their incentive period prior to january   the principal could elect from to to be paid in the company s common stock 

table of contents in addition to the incentive award  the company pays an additional cash incentive equal to of the incentive award elected to be received in the company s stock 
this election is made subsequent to the completion of the incentive period 
no accrual is made for these additional cash incentives until the related election is made 
however  for firms beginning their incentive period on or after january  with the exception of highland firms  the principal is required to take a minimum of maximum of the incentive award in common stock 
the company accrues on a current basis for these firms the additional cash incentive of the stock portion of the award based upon the principal s election of the minimum percentage required to be received in company stock 
the ratio of management fees to gross margin before management fees is dependent on the percentage of total earnings of the company s firms capitalized by the company  the performance of the company s firms relative to base earnings and target earnings  the growth of earnings of the company s firms in the periods after their first three years following acquisition and the earnings of nfpisi  nfpsi and earnings of a small number of firms without a principal  from which no management fees are paid 
due to the company s cumulative preferred position  if a firm produces earnings below target earnings in a given year  the company s share of the firm s total earnings would be higher for that year 
if a firm produces earnings at or above target earnings  the company s share of the firm s total earnings would be equal to the percentage of the earnings capitalized by the company in the initial transaction  less any percentage due to additional management fees earned under ongoing incentive plans 
with the adoption of sfas r  effective january   the company now records share based payments related to principals in management fees which are included as a component of cost of services 
previously  all shared based expense components for year end periods prior to december  were recorded under corporate and other expenses general and administrative expense

depreciation expense related to the company s firms as well as the company s corporate office is recorded within this line item 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets 
the firms the company acquires may not continue to positively perform after the acquisition for various reasons  including legislative or regulatory changes that affect the products in which a firm specializes  the loss of key clients after the acquisition closed  general economic factors that impact a firm in a direct way  the cultural incompatibility of an acquired firms management team with the company and the death or disability of significant principals 
in such situations  the company may take impairment charges in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
and reduce the carrying cost of acquired identifiable intangible assets including book of business  management contracts  institutional customer relationships and tradename and goodwill to their respective fair values 
management reviews and evaluates the financial and operating results of the company s acquired firms on a firm by firm basis throughout the year to assess the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets associated with these firms 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  management uses historical trends and makes projections regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the recoverably of the respective assets 
if a firm s goodwill and other intangible assets do not meet the recoverability test  the firm s carrying value will be compared to its estimated fair value 
the fair value is based upon the amount at which the acquired firm could be bought or sold in a current transaction between the company and the principals and or the present value of the assets future cash flows 
the intangible assets associated with a particular firm may be impaired when the firm has experienced a significant deterioration in its business indicated by an inability to produce at the level of base earnings for a period of four consecutive quarters and when the firm does not appear likely to improve its operating results or cash flows in the foreseeable future 
management believes that this is an appropriate time period to evaluate firm performance given the seasonal nature of many firms activities 
loss gain on sale of businesses 
from time to time  the company has disposed of acquired firms or certain assets of acquired firms 
in these dispositions  the company may realize a gain or loss on the sale of acquired firms or certain assets of acquired firms 
results of operations through acquisitions and internal growth  the company has achieved revenue growth of   and in the years ended december   and  respectively 
this growth was driven by the company s acquisitions and internal growth in the revenue of its acquired firms  augmented by the growth of nfpisi and nfpsi 
in  and  the company s firms had an internal revenue growth rate of  and  respectively 
as a measure of financial performance  the company calculates the internal growth rate of the revenue of the company s firms 
this calculation compares the change in revenue of a comparable group of firms for the same time period in successive years 
the company includes firms in this calculation at the beginning of the first fiscal quarter that begins one year after acquisition by the company unless a firm has merged with another owned firm or has made a sub acquisition that represents more than of the base earnings of the acquiring firm 
with respect to two owned firms that merge  the combined firm is excluded from the calculation from the time of the merger until the first fiscal quarter that begins one year after acquisition by the company of the most recently acquired firm participating in the merger 
however  if both firms involved in a merger are included in the internal growth rate calculation at the time of the merger  the combined firm continues to be included in the calculation after the merger 
with respect to the sub acquisitions described above  to the extent the sub acquired firm does not separately report financial statements to nfp  the acquiring firm is excluded from the calculation from the time of the sub acquisition until the first fiscal quarter beginning one year following the sub acquisition 
sub acquisitions that represent less than of the base earnings of the acquiring firms are considered to be 
table of contents internal growth 
for further information about sub acquisitions  see business operations sub acquisitions 
with respect to dispositions  the company includes these firms up to the time of disposition and excludes these firms for all periods after the disposition 
the calculation is adjusted for intercompany transactions for all periods after december  management believes that the intercompany adjustments made to the internal revenue growth rate for periods after december  does not significantly impact its comparability with prior year periods 
the company s management also monitors acquired firm revenue  commissions and fees expense and operating expense from new acquisitions as compared with existing firms 
for this purpose  a firm is considered to be a new acquisition for the twelve months following the acquisition 
after the first twelve months  a firm is considered to be an existing firm 
within any reported period  a firm may be considered to be a new acquisition for part of the period and an existing firm for the remainder of the period 
additionally  nfpsi and nfpisi are considered to be existing firms 
a sub acquisition involves the acquisition by one of nfp s firms of a business that is too small to qualify for a direct acquisition by nfp or where the individual running the business wishes to exit immediately or soon after the acquisition  prefers to partner with an existing principal or does not wish to be a principal 
the acquisition multiple paid for sub acquisitions is typically lower than the multiple paid for a direct acquisition by nfp 
sub acquisitions that do not separately report their results are considered to be part of the firm making the acquisition  and the results of firms disposed of are included in the calculations
