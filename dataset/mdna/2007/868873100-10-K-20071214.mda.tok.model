item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition  results of operations and trends for the future should be read together with selected financial data and our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
any discussion and analysis regarding trends in our future financial condition and results of operations are forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions  as more fully identified in forward looking statements and risk factors 
our actual future financial condition and results of operations may differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements 
overview surmodics is a leading provider of surface modification and drug delivery technologies to the healthcare industry 
the company is organized into three operating segments composed of seven technology centered and industry focused business units 
the drug delivery operating segment contains the drug delivery business unit  which is responsible for technologies dedicated to site specific delivery of drugs  the ophthalmology business unit  which is dedicated to the advancement of treatments for eye diseases  such as age related macular degeneration amd and diabetic macular edema dme  two of the leading causes of blindness  and the brookwood pharmaceuticals unit  which provides proprietary polymer based technologies to companies developing improved pharmaceutical products 
the hydrophilic and other operating segment consists of three business units the hydrophilic technologies business unit  which focuses on enhancing medical devices with advanced lubricious coatings that facilitate their placement and maneuverability in the body  the regenerative technologies business unit  which is developing platforms intended to augment or replace tissue organ function eg  cell encapsulation applications  or to modify medical devices to facilitate tissue organ recovery through natural repair mechanisms eg  hemo biocompatible or prohealing coatings  and the orthopedics business unit  which is committed to innovative solutions for orthopedics patients using proven surmodics technologies  and creating new technology solutions to existing patient care gaps in the orthopedics field 
the in vitro operating segment contains the in vitro technologies formerly diagnostics and drug discovery business unit  which includes our genomics slide technologies  our stabilization products  antigens and substrates for immunoassay diagnostic tests  our in vitro diagnostic format technology and our synthetic ecm cell culture products 
revenue in each of our operating segments is derived from three primary sources royalties and license fees from licensing our patented surface modification and drug delivery technologies and in vitro diagnostic formats to customers  the vast majority typically in excess of of revenue in the royalties and license fees category is in the form of royalties  the sale of reagent chemicals to licensees of our technologies  stabilization products  antigens and substrates to the diagnostics industry and coated glass slides to the genomics market  and research and development fees generated on customer projects 
revenue should be expected to fluctuate from quarter to quarter depending on  among other factors our customers success in selling products incorporating our technologies  the timing of introductions of coated products by customers  the timing of introductions of products that compete with our customers products  the number and activity level associated with customer development projects  the number and terms of new license agreements that are finalized  the value of reagent chemicals and other products sold to licensees  and the timing of future acquisitions we complete  if any 
for financial accounting and reporting purposes  we treat our three operating segments as one reportable segment 
we made this determination because a significant percentage of our employees provide support services including research and development to each operating segment  technology and products from each operating segment are marketed to the same or similar customers  each operating segment uses the same sales and marketing resources  and each operating segment operates in the same regulatory environment 
in january  we acquired all of the assets of innorx  inc by paying cash and issuing shares of surmodics common stock to innorx stockholders 
innorx was an early stage company developing drug delivery implants and therapies for the ophthalmology market 
the assets we acquired were folded into our newly created ophthalmology business unit 
prior to the acquisition  surmodics held an ownership interest in innorx of less than and accounted for the investment under the cost method 
upon completion of the innorx acquisition  we retroactively adjusted our previously reported results to show the impact of accounting for innorx under the equity method 
the net impact was an approximate  reduction in net income for fiscal from previously reported results 
in june  we signed a collaborative research and license agreement with merck to pursue the joint development and commercialization of the i vation sustained drug delivery system with triamcinolone acetonide and other products that combine merck proprietary drug compounds with the i vation system for the treatment of serious retinal diseases 
under the terms of our agreement with merck  we received an up front license fee of million and may receive up to an additional million in fees and development milestones associated with the successful product development and attainment of appropriate us and eu regulatory approvals for these new combination products 
we will also be paid for our activities in researching and developing these combination products 
additionally  under the terms of our agreement with merck  we will be responsible for the exclusive manufacture and supply of clinical and commercial products 
once products licensed under the agreement are commercialized  we will also receive royalties on sales of such products 
in july  we acquired all of the assets of brookwood pharmaceuticals  inc by paying cash to southern research institute  which owned the capital stock of brookwood 
brookwood is a drug delivery company based in birmingham  alabama that provides its proprietary polymer based technologies to companies developing improved pharmaceutical products 
brookwood is a wholly owned subsidiary of surmodics and is reported as part of our drug delivery operating segment 
in august  we acquired all of the assets of biofx laboratories  inc by paying cash to biofx stockholders 
based in owings mills  maryland  biofx laboratories is a leading manufacturer of substrates  a critical component of diagnostic test kits used to detect and signal that a certain reaction has taken place 
biofx is a wholly owned subsidiary of surmodics and is reported as part of our in vitro operating segment 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are based in part on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following are critical areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  shipment has occurred or delivery has occurred if the terms specify destination  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
however  when there are additional performance requirements  revenue is recognized when such requirements have been satisfied 
royalty revenue is generated when a licensed customer sells products incorporating our technologies 
royalty revenue is recognized as our licensees report it to us  and payment is typically submitted concurrently with a quarterly report 
revenue related to a performance milestone is recognized upon achievement of the milestone and meeting specific revenue recognition criteria 
we recognize initial license fees over the term of the related agreement 
product sales to third parties are recognized at the time of shipment  provided that an order has been received  the price is fixed or determinable  collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and returns can be reasonably estimated 
our sales terms provide no right of return outside of our standard warranty policy 
payment terms are generally set at days 
generally  revenue for research and development is recorded as performance progresses under the applicable contract 
when we have revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we comply with emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and recognize each element as it is earned 
costs related to products delivered are recognized in the period revenue is recognized 
customer advances are accounted for as a liability until all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
valuation of long lived assets 
we periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that may affect the estimated useful life or the recoverability of the remaining balance of long lived assets  such as property and equipment 
if such events or circumstances were to indicate that the carrying amount of these assets would not be recoverable  we would estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges or other measure of fair value were less than the carrying amount of the assets  we would recognize an impairment charge 
in september  we signed an agreement to sell our bloomington facility and based on the selling price recorded a million impairment charge 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the acquired entities over the fair value assigned to the assets purchased and liabilities assumed in connection with the company s acquisitions 
the carrying amount of goodwill is evaluated annually  and between annual evaluations if events occur or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
investments 
investments consist principally of us government and government agency obligations and mortgage backed securities 
our investment policy calls for no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations 
investments are classified as available for sale  that is  investments are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from operations and reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  except for other than temporary impairments  which are reported as a charge to current operations and result in a new cost basis for the investment 
results of operations years ended september  and fiscal fiscal increase dollars in thousands decrease change revenue drug delivery    hydrophilic and other    in vitro    total revenue    revenue 
fiscal revenue was million  an increase of million or from fiscal a decrease in drug delivery operating segment revenue was more than offset by growth in the hydrophilic and other and in vitro operating segments  as detailed in the table above and further explained in the narrative below 
drug delivery 
revenue in the drug delivery segment decreased to million in fiscal the decrease in total revenue reflects a significant decrease in royalties and license fees  which was partially offset by an increase in research and development revenue related to drug delivery and ophthalmology projects and the addition of million in revenue from brookwood pharmaceuticals 
drug delivery derives a substantial majority of its revenue from royalties and license fees and product sales attributable to cordis corporation  a johnson johnson company  on its cypher sirolimus eluting coronary stent 
the cypher stent incorporates a proprietary surmodics polymer coating that delivers a therapeutic drug designed to reduce the occurrence of restenosis in coronary artery lesions 
the decrease in drug delivery royalties and license fees principally reflects decreased royalty revenue from cordis as a result of lower cypher sales 
partially offsetting the decrease attributable to cypher was an increase in royalties and license fees from ophthalmology customers  as well as an increase in research and development fees from drug delivery and ophthalmology customers 
we received a million license fee from merck in association with the collaborative research and license agreement that we signed in fiscal however we recognized as revenue only a small portion of this fee as we will be amortizing these payments over the estimated economic life of the technology we licensed to merck 
fiscal sales of reagent chemicals chemicals that we manufacture and sell to licensees for coating their medical devices to cordis decreased slightly when compared with the prior year 
the unit volume of reagents sold to cordis will likely be directly impacted by the proportion of stenting procedures that utilize drug eluting stents  in addition to relative market share positions of drug eluting stent players 
the cypher stent  from which we derive a substantial majority of our drug delivery revenue  faces continuing competition from boston scientific corporation s taxus drug eluting stent  which is sold within and outside the us  and stents from medtronic  abbott vascular and others sold outside the us in addition  drug eluting stents from medtronic and abbott are expected to be approved in the us within the next year 
these stents compete or will compete directly with the cypher stent 
in addition to competition among the various players  the total size of the drug eluting stent market has decreased significantly in the past eighteen months as a result of concerns about product safety  mostly related to potential clotting associated with stents 
therefore  future royalty and reagent sales revenue could decrease because of lower cypher stent sales as a result of the market contraction and the ongoing and expected future competition 
we anticipate that quarterly royalty revenue from the cypher stent may be volatile throughout fiscal and beyond as the various marketers of drug eluting stents continue competing in the marketplace and as others enter the marketplace 
management expects royalties from the cypher stent to continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenue in fiscal however  whether and the extent to which royalties from the cypher stent continue to constitute a significant source of revenue is subject to a number of risks  including intellectual property litigation generally  and specifically the damages  settlements and mutual agreements that may result from various infringement suits between boston scientific and cordis in which each has been found to have violated certain intellectual property rights of the other 
the inclusion of brookwood pharmaceuticals  which contributed to drug delivery revenue for only two months in fiscal  will also impact the overall revenue and mix in fiscal a substantial majority of brookwood s revenue is comprised of research and development fees 
hydrophilic and other 
hydrophilic and other revenue increased to million  primarily as a result of growth in royalties and license fees and growth in reagent sales  partially offset by a decrease in research and development revenue 
in contrast to our drug delivery segment  where a significant percentage of revenue is attributable to cordis  there are several dozen licensees and an even larger number of coated products generating royalties in our hydrophilic and other segment 
the growth in royalties principally reflects increased sales of coated products already on the market  and to a lesser extent newly introduced licensed products 
we believe that revenue will likely continue to increase in fiscal  however  the rate of growth will depend upon the timing and market success of newly released products 
in vitro 
revenue in the in vitro segment increased to million 
over of the increase was attributable to increased royalties and license fees 
the balance of the growth resulted from growth in sales of our stabilization products  antigens and substrates used by diagnostic kit manufacturers in immunoassay diagnostic tests 
we began selling recombinant autoimmune antigens in the first quarter of fiscal  and sales of biofx products following the acquisition of biofx in august contributed million of product sales to our results 
we anticipate continued growth in our in vitro segment revenue in fiscal  but the rate of growth will likely not be as high as fiscal we anticipate continued growth in product sales reflecting particularly the addition of biofx products for a full year of operations  but the rate of growth will depend on the success of certain product launches 
royalties and license fees likely will not increase 
in vitro derives a significant percentage of its revenue from ge healthcare and abbott laboratories 
product costs 
product costs were million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
overall product margins averaged  compared with reported last year 
the decrease in product margins reflects the mix of products sold in the period in particular  some of our stabilization and antigen products  genomics slides and brookwood polymer products carry lower margins than our reagent products and higher depreciation costs on the recently constructed manufacturing space at our eden prairie facility 
we anticipate that product margins will continue to be lower on a year over year basis throughout fiscal when compared to prior year results  principally as a result of product mix 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects the addition of brookwood pharmaceuticals and biofx laboratories to our operations  higher compensation expenses as we have added personnel to support customer projects and internal development projects  increased incentive and stock based compensation  and higher costs related to our internal development projects 
research and development expenses are expected to continue to increase in fiscal reflecting the addition of brookwood pharmaceuticals and biofx laboratories to our operations  and as we expand our research and development organization 
brookwood s research and development expenses  in particular  are a higher percentage of that unit s total revenues than for our other business units 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal the increase principally reflects the addition of brookwood pharmaceuticals and biofx laboratories to our operations  higher compensation expenses  and increased incentive and stock based compensation 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase reflecting the addition of brookwood pharmaceuticals and biofx laboratories to our operations  and as we expand our organization to support our anticipated growth 
purchased in process research and development 
in july  we acquired all of the assets of brookwood pharmaceuticals  inc by paying cash to southern research institute  which owned the capital stock of brookwood 
results in the fourth quarter of fiscal include an in process research and development charge of million related to the brookwood acquisition 
the fair value of the in process research and development was determined by an independent valuation consultant 
other income  net 
other income was million in fiscal  compared with a loss of million in fiscal the fiscal loss primarily reflects a million impairment loss on our investment in novocell  which we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal income from investments was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the increase reflects higher yields generated from our investment portfolio 
income tax expense 
the income tax provision was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal the effective tax rate in fiscal was 
excluding the impact of the non tax deductible purchased in process research and development charges  the fiscal effective rate was 
excluding the impact of the million impairment loss in fiscal since the company does not currently foresee offsetting capital gains to offset this capital loss  no tax benefit has been recorded  the effective tax rate was in fiscal years ended september  and fiscal fiscal dollars in thousands increase increase revenue drug delivery    hydrophilic and other    in vitro   total revenue    revenue 
fiscal revenue was million  an increase of million or from fiscal we experienced growth in all three operating segments as detailed in the table above and further explained in the narrative below 
drug delivery 
revenue in the drug delivery segment increased to million in fiscal the growth in total revenue reflects increases in royalties and license fees  and research and development revenue related to drug delivery and ophthalmology projects 
drug delivery derives a substantial majority of its revenue from royalties and license fees and product sales attributable to cordis corporation  a johnson johnson company  on its cypher sirolimus eluting coronary stent 
the cypher stent incorporates a proprietary surmodics polymer coating that delivers a therapeutic drug designed to reduce the occurrence of restenosis in coronary artery lesions 
over three fourths of the overall increase in drug delivery revenue reflects increased royalty revenue from cordis as a result of higher cypher sales 
the balance of the fiscal increase was a result of increased research and development fees from drug delivery and ophthalmology customers 
fiscal sales of reagent chemicals chemicals that we manufacture and sell to licensees for coating their medical devices to cordis decreased slightly when compared with the prior year 
hydrophilic and other 
hydrophilic and other revenue increased to million  primarily as a result of growth in royalties and license fees and growth in reagent sales  partially offset by a decline in research and development revenue 
in contrast to our drug delivery segment  where a significant percentage of revenue is attributable to cordis  there are several dozen licensees and an even larger number of coated products generating royalties in our hydrophilic and other segment 
the growth in royalties principally reflects increased sales of coated products already on the market  and to a lesser extent newly introduced licensed products 
in vitro 
revenue in the in vitro segment increased to million 
roughly of the increase was attributable to growth in sales of our stabilization products used by diagnostic kit manufacturers in immunoassay diagnostic tests 
the balance of the growth resulted from increased royalty revenue from our diagnostic format patents 
in vitro derives a significant percentage of its revenue from ge healthcare and abbott laboratories 
product costs 
product costs were million in fiscal  a increase from the prior year 
overall product margins averaged  on par with the reported for the comparable period in research and development expenses 
research and development expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal approximately million of the million increase was related to non cash stock based compensation charges following the adoption of sfas no 
r 
research and development expenses included no such charge in fiscal excluding stock based compensation  research and development expenses increased in fiscal the balance of the increase reflects higher costs associated with the clinical trial on our i vation intravitreal implant  increased costs of operating the recently constructed clean rooms and drug coating suites at our eden prairie headquarters  and increased personnel costs 
these increased costs were partially offset by reduced legal costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  an increase of compared with fiscal we recorded approximately million in non cash stock based compensation charges compared with  in fiscal excluding the impact of stock based compensation  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased approximately as a result of the cost savings realized since we exited our contract manufacturing facility in bloomington in april the majority of the operating costs of the bloomington facility were reported in selling  general and administrative expenses 
asset impairment charge 
results in fiscal included a non cash asset impairment charge of million against our bloomington  minnesota  contract manufacturing facility 
results in fiscal included a non cash asset impairment charge of million against the facility 
in september  we entered into an agreement to sell the bloomington facility and consolidated operations at our eden prairie  minnesota  headquarters in april purchased in process research and development 
in january  the company acquired all of the assets of innorx  inc by paying cash and issuing shares of surmodics common stock to innorx stockholders 
results in the second quarter of fiscal include a non cash in process research and development charge of million 
the fair value of the in process research and development was determined by an independent valuation consultant 
other income  net 
other income resulted in a loss of  in fiscal compared with income of million in fiscal  primarily as a result of the million impairment loss on our investment in novocell we recorded in the second quarter of fiscal income from investments was million in fiscal  an increase of million  compared with million in fiscal the increase reflects higher levels of investable cash and higher yields generated from our investment portfolio 
prior year other income results also include a  loss related to the impact of accounting for the innorx acquisition under the equity method 
we recorded no such comparable transaction in fiscal income tax expense 
the income tax provision was million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal excluding the impact of the million impairment loss since the company does not currently foresee offsetting capital gains to offset this capital loss  no tax benefit has been recorded  the effective tax rate was in fiscal  compared with for fiscal when the impact of non tax deductible purchased in process research and development is excluded 
the impact of adopting sfas no 
r accounts for the bulk of the increase in the effective tax rate from fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of september   the company had working capital of million and cash  cash equivalents and investments totaling million 
the company s investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
the company s policy requires that no more than of investments be held in any one credit issue  excluding us government and government agency obligations 
the primary investment objective of the portfolio is to provide for the safety of principal and appropriate liquidity while meeting or exceeding a benchmark merrill lynch year government corporate index total rate of return 
management plans to continue to direct its investment advisors to manage the company s investments primarily for the safety of principal for the foreseeable future as it assesses other investment opportunities and uses of its investments 
the company had positive cash flows from operating activities of approximately million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal the following table depicts our cash flows from operations for each of fiscal and for the years ended september  dollars in thousands net income   depreciation and amortization   stock based compensation   purchased in process research development  asset impairment charge  net other operating activities   net change in deferred revenue   net change in other operating assets and liabilities  net cash provided by operating activities   while net income in fiscal decreased compared with fiscal  certain non cash charges contributed substantially to the decrease in net income 
specifically  we recorded a million in process research and development charge in connection with the acquisition of brookwood pharmaceuticals and million of stock based compensation 
additionally  we received a million up front license fee from merck in fiscal  of which million remains in deferred revenue 
we conduct a significant majority of our operations at our eden prairie  minnesota headquarters 
throughout fiscal and  we constructed capital improvements to enhance the research and development capabilities at the eden prairie facility 
the million in capital improvements were sufficiently complete by the end of second quarter of fiscal  allowing us to vacate our contract manufacturing facility in bloomington  minnesota  and consolidate our minnesota operations at our eden prairie headquarters 
in addition to our eden prairie location  we lease approximately  square feet of commercial office space in irvine  california  where our ophthalmology business unit conducts a portion of its operations 
in september  we leased  square feet of office and warehouse space in eden prairie  minnesota to accommodate planned growth and to construct manufacturing capabilities in support of our ophthalmology business 
in september  we made a commitment to purchase for million certain additional sublicense rights and the accompanying future royalty revenue streams under certain sublicenses through an amendment to our diagnostic format patent license with abbott laboratories 
prior to such amendment  we were receiving only a portion of the royalties under such sublicenses 
the first million installment was paid in november we made an additional million installment payment in june the remaining million installment is reflected in other current liabilities at september  in january  we entered into a merger agreement whereby surmodics acquired all of the assets of innorx  inc by paying approximately million in cash and issuing  shares of surmodics common stock to innorx stockholders 
in july  we issued  shares of surmodics common stock to the shareholders of innorx upon the successful completion of the first milestone involving the innorx technology acquired in the purchase of innorx 
in march  we issued an additional  shares as a result of completion of the second milestone 
upon the successful completion of the remaining development and commercial milestones involving innorx technology acquired in the transaction  we will be required to issue up to approximately  additional shares of our common stock to the stockholders of innorx 
in january  we made an equity investment of approximately million in octoplus  a company based in the netherlands active in the development of pharmaceutical formulations incorporating novel biodegradable polymers 
in may  we made an additional investment of approximately  as of september  the million investment  which is accounted for under the cost method  represented an ownership interest of less than 
in october  we made an additional investment of million  bringing our total investment to million  representing an ownership interest of less than 
also in october  octoplus common stock began trading on an international exchange following an initial public offering of its common stock 
with a readily determinable fair market value  the company now treats the investment in octoplus as an available for sale investment rather than a cost method investment 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common stock 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares of its common stock for million at an average price of per share 
in july  we made equity investments in paragon intellectual properties  llc paragon and apollo therapeutics  llc apollo  a paragon subsidiary 
the paragon and apollo investments totaled million 
the arrangement calls for surmodics to invest additional equity totaling million upon successful completion of specified development milestones  which we expect to occur no later than the second quarter of fiscal our investment in paragon represents an ownership interest of approximately and the investment in apollo represents an ownership interest of less than 
following the additional investment  our investment in apollo will represent an ownership interest of 
we account for our investments in paragon and apollo under the equity method 
in july  we entered into a stock purchase agreement with southern research institute whereby we acquired of the capital stock of brookwood pharmaceuticals  inc brookwood for million in cash on the closing date  and up to an additional million in cash upon the successful achievement of specified milestones 
brookwood is a drug delivery company based in birmingham  alabama that provides proprietary polymer based technologies to companies developing pharmaceutical products 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in august  we entered into a stock purchase agreement to acquire of the capital stock of biofx laboratories  inc biofx for million in cash on the closing date  and up to an additional million in cash upon the successful achievement of specified milestones

see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in august  we entered into an agreement to purchase an undeveloped parcel of land in eden prairie  minnesota for approximately million including a non refundable deposit of  paid to the seller at the time we signed the agreement 
the agreement requires that we complete the purchase on or before august  while it is the company s intention to complete the purchase on or before that date  if we fail to do so  we will be required to pay the seller million and will have no further rights to acquire the land 
we have a current income tax liability of million  which will be paid in december this payment will include taxes payable on the million up front license fee received from merck 
because this license fee will be amortized over years under the eitf accounting treatment  the related tax expense has been deferred and will be recognized over the same period 
accordingly  going forward  we will carry a deferred tax asset even though the cash taxes will have been paid 
in october  qlt inc acquired forsight newco ii forsight  a company with drug delivery technology for ophthalmology 
surmodics held a small equity stake in forsight  for which we received an initial payment of over  in cash  which will be recorded as other income in fiscal additionally  we may receive future payments associated with the successful attainment of certain clinical development  and commercialization milestones for products developed by qlt that incorporate the technology acquired from forsight 
the amount of any such payments will be prorated according to the level of our equity ownership in forsight prior to the acquisition 
in november  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s stock 
no purchases have been made to date under this authorization 
as of september   we had  of long term debt in connection with our brookwood pharmaceuticals and biofx subsidiaries 
we do not have any other credit agreements 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments will be adequate to fund our operations and material commitments into the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements as of september   the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements with any unconsolidated entities

the agreement requires that we complete the purchase on or before august  while it is the company s intention to complete the purchase on or before that date  if we fail to do so  we will be required to pay the seller million and will have no further rights to acquire the land 
new accounting pronouncements on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 was issued 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin also prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the new fasb interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective for the company beginning in fiscal the company is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no

this statement establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures on fair value measurements 
sfas no

sfas no 
is effective for the company in fiscal the company is currently evaluating the impact  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on the consolidated financial position and results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s investment policy requires investments with high credit quality issuers and limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company s investments principally consist of us government and government agency obligations and investment grade  interest bearing corporate debt securities with varying maturity dates  the majority of which are five years or less 
because of the credit criteria of the company s investment policies  the primary market risk associated with these investments is interest rate risk 
surmodics does not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk or to speculate on future changes in interest rates 
a one percentage point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of the company s available for sale securities as of september   but no material impact on the results of operations or cash flows 
management believes that a reasonable change in raw material prices would not have a material impact on future earnings or cash flows because the company s inventory exposure is not material 
although we conduct business in foreign countries  our international operations consist primarily of sales of reagent and stabilization chemicals 
additionally  all sales transactions are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  we do not expect to be subject to material foreign currency risk with respect to future costs or cash flows from our foreign sales 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
