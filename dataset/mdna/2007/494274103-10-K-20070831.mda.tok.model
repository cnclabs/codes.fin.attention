r  share based payment the company maintains stock based employee compensation plans 
prior to fiscal year  the company accounted for the plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations apb 
accordingly  because all stock options granted had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of the grant  no expense related to employee stock options was recognized in income 
however  expense related to other share based awards such as restricted share units rsus and performance shares had been recognized in the income statement under apb effective july   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no

that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
as of june   there was approximately million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted share units rsu awarded under the plan 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
fas r requires that forfeitures be estimated over the vesting period of an award  rather than being recognized as a reduction of compensation expense when the forfeiture actually occurs 
fas r also requires that liability awards be revalued to fair value  which  upon the adoption of fas r in fiscal year  had the effect of a reduction of a liability for outstanding stock appreciation rights 
the impact of the revaluation of the stock appreciation rights and the use of the estimated forfeiture method for periods prior to fiscal year totaled million of income  net of taxes  and is presented on the consolidated statements of income for fiscal year as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  as required by fas r

consolidated gross profit as a percent of sales in fiscal year was compared to in fiscal year with the fiscal year and acquisitions  the company s sales mix continues to shift toward the electronic contract assemblies segment 
since the electronic contract assemblies segment operates at a lower gross profit percentage than the furniture segment  this is contributing to the consolidated gross profit downward trend 
the fiscal year electronic contract assemblies segment gross profit percentage declined compared to fiscal year while the fiscal year furniture segment gross profit percentage improved compared to fiscal year consolidated selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased in absolute dollars but decreased as a percent of net sales compared to fiscal year the decline in consolidated sg a costs as a percent of net sales was due to the leverage of the additional net sales from the acquisitions and the shift in sales mix toward the electronic contract assemblies segment  which has a lower sg a percentage than the furniture segment 
fiscal year other income decreased compared to fiscal year primarily due to million pre tax income relating to funds received in fiscal year as part of a polish offset credit program for investments made in the company s poland operation 
the fiscal year effective income tax rate was as compared to a effective income tax rate in fiscal year the increased effective income tax rate was related to a higher mix of income being generated by domestic operations in fiscal year  which carry a higher effective tax rate  coupled with the negative effect of losses generated by select foreign operations which have a lower effective tax rate 
for fiscal year  in addition to the positive impact of a higher mix of income being generated at foreign operations  the fiscal year effective tax rate was also driven down by million for adjustments to income tax accruals resulting from the favorable closure of several prior year tax audits 
comparing the balance sheets as of june  to june   the increased balances in the company s receivables  inventories  goodwill  and property and equipment were primarily related to the acquisition of reptron 
likewise  the decline in the company s cash and short term investment balances was primarily a result of the reptron acquisition 
other long term assets increased on higher supplemental employee retirement plan investment balances and restricted cash 
an increase in accounts payable related to the reptron acquisition was partially offset by a reduction in accounts payable at the company s other operations 
furniture segment furniture segment net sales and open orders were as follows at or for the year ended june change amounts in millions net sales furniture segment branded furniture contract private label furniture total open orders furniture segment branded furniture contract private label furniture total price increases net of higher discounting increased fiscal year net sales of branded furniture  which includes office and hospitality furniture  by approximately million as compared to fiscal year increased net sales volumes of hospitality furniture also contributed to the increased branded furniture net sales level

branded furniture products open orders at june  were higher than open orders at june  as higher hospitality furniture open orders offset lower office furniture open orders 
net sales of contract private label products decreased in conjunction with the planned exit of this product line 
the furniture segment income from continuing operations was million in fiscal year  inclusive of after tax restructuring charges of million  compared to income from continuing operations of million in fiscal year  which included million of after tax restructuring charges

see the discussion below for more information on this selling price change 
increased sales to customers in the medical and industrial control industries more than offset decreased sales to customers in the automotive industry driven by declines in the domestic automotive market 
excluding acquisitions  sales to customers in the medical industry would have declined

due to the contract nature of the company s business  open orders at a point in time may not be indicative of future sales trends 
electronic contract assemblies segment fiscal year income from continuing operations totaled million  inclusive of after tax restructuring charges of million  as compared to fiscal year income from continuing operations of million  inclusive of after tax restructuring charges of million 
the restructuring charges were related to the exit of a north american manufacturing facility as discussed in more detail in

beginning in the third quarter of fiscal year  gross profit as a percent of sales was favorably impacted by a reduction in the pricing of select raw material which is purchased from bayer ag and affiliates  a major customer within the electronic contract assemblies segment 
the selling price of the finished product back to bayer ag and affiliates was likewise reduced by an amount equal to the material price reduction 
while there was no impact to gross profit dollars  net income  or net cash flows related to this pricing change  gross profit as a percent of net sales increased and sg a as a percent of net sales increased by a similar percentage 
this relationship with bayer ag and affiliates was part of an acquisition completed in the fourth quarter of fiscal year fiscal year gross profit as a percent of net sales declined from fiscal year as net sales of higher margin mature products  primarily automotive products  reached end of life and were replaced with net sales of lower margin new products including certain assemblies produced at the acquired business units  which more than offset the positive gross profit percentage impact of the above mentioned bayer ag selling price change 
while the above mentioned bayer pricing change negatively impacted sg a as a percent of net sales  the sg a as a percent of net sales for this segment declined overall in part due to lower incentive compensation costs 
the fiscal year and acquisitions also had the effect of lowering this segment s gross profit and sg a as a percent of net sales 
the acquisitions positively contributed to this segment s earnings 
the fiscal year and earnings were unfavorably impacted by after tax costs  in millions  of and  respectively  related to the start up of a manufacturing facility in china 
the company has received final customer approval to begin production at this facility

fiscal year electronic contract assemblies segment earnings also benefited from a lower effective tax rate due to adjustments to income tax accruals 
included in this segment are a significant amount of sales to bayer ag affiliates and trw automotive  inc sales to these two customers accounted for the following portions of consolidated net sales and electronic contract assemblies segment net sales year ended june bayer ag affiliated sales as a percent of consolidated net sales trw sales as a percent of consolidated net sales bayer ag affiliated sales as a percent of electronic contract assemblies segment net sales trw sales as a percent of electronic contract assemblies segment net sales the reduced trw automotive  inc percentages of segment and consolidated net sales were a result of certain trw automotive  inc products reaching end of life in addition to the higher total net sales base resulting from the acquisitions which likewise drove the higher percentages of net sales to bayer ag affiliates compared to the prior year 
in january  bayer ag sold its diagnostics unit to siemens ag  and thus a portion of the company s net sales which were formerly to bayer ag affiliates are now to siemens ag 
net sales to bayer ag affiliates were also impacted in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year as a result of the company s aforementioned selling price reduction to bayer ag affiliates which was offset by an equal reduction in the material cost 
the company also continues to focus on diversification of the electronic contract assemblies segment customer base 
the nature of the electronic manufacturing services industry is such that the start up of new customers and new programs to replace expiring programs occurs frequently 
new customer and program start ups generally cause losses early in the life of a program  which are generally recovered as the program matures and becomes established 
this segment continues to experience margin pressures related to an overall excess capacity position in the electronics subcontracting services market 
new business awards for projects in the automotive industry are extremely competitive 
risk factors within this segment include  but are not limited to  general economic and market conditions  increased globalization  foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  rapid technological changes  component availability  the contract nature of this industry  unexpected integration issues with acquisitions  and the importance of sales to large customers 
the continuing success of this segment is dependent upon its ability to replace expiring customers programs with new customers programs
