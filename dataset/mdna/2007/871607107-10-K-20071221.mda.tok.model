with respect to our designware core intellectual property products  we typically license those products to our customers under nonexclusive license agreements that provide usage rights for specific applications 
fees under these licenses are typically charged on a per design basis plus  in some cases  royalties 
finally  our global technical services team providing design consulting services typically operate under consulting agreements with our customers with statements of work specific to each project 
proprietary rights synopsys primarily relies upon a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws and license and nondisclosure agreements to establish and protect its proprietary rights 
our source code is protected both as a trade secret and as an unpublished copyrighted work 
however  third parties may develop similar technology independently 
in addition  effective copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries 
we currently hold united states and foreign patents on some of the technologies included in our products and will continue to pursue additional patents in the future 
in many cases  under our customer agreements and other license agreements  we offer to indemnify our customer if the licensed products infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights 
as a result  we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights 
for example  we are currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company 
we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it

item a 
risk factors weakness  budgetary caution or consolidation in the semiconductor and electronics industries may continue to negatively impact our business 
in recent years  we believe that eda industry growth has been adversely affected by many factors  including ongoing efforts by semiconductor companies to control their spending  uncertainty regarding the long term growth rate of the semiconductor industry  excess eda tool capacity of some of our customers and increased competition in the eda industry itself causing pricing pressure on eda vendors 
if these factors persist or additional semiconductor industry growth does not occur or if we do not benefit from any such increases  our business  operating results and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
we also believe that  over the long term  growth in eda spending will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor r d spending and continued growth in the overall semiconductor market 
however  we cannot predict the timing or magnitude of growth in semiconductor revenues  r d spending or spending on eda products  nor whether we will benefit from any of these increases should they occur 
competition in the eda industry may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
we compete with other eda vendors that offer a broad range of products and services  primarily cadence design systems  inc and mentor graphics corporation and with other eda vendors that offer products focused on one or more discrete phases of the ic design process  such as magma design automation  inc we also compete with customers internally developed design tools and capabilities 
if we fail to compete effectively  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
we compete principally on technology leadership  product quality and features including ease of use  time to results  post sale support  interoperability with our own and other vendors products  price and payment terms 
additional competitive challenges include the following price continues to be a competitive factor 
we believe that some eda vendors are increasingly offering discounts  which could be significant 
if we are unable to match a competitor s pricing for a particular solution  we may lose business  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  particularly if the customer chooses to consolidate all or a substantial portion of their other eda purchases with the competitor 
technology in the eda industry evolves rapidly 
accordingly  we must correctly anticipate and lead critical developments  innovate rapidly and efficiently  improve our existing products  and successfully develop or acquire new products 
if we fail to do so  our business will be materially and adversely affected 
to compete effectively  we believe we must offer products that provide both a high level of integration into a comprehensive platform and a high level of individual product performance 
we have invested significant resources into further development of our galaxy design platform  integration of our discovery verification platform and enhancement of its systemverilog and other advanced features and development of our design for manufacturing and ip portfolios 
we can provide no assurance that our customers will find these tool and ip configurations more attractive than our competitors offerings or that our efforts to balance the interests of integration versus individual product performance will be successful 
payment terms are also an important competitive factor and are aggressively negotiated by our customers 
payment terms on time based licenses have generally lengthened over time 
longer payment terms could continue in the future  which would negatively affect our future operating cash flow 
potential consolidation of competitors 
if any of our competitors consolidate  they may be able to exert additional market power and or offer lower pricing  either of which would make it more difficult to compete successfully 
lack of growth in new ic design starts  industry consolidation and other potentially long term trends may adversely affect the eda industry  including demand for our products and services 
the increasing complexities of socs and ics  and customers concerns about managing cost and risk have also led to the following potentially long term negative trends the number of ic design starts has remained flat during the last three years 
new ic design starts are one of the key drivers of demand for eda software 
a number of mergers in the semiconductor and electronics industries have occurred and more are likely 
mergers can reduce the aggregate level of purchases of eda software and services  and in some cases  increase customers bargaining power in negotiations with their suppliers  including synopsys 
due to factors such as increased globalization  cost controls among customers appear to have become more permanent  adversely impacting our customers eda spending 
industry changes  plus the cost and complexity of ic design  may be leading some companies in these industries to limit their design activity in general  to focus only on one discrete phase of the design process while outsourcing other aspects of the design  or using field programmable gate arrays fpgas  an alternative chip technology 
all of these trends  if sustained  could have a material adverse effect on the eda industry  including the demand for our products and services  which in turn would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in  or interpretations of  accounting principles could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects  including changes to our prior financial statements  which could cause our stock price to decline 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
these principles are subject to interpretation by the sec and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles 
a change in these principles  or in our interpretations of these principles  can have a significant effect on our reported results and may retroactively affect previously reported results 
for example  in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab addresses the process and diversity in practice of quantifying misstatements and provides interpretive guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
in the year of adoption  sab allows a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment for errors that were not previously deemed material  but are material under the guidance in sab we adopted the provisions of sab in the fourth quarter of fiscal and as a result recognized a one time adjustment of approximately million to retained earnings 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin addresses recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions 
fin will be effective for synopsys beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year upon adoption of fin  we are required to make an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the impact of adoption as well as adjust certain balance sheet amounts to conform with the new standard 
while we are in the process of completing our review of fin  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our retained earnings or our results of operations for fiscal year however  certain reclassifications to our assets and liabilities may be required 
we have received a revenue agent s report from the internal revenue service claiming a significant increase in our us taxable income 
an adverse outcome could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
on june   we received a revenue agent s report rar in which the internal revenue service irs proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years and of approximately million  plus interest 
this proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between synopsys and a wholly owned foreign subsidiary 
we strongly believe the proposed irs adjustment and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws  and that we thus have meritorious defenses to this proposed irs adjustment 
on july   we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs  which caused the matter to be referred to the appeals division of the irs 
in december  we reached a tentative settlement with the appeals division that would resolve this dispute 
the settlement is subject to further review and approval within the government  which we expect will take several more months  but we believe that settlement is likely 
if the settlement becomes final on the tentative terms agreed upon  then we have already adequately provided for this matter 
final resolution of this matter could take considerable time or may not be finally approved by the government  in which case  while we believe we are still adequately provided for regarding this matter  there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of the matter could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
unfavorable tax law changes  an unfavorable government review of our tax returns or changes in our geographical earnings mix or forecasts of foreign source income could adversely affect our effective tax rate and our operating results 
our operations are subject to income and transaction taxes in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions 
a change in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which we do business  including an increase in tax rates or an adverse change in the treatment of an item of income or expense  could result in a material increase in our tax expense 
our tax filings are subject to review or audit by the internal revenue service and state  local and foreign taxing authorities 
we exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes and  in the ordinary course of our business  there may be transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
in the third quarter of fiscal year  the irs started an examination of our federal income tax returns for the fiscal years through as of october   the examination is still in progress and no adjustments have been proposed by the irs which would require an adjustment to the tax provision 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  we can provide no assurance that any final determination in the audit will not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
if additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit  there could be a material adverse effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made 
we have large operations both in the united states and in multiple foreign jurisdictions with a wide range of statutory tax rates 
certain foreign operations are subject to temporary favorable foreign tax rates 
therefore  any changes in our geographical earning mix in various tax jurisdictions and expiration of foreign tax rulings could materially increase our effective tax rate 
furthermore  we maintain deferred tax assets related to federal foreign tax credits and our ability to use these credits is dependent upon having sufficient future foreign source income in the united states 
changes in our forecasts of such future foreign source income could result in an adjustment to the deferred tax asset and a related charge to earnings which could materially affect our financial results 
our revenue and earnings fluctuate  which could cause our financial results to not meet expectations and our stock price to decline 
many factors affect our revenue and earnings  including customer demand  license mix  the timing of revenue recognition on products and services sold and committed expense levels  making it difficult to predict revenue and earnings for any given fiscal period 
accordingly  stockholders should not view our historical results as necessarily indicative of our future performance 
from time to time  we provide guidance related to our future financial performance 
in addition  financial analysts publish their own expectations of our future financial performance 
because our quarterly revenue and our operating results fluctuate  future financial performance is difficult to predict 
downward adjustments of our guidance or the failure to meet our guidance or the expectations of research analysts would cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
some of the specific factors that could affect our revenue and earnings in a particular quarter or over several fiscal periods include  but are not limited to we base our operating expenses in part on our expectations for future revenue and generally must commit to expense levels in advance of revenue being recognized 
since only a small portion of our expenses varies with revenue  any revenue shortfall typically causes a direct reduction in net income 
our revenue and earnings targets over a number of fiscal periods assume a certain level of orders and a certain mix between upfront and time based licenses 
the amount of orders received and changes in the mix due to factors such as the level of overall license orders  customer demand  customer payment terms and ship dates could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and earnings 
for example  if we ship more upfront licenses than expected during any given fiscal period  our revenue and earnings for that period could be above our targets even if orders are below target  conversely  if we ship fewer upfront licenses than expected  our revenue and earnings for that period could fall below our targets even if orders meet or even exceed our target 
similarly  if we receive a lower than expected level of time based license orders during a given period  our revenue in future periods could be negatively affected 
we may be required to implement a number of cost control measures in order to meet our externally communicated financial targets  any of which could fail to result in the anticipated cost savings or could adversely affect our business 
the market for eda products is dynamic and depends on a number of factors including consumer demand for our customers products  customer r d and eda tool budgets  pricing  our competitors product offerings and customer design starts 
it is difficult to predict in advance the effect of these and other factors on our customers demand for our products on a medium or long term basis 
as a result  actual future customer purchases could differ materially from our forecasts which  in turn  could cause our actual revenue to be materially different than our publicly disclosed targets 
we often amend our contracts with our customers to extend the term or add new products 
although these amendments can provide a longer term payment stream from the customers  they can also result in a lower amount of revenue being recognized per year than under the original arrangement even if the total value of the extended contract is larger 
certain of our upfront and time based license agreements provide customers the right to re mix a portion of the software initially subject to the license for other specified synopsys products 
while this practice helps assure the customer s access to the complete design flow needed to manufacture its product  use of these arrangements could result in reduced revenue compared to licensing the individual tools separately 
in the past  we have regularly received a significant proportion of our orders for a given quarter in the last one or two weeks of the quarter 
the delay of one or more orders  particularly an upfront order  could have a material adverse effect on our revenue and or earnings for that quarter 
we rely on a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenue and the loss of one of such customers could have an adverse effect on our subsequent revenue and or earnings  we make significant judgments relating to revenue recognition  specifically determining the existence of proper documentation  establishing that the fee is fixed or determinable  verifying delivery of our software and assessing the creditworthiness of our customers 
while we believe our judgments in these areas are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such judgments will not be challenged in the future 
in such an event  we could be required to reduce the amount of revenue we have recognized in prior periods  which would have an adverse impact on our reported results of operations for those periods 
our customers spend a great deal of time reviewing and testing our products  either alone or against competing products  before making a purchase decision 
accordingly  our customers evaluation and purchase cycles may not match our fiscal quarters 
further  sales of our products and services may be delayed if customers delay project approvals or starts because of budgetary constraints or their budget cycles 
the failure to meet the semiconductor industry s demands for advancing eda technology and continued cost reductions may adversely affect our financial results 
soc and ic functionality continues to increase while feature widths decrease  substantially increasing the complexity  cost and risk of ic design and manufacturing 
to address greater complexity  semiconductor designers and manufacturers demand continuous innovation from eda suppliers 
at the same time  as a general business trend  we believe some customers and potential customers are seeking to buy more products from fewer suppliers and at reduced overall prices in an effort to reduce overall cost and risk 
in order to succeed in this environment  we must successfully meet our customers technology requirements  while also striving to reduce their overall costs and our own operating costs 
failure to manage these conflicting demands successfully would materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
customer payment defaults or related issues could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our backlog consists principally of customer payment obligations not yet due that are attributable to software we have already delivered 
these customer obligations are typically not cancelable  but will not yield the expected revenue and cash flow if the customer defaults or declares bankruptcy and fails to pay amounts owed 
in these cases  we will generally take legal action to recover amounts owed 
moreover  existing customers may seek to renegotiate pre existing contractual commitments due to adverse changes in their own businesses 
though we have not  to date  experienced a material level of defaults  any material payment default by our customers or significant reductions in existing contractual commitments would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
businesses we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future may not perform as we project 
we have acquired a number of companies or their assets in recent years and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future 
in addition to direct costs  acquisitions pose a number of risks  including potential negative impact on our earnings per share  failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales  problems in integrating the acquired products with our products  difficulties in retaining key employees and integrating them into our company  failure to realize expected synergies or cost savings  regulatory delays  drain on management time for acquisition related activities  assumption of unknown liabilities  and adverse effects on customer buying patterns or relationships 
while we review proposed acquisitions carefully and strive to negotiate terms that are favorable to us  we can provide no assurance that any acquisition will positively affect our future performance 
furthermore  if we later determine we cannot use or sell an acquired product or technology  we could be required to write down the goodwill and intangible assets associated with the product or technology  any such write downs could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
conditions of foreign economies  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and the increasingly global nature of our operations could adversely affect our performance 
during fiscal and  we derived and of our revenue from outside the united states  going forward  we expect our overall orders and revenue targets will continue to depend on substantial contributions from customers outside the united states 
foreign sales are vulnerable to regional or worldwide economic  political and health conditions  including the effects of international political conflict  hostilities and natural disasters 
further  any deterioration of foreign economies or foreign currency exchange rates would adversely affect our performance by reducing the amount of revenue derived from outside the united states 
our operating results are also affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
our results of operations can be adversely affected when the us dollar weakens relative to other currencies  including the euro  the japanese yen and the canadian dollar  as a result of the conversion of revenue and expenses of our foreign operations denominated in foreign currencies into the dollar 
exchange rates are subject to significant and rapid fluctuations  and therefore we cannot predict the prospective impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
while we hedge some foreign currency exposures of our business  we are unable to hedge all of our currency exposures  and there can be no assurance our hedging activities will completely mitigate our foreign currency risks 
in addition  we have expanded our non us operations significantly in the past several years 
while the increased international presence of our business creates the potential for cost reductions locally and higher international sales  this strategy also requires us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees  manage multiple  remote locations performing complex software development projects and ensure intellectual property protection outside of the united states 
the failure to effectively manage our global operations would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
from time to time we are subject to claims that our products infringe on third party intellectual property rights 
under our customer agreements and other license agreements  we agree in many cases to indemnify our customers if our products infringe on a third party s intellectual property rights 
as a result  we are from time to time subject to claims that our products infringe on these third party rights 
for example  in march  we settled a matter with magma design  inc in which both parties claimed patent infringement 
as part of the settlement  magma paid us an aggregate of million 
we are also currently defending some of our customers against claims that their use of one of our products infringes on a patent held by a japanese electronics company 
we believe this claim is without merit and will continue to vigorously defend against it 
these types of claims can  however  result in costly and time consuming litigation  require us to enter into royalty arrangements  subject us to damages or injunctions restricting our sale of products  require us to refund license fees to our customers or to forgo future payments or require us to redesign certain of our products  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
a failure to protect our proprietary technology would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends in part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
to protect this technology  we rely on agreements with customers  employees and others and on intellectual property laws worldwide 
we can provide no assurance that these agreements will not be breached  that we would have adequate remedies for any breach or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
moreover  some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property  our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited 
we have a policy of aggressively pursuing action against companies or individuals that wrongfully appropriate or use our products and technologies 
for example  we are pursuing anti piracy cases against certain companies located in china 
however  there can be no assurance that these actions will be successful 
if we do not obtain or maintain appropriate patent  copyright or trade secret protection  for any reason  or cannot fully defend our intellectual property rights in some jurisdictions  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  intellectual property litigation is lengthy  expensive and uncertain and legal fees related to such litigation may reduce our net income 
our business is subject to evolving corporate governance and public disclosure regulations that have increased both our costs and the risk of noncompliance  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
we are subject to rules and regulations promulgated by a number of governmental and self regulated organizations  including the sec  nasdaq and the public company accounting oversight board 
many of these regulations continue to evolve  making compliance more difficult and uncertain 
in addition  our efforts to comply with these new regulations have resulted in  and are likely to continue to result in  increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities 
in particular  section of sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations require us to include a management assessment of our internal control over financial reporting and auditor attestation of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual reports 
this effort has required  and will continue to require in the future  the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources 
any failure to complete a favorable assessment and obtain an unqualified opinion from our auditors could have a material adverse effect on our stock price 
a failure to timely recruit and retain key employees would have a material adverse effect on our business 
to be successful  we must attract and retain key technical  sales and managerial employees  including those who join synopsys in connection with acquisitions 
there are a limited number of qualified eda and ic design engineers  and competition for these individuals is intense 
our employees are often recruited aggressively by our competitors and our customers 
in addition  a reorganization of our operations to better address customer needs  improve operational efficiency or reduce expenses may lead to the loss of key employees 
any failure to recruit and retain key technical  sales and managerial employees would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we issue stock options and restricted stock units and maintain employee stock purchase plans as a key component of our overall compensation 
there is growing pressure on public companies from stockholders  who must approve any increases in our equity pool  generally to reduce our overhang or amount of outstanding and unexercised stock options 
in addition  recent accounting rules that require us to recognize on our income statement compensation expense from employee equity grants and our employee stock purchase plan have increased pressure to limit equity grants 
these factors may make it more difficult for synopsys to grant attractive equity based packages in the future  which could adversely impact our ability to attract and retain key employees 
product errors or defects could expose us to liability and harm our reputation 
despite extensive testing prior to releasing our products  software products frequently contain errors or defects  especially when first introduced  when new versions are released or when integrated with technologies developed by acquired companies 
product errors could affect the performance or interoperability of our products  could delay the development or release of new products or new versions of products and could adversely affect market acceptance or perception of our products 
in addition  allegations of ic manufacturability issues resulting from use of our ip products could  even if untrue  adversely affect our reputation and our customers willingness to license ip products from us 
any such errors or delays in releasing new products or new versions of products or allegations of unsatisfactory performance could cause us to lose customers  increase our service costs  subject us to liability for damages and divert our resources from other tasks  any one of which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
catastrophic events may disrupt our business 
we rely on our network infrastructure and enterprise applications  and technology systems for our development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
a disruption or failure of these systems in the event of a major earthquake  fire  telecommunications failure  cyber attack  terrorist attack  or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions  delays in our product development and loss of critical data and could prevent us from fulfilling our customers orders 
our corporate headquarters  a significant portion of our research and development activities  our data centers  and certain other critical business operations are located in california  near major earthquake faults 
we believe we have developed sufficient disaster recovery plans and backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events  but a catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and  as a result  our future operating results could be adversely affected

item legal proceedings irs revenue agent s report on june   we received a revenue agent s report rar in which the internal revenue service irs proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years and of approximately million  plus interest

please also see the cautionary language at the beginning of part of this report regarding forward looking statements 
business environment we generate substantially all of our revenue from customers in the semiconductor and electronics industries 
our customers typically fund purchases of our software and services largely out of their research and development r d budgets and  to a lesser extent  their manufacturing and capital budgets 
as a result  our customers business outlook and willingness to invest in new and increasingly complex chip designs heavily influence our business 
since the through semiconductor downturn and subsequent recovery  our customers have focused significantly on expense reductions  including in their r d budgets 
this expense outlook has affected us in a number of ways 
first  some customers have reduced their eda expenditures by decreasing their level of eda tool purchases  using older generations of eda products or by not renewing maintenance services 
second  customers bargain more intensely on pricing and payment terms  which has affected revenues industry wide 
for example  customers desire to conserve cash by paying for licenses over time resulted in us shifting our business model in the fourth quarter of to a model in which a substantial portion of our software license revenue in any particular period results from revenue recognized over time rather than upfront at the time of shipment 
this shift adversely affected our total revenue in fiscal and third  some customers are consolidating their eda purchases with fewer suppliers in order to lower their overall cost of ownership while at the same time meeting new technology challenges 
this has increased competition among eda vendors 
recognizing that our customers will continue to spend cautiously and will work to aggressively contain costs  we are intensely focused on improving our customers overall economics of design by providing more fully integrated design solutions and offering customers the opportunity to consolidate their eda spending with us 
over the long term  we believe eda industry spending growth will continue to depend on growth in semiconductor r d spending and on continued growth in the overall semiconductor market 
fiscal financial performance summary total revenue was  million  up from  million in fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to increased bookings of tsls in prior periods which increase time based revenue recognized in later periods  reflecting the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal time based license revenue of  million  up from million in fiscal  is attributable to increased bookings of tsls in prior periods which increase time based revenue recognized in later periods  reflecting the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal upfront license revenue of million  up from million in fiscal  reflects fluctuations in customer license type requirements for licenses generating upfront revenue 
we derived approximately of our software license revenue from license arrangements generating time based revenues  maintenance and services  and from licenses generating upfront revenue in fiscal  versus approximately and  respectively  in fiscal this reflects our adherence to our business model 
maintenance revenue was million  down from million in fiscal this decrease in maintenance revenue is primarily attributable to the business model shift and the transition to more tsls for which maintenance is bundled and not charged separately 
the decline is also attributable  to a lesser extent  by the non renewal of maintenance by some of our existing perpetual license customers 
professional service and other revenue of million up from million in fiscal  increased primarily due to the timing and acceptance of performed milestones under existing service contracts 
net income was million compared to million in fiscal the increase in net income is primarily due to increased bookings of tsls in prior periods  which increased revenue in the current period  as well as cost control efforts 
we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an average price of per share for a total of approximately million 
net cash provided by operations increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase is attributable mainly to higher net income  increased collections as a result of payments received from a significant customer  a litigation settlement of million received from magma design automation magma  decreased commission payments  and timing of payments to vendors 
fiscal  and acquisitions we have acquired a number of companies or their assets in recent years  and as part of our efforts to expand our product and services offerings we expect to make additional acquisitions in the future

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial results under the heading result of operations below are based on our audited consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing these financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and net income 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates 
for further information on our significant accounting policies  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the accounting policies that most frequently require us to make assumptions  judgments and estimates  and therefore are critical to understanding our results of operations  are revenue recognition  valuation of share based compensation  valuation of intangible assets  and income taxes revenue recognition we recognize revenue from software licenses and related maintenance and service revenue 
software license revenue consists of fees associated with the licensing of our software 
maintenance and service revenue consists of maintenance fees associated with perpetual and term licenses and professional service fees 
we have designed and implemented revenue recognition policies in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
with respect to software licenses  we utilize three license types technology subscription licenses tsls  are time based licenses for a finite term  and generally provide the customer limited rights to receive  or to exchange certain quantities of licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
we bundle and do not charge separately for post contract customer support maintenance for the term of the license 
term licenses  are also for a finite term  but do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually for the balance of the term 
the annual maintenance fee is typically calculated as a percentage of the net license fee 
perpetual licenses  continue as long as the customer renews maintenance plus an additional years 
perpetual licenses do not provide the customer any rights to receive  or to exchange licensed software for  unspecified future technology 
customers purchase maintenance separately for the first year and may renew annually 
for the three software license types  we recognize revenue as follows tsls 
we typically recognize revenue from tsl fees which include bundled maintenance ratably over the term of the license period  or as customer installments become due and payable  whichever is later 
revenue attributable to tsls is reported as time based revenue in the statement of operations 
term licenses 
we recognize revenue from term licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the term license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue attributable to these term licenses is reported as upfront license revenue in the statement of operations 
for term licenses in which less than of the term license fee is due within one year from shipment  we recognize revenue as customer installments become due and payable 
such revenue is reported as time based revenue in the statement of operations 
perpetual licenses 
we recognize revenue from perpetual licenses in full upon shipment of the software if payment terms require the customer to pay at least of the perpetual license fee within one year from shipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as upfront revenue in the statement of operations 
for perpetual licenses in which less than of the license fee is payable within one year from shipment  we recognize the revenue as customer installments become due and payable 
revenue attributable to these perpetual licenses is reported as time based revenue in the statement of operations 
in addition  we recognize revenue from maintenance fees associated with term and perpetual licenses ratably over the maintenance period and recognize revenue from professional service and training fees as such services are performed and accepted by the customer 
revenue attributable to maintenance  professional services and training is reported as service revenue in the statement of operations 
our determination of fair value of each element in multiple element arrangements is based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
we limit our assessment of vsoe for each element to the price charged when such element is sold separately 
we have analyzed all of the elements included in our multiple element software arrangements and have determined that we have sufficient vsoe to allocate revenue to the maintenance components of our perpetual and term license products and to professional services 
accordingly  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  we recognize license revenue from perpetual and term licenses upon delivery using the residual method  we recognize revenue from maintenance ratably over the maintenance term  and we recognize revenue from professional services as the related services are performed and accepted 
we recognize revenue from tsls ratably over the term of the license  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met  since there is not sufficient vsoe to allocate the tsl fee between license and maintenance services 
we make significant judgments related to revenue recognition 
specifically  in connection with each transaction involving our products  we must evaluate whether persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery of software or services has occurred  the fee for such software or services is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the full license or service fee is probable 
all four of these criteria must be met in order for us to recognize revenue with respect to a particular arrangement 
we apply these revenue recognition criteria as follows 
persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists 
prior to recognizing revenue on an arrangement  our customary policy is to have a written contract  signed by both the customer and us or a purchase order from those customers that have previously negotiated a standard end user license arrangement or purchase agreement 
delivery has occurred 
we deliver software to our customers physically or electronically 
for physical deliveries  the standard transfer terms are typically fob shipping point 
for electronic deliveries  delivery occurs when we provide the customer access codes  or license keys  that allow the customer to take immediate possession of the software by downloading it to the customer s hardware 
we generally ship our software products or license keys promptly after acceptance of customer orders 
however  a number of factors can affect the timing of product shipments and  as a result  timing of revenue recognition  including the delivery dates requested by customers and our operational capacity to fulfill software license orders at the end of a quarter 
the fee is fixed or determinable 
our determination that an arrangement fee is fixed or determinable depends principally on the arrangement s payment terms 
our standard payment terms for perpetual and term licenses require or more of the arrangement fee to be paid within one year 
if the arrangement includes these terms  we regard the fee as fixed or determinable  and recognize all license revenue under the arrangement in full upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
if the arrangement does not include these terms  we do not consider the fee to be fixed or determinable and generally recognize revenue when customer installments are due and payable 
in the case of a tsl  we recognize revenue ratably even if the fee is fixed or determinable  due to the fact that vsoe for maintenance services does not exist for a tsl and due to revenue recognition criteria relating to arrangements that include rights to exchange products or receive unspecified future technology 
collectibility is probable 
we judge collectibility of the arrangement fees on a customer by customer basis pursuant to our credit review policy 
we typically sell to customers with whom we have a history of successful collection 
for a new customer  or when an existing customer substantially expands its commitments to us  we evaluate the customer s financial position and ability to pay and typically assign a credit limit based on that review 
we increase the credit limit only after we have established a successful collection history with the customer 
if we determine at any time that collectibility is not probable under a particular arrangement based upon our credit review process or the customer s payment history  we recognize revenue under that arrangement as customer payments are actually received 
valuation of share based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under sfas no 
r  stock based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan awards 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various subjective assumptions including expected volatility  expected term and the risk free interest rates 
we estimate the expected volatility by a combination of implied volatility for publicly traded options of our stock with a term of six months or longer and the historical stock price volatility over the estimated expected term of our share based awards 
we determine the expected term of our share based awards based on historical experience 
in addition  judgment is also required in estimating the forfeiture rate on share based awards 
we calculate the expected forfeiture rate based on average historical trends 
these input factors are subjective and are determined using management s judgment 
if a difference arises between the assumptions used in determining share based compensation cost and the actual factors which become known over time  we may change the input factors used in determining future share based compensation costs 
any such changes could materially impact our results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and in periods thereafter 
valuation of intangible assets 
we evaluate our intangible assets for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
intangible assets consist of purchased technology  contract rights intangibles  customer installed base relationships  trademarks and trade names  covenants not to compete  customer backlog  capitalized software and other intangibles 
factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if this evaluation indicates that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  we make an assessment of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset over its remaining useful life 
if this assessment indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the technology over the remaining amortization period  we reduce the net carrying value of the related intangible asset to fair value and may adjust the remaining amortization period 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results 
we did not record any impairment charges on our intangible assets during fiscal as of october   the carrying amount of our intangible assets  net was million 
income taxes 
we calculate our current and deferred tax provisions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
our estimates and assumptions used in such provisions may differ from the actual results as reflected in our income tax returns and we record the required adjustments when they are identified and resolved 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the book and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which we expect the differences to reverse 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years and our forecast of future taxable income on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  as well as feasible and prudent tax planning strategies 
these assumptions require significant judgment about the forecasts of future taxable income and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we believe that the net deferred tax assets of million that are recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized 
however  if we determine in the future that it is more likely than not we will not be able to realize a portion or the full amount of deferred tax assets  we would record an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance as a charge to earnings in the period such determination is made 
included in our net deferred tax assets are federal foreign tax credits of million of which million will expire from fiscal through and the remaining million in foreign tax credits from acquired companies  which have a valuation allowance of million  will expire between fiscal and foreign tax credits can only be carried forward ten years  unlike net operating loss and federal research credit carryforwards that have a twenty year carryforward period 
our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period 
our ability to maintain the deferred tax credit requires significant judgment in forecasting our future foreign source income 
we have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
if the cumulative foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future  we would provide for taxes on such excess amount 
as of october   there was approximately million of earnings upon which us income taxes have not been provided 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves the inherent uncertainty associated with the application of complex tax laws 
we are also subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
we believe we have adequately provided in our financial statements for potential additional taxes 
if we ultimately determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary  we would reverse the liability and recognize the tax benefit in the period in which we determine that the liability is no longer necessary 
if an ultimate tax assessment exceeds our estimate of tax liabilities  we would record an additional charge to earnings 
see results of operations income taxes irs revenue agent s report  below  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of a revenue agent s report from the internal revenue service irs we received in june asserting a very large net increase to our us tax arising from the audit of fiscal years and results of operations revenue background we generate our revenue from the sale of software licenses  maintenance and professional services 
under current accounting rules and policies  we recognize revenue from orders we receive for software licenses and services at varying times 
in most instances  we recognize revenue on a tsl software license order quarterly over the license term and on a term or perpetual software license order in the quarter in which the license is shipped 
substantially all of our current time based licenses are tsls with an average license term of approximately three years 
maintenance orders normally bring in revenue ratably over the maintenance period normally one year 
professional service orders generally turns into revenue upon completion and customer acceptance of contractually agreed milestones 
a more complete description of our revenue recognition policy can be found above under critical accounting policies and estimates 
our revenue in any fiscal quarter is equal to the sum of our time based license  upfront license  maintenance and professional service revenue for the period 
we derive time based license revenue in any quarter almost entirely from tsl orders received and delivered in prior quarters 
we derive upfront license revenue directly from term and perpetual license orders mostly booked and shipped during the quarter 
we derive maintenance revenue in any quarter largely from maintenance orders received in prior quarters since our maintenance orders generally yield revenue ratably over a term of one year 
we also derive professional service revenue primarily from orders received in prior quarters  since we recognize revenue from professional services when those services are delivered and accepted  not when they are booked 
our license revenue is very sensitive to the mix of tsls and perpetual or term licenses delivered during a reporting period 
a tsl order typically yields lower current quarter revenue but contributes to revenue in future periods 
for example  a  order for a three year tsl shipped on the last day of a quarter typically generates no revenue in that quarter  but  in each of the twelve succeeding quarters 
conversely  perpetual licenses and term licenses with greater than of the license fee due within one year from shipment typically generate current quarter revenue but no future revenue eg  a  order for a perpetual license generates  in revenue in the quarter the product is shipped  but no future revenue 
total revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions the increase in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased bookings of licenses generating time based revenue reflecting the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the transition to more tsls in prior periods that continue to contribute to time based license revenue in later periods  and the fact that fiscal had weeks compared to weeks in fiscal  resulting in one week s additional time based revenue being recognized in fiscal the increase was partially offset by a decrease in maintenance and service revenue 
in future periods when each of the comparative periods refects full maturity of our business model shift to a model with substantially more time based revenue  we expect that the model change itself will no longer contribute to the increases in total revenue or time based revenue 
the increase in total revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to an increase in time based license revenue from orders booked in prior periods which more than offset a decrease in maintenance and service revenue during the fiscal time based license revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in time based revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to increased bookings of tsls in prior periods which increased time based revenue recognized in later periods  the business model shift in the fourth quarter of fiscal and transition to more tsls in prior periods that continue to contribute to time based license revenue in later periods  and the fact that fiscal had weeks compared to weeks in fiscal  resulting in one week s additional time based revenue being recognized in fiscal in future periods when each of the comparative periods refects full maturity of our business model shift to a model with substantially more time based revenue  we expect that the model change itself will no longer contribute to the increases in total revenue or time based revenue 
the increase in time based license revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily reflects the continuation of our highly time based revenue model  under which previously booked orders continue to contribute to revenue in later periods  combined with increased business levels in earlier quarters 
upfront license revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the slight increase in upfront license revenue for fiscal compared to fiscal and for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to changes in customer license type requirements during the year and did not change significantly which is consistent with our shift towards tsls 
maintenance and service revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions maintenance revenue professional service and other revenue total percentage of total revenue our maintenance revenue has declined in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily due to our shift towards tsls  which bundles maintenance with the license fee and thus generates no separately recognized maintenance revenue  as well as non renewal of maintenance by some customers on perpetual or term licenses 
some customers may choose in the future not to renew maintenance on perpetual or term licenses for economic or other factors  which would also adversely affect future maintenance revenue 
professional service and other revenue increased in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal due to timing and acceptance of performance milestones under existing service contracts 
events affecting cost of revenues and operating expenses functional allocation of operating expenses 
we allocate certain human resource programs  information technology and facility expenses among our functional income statement categories based on headcount within each functional area 
annually  or upon a significant change in headcount such as a workforce reduction  realignment or acquisition or other factors  management reviews the allocation methodology and the expenses included in the allocation pool 
week fiscal year 
fiscal is a week fiscal year compared to a week in fiscal years and cost of revenue year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions cost of license revenue cost of maintenance and service revenue amortization of intangible assets total percentage of total revenue we divide cost of revenue into three categories cost of license revenue  cost of maintenance and service revenue  and amortization of intangible assets 
we segregate expenses directly associated with providing consulting and training from cost of license revenue associated with internal functions which provide license delivery and post customer contract support services 
we then allocate these group costs between cost of license revenue and cost of maintenance and service revenue based on license and service revenue reported during the quarter 
cost of license revenue 
cost of license revenue includes costs associated with the sale and licensing of our software products 
additionally  cost of license revenue also includes allocated costs of license delivery  such as employee salaries and benefits related to software delivery  software production costs  product packaging  amortization of capitalized software development costs  documentation and royalties to third party vendors 
cost of maintenance and service revenue 
cost of maintenance and service revenue includes employee salary and benefits for consulting professionals and associated costs to maintain the infrastructure necessary to operate our services and training organization 
further  cost of maintenance and service revenue also includes allocated costs which provide post customer contract services such as employee salary and benefits related to customer services  such as hotline and on site support  production services and documentation of maintenance updates 
amortization of intangible assets 
see amortization of intangible assets below for information regarding the amount of amortization charged to cost of revenue for the relevant periods 
the increase in total cost of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in compensation and employee benefits due to our increased personnel costs and as a result of acquisitions in fiscal and in late fiscal  an increase of million in direct costs as a result of increased shipments during fiscal  weeks of costs in fiscal instead of weeks in fiscal  and million increase in human resources  information technology and facilities costs  allocated to this line item 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in amortization of certain intangible assets as a result of intangible assets acquired in prior years becoming fully amortized during fiscal the decrease in total cost of revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the decrease of million in amortization of intangible assets resulting from completion of amortization of certain intangible assets primarily acquired in the acquisition of avant corporation in june this decrease was partially offset by increases of recognition of million in share based compensation expense due to adoption of sfas r  million in compensation and employee benefits due to our increased personnel costs and as a result of acquisitions including million in compensation to former integrated systems engineering ag employees based on achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones  and million in corporate allocated expenses including human resources  information technology and facilities costs  allocated to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal as a result of increased allocable expenses 
operating expenses research and development year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in increased personnel and related costs as a result of acquisitions in fiscal and in late fiscal  in addition to an extra week of expense in fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in share based compensation expense  a decrease of million in general operational activities such as expenses for travel  entertainment  communications  depreciation  and to a lesser extent by reductions in corporate wide allocable expenses  including human resources  information technology and facilities costs  allocated to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal the increase in research and development expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to recognition of million in share based compensation expense due to adoption of sfas r  an increase of million in research and development personnel related costs as a result of acquisitions including million in compensation due to former ise employees now employed by synopsys based upon achievement of certain sales and employee retention milestones  and an increase of million in corporate allocated expenses  including human resources  information technology and facilities costs  allocated to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal as a result of increased corporate wide allocable expenses 
sales and marketing year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the increase in sales and marketing expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to an increase of million in variable compensation as a result of increased shipments  and an increase of million in sales and marketing personnel related costs  employee functions and an extra week of expense in fiscal this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in general operation activities such as travel  entertainment  communications  depreciation and a million reduction in corporate wide allocable expenses  including human resources  information technology and facilities costs  allocated to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a million reduction in variable compensation driven by shipments  a million reduction in sales and marketing personnel related costs due to reductions in headcount  and the absence in fiscal of million in costs associated with a reduction in force made during fiscal this decrease was partially offset by recognition of million in share based compensation expense due to adoption of sfas r  and an increase of million in corporate allocated expenses  including human resources  information technology and facilities costs  allocated to this line item compared to the same period in fiscal as a result of increased allocable expenses 
general and administrative year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions percentage of total revenue the decrease in general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease of million in expenses related to professional services primarily for legal  sarbanes oxley act compliance  tax and audit matters  a decrease of million in depreciation expense as a result of improving efficiencies in our operations and cost control efforts  and a gain of million  net of related expenses  for a land sale recorded as an offset to expense under this line 
these decreases were offset by an increase of million in expense related to facility operations and a net increase of million in corporate allocated expenses  including human resources  information technology and facilities costs  allocated to this line item 
the increase in general and administrative expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a recognition of million in share based compensation expense due to adoption of sfas r  an increase of million in facilities costs and property taxes  an increase of million in professional services expenses related to litigation matters  audit services  sarbanes oxley act compliance and tax services  an increase of million as a result of reduction in bad debt reserve taken in fiscal in excess of those taken in fiscal  and an increase of million in telecommunication and networking expenses

in process research and development in process research and development iprd expense is comprised of in process technologies of million associated with the acquisitions of archpro and sandwork in fiscal  million associated with the acquisition of hpl in fiscal and million associated with the acquisition of ise in fiscal at the date of each acquisition  the projects associated with the iprd efforts had not yet reached technological feasibility and the research and development in process had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these amounts were charged to expense on the respective acquisition date of each of the acquired companies 
valuation of iprd 
upon acquisition of other companies  we expense any acquired in process research and development iprd as it represents incomplete research and development projects that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the acquisition date 
the value assigned to iprd is determined by considering the importance of each project to our overall development plan  estimating costs to develop the iprd into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from such projects when completed and discounting the net cash flows back to their present value 
the utilized discount rate is our weighted average cost of capital  taking into account the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates and the profitability of such technology  the successful development of the iprd  its useful life and the uncertainty of technological advances  all of which are unknown at the time of determination 
sandwork 
on october   we acquired sandwork design  inc sandwork  a company providing tools to efficiently analyze and debug complex analog mixed signal ams systems on chips socs

amortization of intangible assets 
amortization of intangible assets includes the amortization of the contract rights associated with certain executory contracts and the amortization of core developed technology  trademarks  trade names  customer relationships  covenants not to compete  and other intangibles related to acquisitions completed in prior years 
amortization expense is included in the consolidated statements of operations as follows year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions included in cost of revenue included in operating expenses total percentage of total revenue amortization of capitalized software development costs is included in cost of license revenue in the consolidated statements of operations 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to completion of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in prior year s acquisitions 
the decrease in amortization of intangible assets in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to completion of amortization of certain intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of avant see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a schedule of future amortization amounts which information is incorporated by reference here 
impairment of intangible assets 
there were no impairment charges related to intangible assets during fiscal years  or other income  net year ended october  change change change change to to dollars in millions interest income  net income loss on assets related to executive deferred compensation plan gain loss on sale of investments  net of investment write downs foreign currency exchange gain loss correction of an error in accounting for certain hedging transactions other total for fiscal  the amount included a litigation settlement of million received from magma 
for fiscal year  the amount included a million litigation settlement gain relating to the acquisition of nassda 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we re evaluated our interpretation of certain provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging sfas  resulting in the discovery of an error in the application of the standard to certain prior year foreign currency hedge transactions 
the effect of the error was not material in any prior period and did not impact the economics of our hedging program 
to correct the error  we reclassified the remaining million related to the disallowed hedges from accumulated other comprehensive loss to other income in fiscal year see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes income taxes 
the relative proportions of our domestic and foreign revenue and income directly affect our effective tax rate 
we are also subject to changing tax laws in the multiple jurisdictions in which we operate 
as of october   current deferred tax assets  net of current deferred tax liabilities  totaled million 
non current deferred tax assets  net of non current deferred tax liabilities  totaled million 
we believe it is more likely than not that our results of future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to utilize our net deferred tax assets 
we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for any valuation allowance  and if we determine we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would record a charge to income and an adjustment to the deferred tax assets in the period we make that determination 
included in our net deferred tax assets are federal foreign tax credits of million of which million will expire from fiscal through and the remaining million in foreign tax credits from acquired companies  which have a valuation allowance of million  will expire between fiscal and foreign tax credits can only be carried forward ten years  unlike net operating loss and federal research credit carryforwards that have a twenty year carryforward period 
our ability to utilize foreign tax credits is dependent upon having sufficient foreign source income during the carryforward period 
we have not provided taxes for undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries because we plan to reinvest such earnings indefinitely outside the united states 
if the cumulative foreign earnings exceed the amount we intend to reinvest in foreign countries in the future  we would provide taxes on such excess amount 
as of october   there was approximately million of earnings upon which income taxes have not been provided 
effective tax rate 
the following table presents the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rates for the fiscal years ended october   and year ended october  dollars in millions income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income tax effective tax rate the tax rate is lower than primarily due to lower withholding taxes as a result of restructuring of certain of our foreign operations  and increased research credits 
the effective tax rate includes a non recurring benefit of million related to the reenactment of the federal research credit  retroactive to january  for fiscal year  the effective tax rate includes state tax expense of million for prior year state taxes  primarily as a result of state tax audits settled and a settlement offer made in fiscal and associated interest and penalties  as well as a reduction in an estimated fiscal state research and development credit benefit 
we recorded no tax benefit in the fiscal years ended october  and for expenses relating to the vesting of qualified stock options and share based compensation costs which are borne by certain of our foreign subsidiaries 
for fiscal year  the effective tax rate includes the impact of million tax expense associated with repatriation of approximately million of foreign earnings under the provisions of the american jobs creation act of in may  the tax increase prevention and reconciliation act of was enacted  which provides a three year exception to current us taxation of certain foreign intercompany income 
this provision first applied to synopsys in fiscal year in december  the tax relief and health care act of was enacted  which retroactively extended the research and development credit from january  as a result  we increased our fiscal research and development credit by million in fiscal tax effects of stock awards 
in november  fasb issued a staff position fsp on fas r  transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share based payment awards 
effective upon issuance  this fsp describes an alternative transition method for calculating the tax effects of share based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the tax effects of employee stock based compensation  and to determine the subsequent impact on the apic pool and the statement of cash flows of the tax effects of employee share based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
we elected to use the alternative transition method in fiscal and have not recognized any excess tax benefits during fiscal and irs revenue agent s report 
on june   we received a revenue agent s report rar in which the internal revenue service irs proposed to assess a net tax deficiency for fiscal years and of approximately million  plus interest 
this proposed adjustment primarily relates to transfer pricing transactions between synopsys and a wholly owned foreign subsidiary 
we strongly believe the proposed irs adjustment and resulting proposed deficiency are inconsistent with applicable tax laws  and that we thus have meritorious defenses to this proposed irs adjustment 
on july   we filed a protest to the proposed deficiency with the irs  which caused the matter to be referred to the appeals division of the irs 
in december  we reached a tentative settlement with the appeals division that would resolve this dispute 
the settlement is subject to further review and approval within the government  which we expect will take several more months  but we believe that settlement is likely 
if the settlement becomes final on the tentative terms agreed upon  then we have already adequately provided for this matter 
final resolution of this matter could take considerable time or may not be finally approved by the government  in which case  while we believe we are still adequately provided for regarding this matter  there is still a possibility that an adverse outcome of the matter could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in the third quarter of  the irs started an examination of our federal income tax returns for the years through as of the end of fiscal  no adjustments had been proposed as a result of this audit which would require an adjustment to the tax provision 
repatriation of foreign earnings 
in fiscal  we recorded tax expense of million related to the repatriation of million  pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the jobs creation act which provides for a special one time elective dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a us taxpayer equal to of the eligible distribution 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are funds generated from our business operations and funds that may be drawn down under our credit facility 
the following sections discuss changes in our balance sheet and cash flows  and other commitments on our liquidity and capital resources during fiscal cash and cash equivalents and short term investments october  change change dollars in millions cash and cash equivalents short term investments total during the year ended october   our primary sources and uses of cash consisted of cash provided by operating activities of million  proceeds from issuance of common stock to employees of million  proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments of million  proceeds from sale of land of million  repurchases of common stock of million  purchases of investments of million  purchases of property and equipment of million  and cash paid for acquisitions and intangible assets of million 
cash flows year ended october  change change dollars in millions cash provided by operations cash used in investing activities cash provided by used for financing activities cash provided by operating activities 
cash provided by operations is dependent primarily upon the payment terms of our license agreements 
to be classified as upfront revenue  we require that of a term or perpetual license fee be paid within the first year 
conversely  payment terms for tsls are generally extended and the license fee is typically paid either quarterly or annually in even increments over the term of the license 
accordingly  we generally receive cash from upfront license revenue much sooner than from time based licenses revenue 
cash provided by operating activities increased primarily due to increased collections largely as a result of payments received from a significant customer  a litigation settlement of million received from magma during fiscal  and decreased commission payments and timing of payments to vendors compared to the same period in cash used in investing activities 
the increase in cash used primarily relates to acquisitions  purchases of marketable securities related to our increased collections and the timing of maturities of marketable securities  and our capital expenditures to support our information technology infrastructure  partially offset by cash received for the sale of land in san jose for million  net of related fees 
cash provided by used in financing activities 
the increase in cash provided primarily relates to a higher amount of option exercises by employees and lower stock repurchases under our stock repurchase program compared to the same period in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the stock repurchase program 
we hold our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in the united states and in foreign accounts  primarily in ireland  bermuda  and japan 
as of october   we held an aggregate of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in the united states and an aggregate of million in foreign accounts 
funds in foreign accounts are generated from revenue outside north america 
at present  such foreign funds are considered to be indefinitely reinvested in foreign countries 
see income taxes above 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including timing of our billings and collections  our operating results  the timing and amount of tax and other liability payments and cash used in any future acquisitions 
accounts receivable  net october  change change dollars in millions our accounts receivable and days sales outstanding dso are primarily driven by our billing and collections activities 
our dso was days at october  and days at october  the decrease in dso along with a slight increase in accounts receivable balance primarily relates to our strong collection efforts and timing of billings to customers that occurred during the year with subsequent payment terms 
net working capital 
working capital is comprised of current assets less current liabilities  as shown on our unaudited condensed consolidated balance sheets 
as of october   our net working capital was million  compared to million as of october  the increase of million was primarily due to an increase of million in cash and cash equivalents including proceeds from sale of land and the magma litigation settlement  an increase in short term investments of million  an increase in income taxes receivable and deferred taxes of million  and an increase in prepaid and other of million 
this increase was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of million  accounts payable and accrued liabilities of  and income taxes payable of million 
other commitments revolving credit facility 
on october   we entered into a five year  million senior unsecured revolving credit facility providing for loans to synopsys and certain of its foreign subsidiaries 
the amount of the facility may be increased by up to an additional million through the fourth year of the facility 
the facility contains financial covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum leverage ratio and specified levels of cash  as well as other non financial covenants 
the facility terminates on october  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or the federal funds rate plus  however  we have the option to pay interest based on the outstanding amount at eurodollar rates plus a spread between and based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant 
in addition  commitment fees are payable on the facility at rates between and per year based on a pricing grid tied to a financial covenant 
as of october  we had no outstanding borrowings under this credit facility and were in compliance with all covenants 
we believe that our current cash  cash equivalents  short term investments  cash generated from operations  and available credit under our credit facility will satisfy our business requirements for at least the next twelve months 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of october  total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter in thousands long term obligations   lease obligations capital lease    operating leases     purchase obligations    total      this commitment relates to the fees associated with the revolving credit facility

additional information is provided in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
purchase obligations represent an estimate of all open purchase orders and contractual obligations in the ordinary course of business for which we have not received the goods or services as of october  although open purchase orders are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow us the option to cancel  reschedule and adjust our requirements based on our business needs prior to the delivery of goods or performance of services 
in connection with our acquisitions completed prior to october   we may be obligated to pay up to an aggregate of million in cash during the next months and an additional million in cash during the two years subsequent to fiscal if certain performance and milestone goals are achieved 
because these commitments are contingent on certain performance and milestone goals  these amounts are not reflected in the table above 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payment and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
amounts disclosed as contingent or milestone based obligations depend on the achievement of the milestones or the occurrence of the contingent events and can vary significantly 
as of october   we did not have any significant off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k
