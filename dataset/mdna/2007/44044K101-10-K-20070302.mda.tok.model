executive overview year ended december  year ended december  twelve months ended december  in thousands operating revenue operating expense operating income operating ratio revenue containers units operating revenue increased by million or for the year ended december  from the year ended december  this revenue growth is primarily attributable to rate improvements resulting from favorable changes in cargo mix  general rate increases  increased bunker fuel and intermodal fuel surcharges to help offset increases in fuel costs  and revenue increases from non transportation and other revenue services 
this revenue increase is offset partially by lower container volumes primarily attributable to soft market conditions in puerto rico 
operating expenses increased by million or for the year ended december  from the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses is primarily due to increases in vessel fuel expense and rail and truck transportation costs as a result of increases in fuel prices  offset by a decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses and other variable operating expenses 
the decline in selling  general  and administrative expenses is primarily due to lower stock based compensation charges  the elimination of the castle harlan management fee  and a decrease in variable operating costs as a result of lower revenue container volumes shipped 
operating revenue increased by million or for the year ended december  from the twelve months ended december  this revenue growth is primarily attributable to rate improvements resulting from favorable changes in cargo mix  general rate increases  increased bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges to help offset significant increases in fuel costs  and revenue increases from non transportation and other revenue services 
this revenue increase is offset slightly by lower container volumes due to weeks in the twelve months ended december  compared to weeks in the year ended december  operating expenses increased by million or for the year ended december  from the twelve months ended december  factors contributing to the increase in operating expense include significant increases in vessel fuel expense and rail and truck transportation costs as a result of increases in fuel prices  and higher depreciation and amortization costs due to the purchase price accounting step up in basis of customer contracts and trademarks related to the consummation on july  of the acquisition related transactions 
increases also include a million increase in non cash stock compensation charges as well as charges related to our initial public offering which was completed in the fourth quarter of charges associated with our initial public offering include a million charge related to the termination of the ongoing management services and related fee provisions of a management agreement with castle harlan among other items 
general we believe that we are the nation s leading jones act container shipping and integrated logistics company  accounting for approximately of total us marine container shipments from the continental us to alaska  puerto rico and hawaii  constituting the three non contiguous jones act markets  and to guam 
under the jones act  all vessels transporting cargo between us ports must  subject to limited exceptions  be built in the us  registered under the us flag  manned by predominantly us crews  and owned and operated by us organized companies that are controlled and owned by us citizens 
we operate the largest jones act containership fleet with vessels and approximately  cargo containers

we have long term access to terminal facilities in each of our ports  operating our terminals in alaska  hawaii  and puerto rico and contracting for terminal services in the six ports in the continental us and in the ports in guam  hong kong and taiwan 
history and transactions our long operating history dates back to  when sea land pioneered the marine container shipping industry and established our business 
in  we introduced container shipping to the puerto rico market and in we pioneered container shipping in alaska with the first year round scheduled vessel service 
in  we began providing container shipping services between the us west coast and hawaii and guam through our acquisition from an existing carrier of all of its vessels and certain other assets that were already serving that market 
today  as the only jones act vessel operator with an integrated organization serving alaska  puerto rico  and hawaii  we are uniquely positioned to serve our customers that require shipping and logistics services in more than one of these markets

basis of presentation the company was formed in connection with the acquisition related transactions  and has no independent operations 
consequently  the accompanying consolidated financial statements include the consolidated accounts of the company as of december   december  and december  and for the years ended december  and december  and for the period from july  through december  and of horizon lines holding for the periods from december  through july  the financial statements for periods subsequent to february  but prior to july  have been prepared using horizon lines holding s basis in the assets and liabilities acquired in the february  purchase transaction  determined by applying the purchase method of accounting to such transaction  and the assets and liabilities so acquired were valued on horizon lines holding s books at horizon lines holding s assessment of their fair market value 
the financial statements for periods subsequent to july  have been prepared using the basis of the company in the assets and liabilities deemed acquired by the company in the acquisition related transactions  determined by applying the purchase method of accounting to such transactions  and the assets and liabilities so acquired were valued on the company s books at the company s assessment of their fair market value 
the information for the twelve months ended december  discussed below represents the combined financial information for the appropriate pre acquisition and post acquisition periods to present more meaningful information on a comparative annual basis 
certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform with the current period presentation 
fiscal year we have a or week every sixth or seventh year fiscal year that ends on the sunday before the last friday in december 
the fiscal years ended december  and december  each consisted of weeks 
the twelve months ended december  consisted of weeks 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions in the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and in reporting the amounts of assets and liabilities  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
since many of these estimates and assumptions are based on future events which cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe that the application of our critical accounting policies  and the estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly re evaluated and adjustments are made when facts or circumstances dictate a change 
historically  we have found the application of accounting policies to be appropriate and actual results have not differed materially from those determined using necessary estimates 
revenue recognition we account for transportation revenue based upon method two under emerging issues task force no 
revenue and expense recognition for freight services in process 
under this method we record transportation revenue for the cargo when shipped and an expense accrual for the corresponding costs to complete delivery when the cargo first sails from its point of origin 
we believe that this method of revenue recognition does not result in a material difference in reported net income on an annual or quarterly basis as compared to recording transportation revenue between accounting periods based upon the relative transit time within each respective period with expenses recognized as incurred 
terminal and other service revenue and related costs of sales are recognized as services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts and revenue adjustments the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the expected collectibility of accounts receivable 
the company monitors its collection risk on an ongoing basis through the use of credit reporting agencies 
the company does not require collateral from its trade customers 
in addition  the company maintains an allowance for revenue adjustments consisting of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  when billing errors occur  and when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
these revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction to revenue 
casualty claims we purchase insurance coverage for a portion of our exposure related to certain employee injuries workers compensation and compensation under the longshore and harbor workers compensation act  vehicular and vessel collision  accidents and personal injury and cargo claims 
most insurance arrangements include a level of self insurance self retention or deductible applicable to each claim or vessel voyage  but provide an umbrella policy to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs 
the amounts of self insurance coverage change from time to time 
our current insurance coverage specifies that the self insured limit on claims ranges from  to  our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from our insurance companies to continually update the anticipated residual exposure for each claim 
in establishing accruals and reserves for claims and insurance expenses  we evaluate and monitor each claim individually  and we use factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates to determine the appropriate reserves for potential liability 
changes in the perceived severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of our plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves 
goodwill  purchase costs and other identifiable intangible assets under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  previously recorded goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are subject to annual undiscounted cash flow impairment tests 
if there is an apparent impairment  a new fair value of the reporting unit would be determined 
if the new fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss would be recognized 
customer contracts and trademarks were valued on july   as part of the acquisition related transactions  by an independent third party valuation company using the income appraisal methodology 
the income appraisal methodology includes a determination of the present value of future monetary benefits to be derived from the anticipated income  or ownership  of the subject asset 
the value of our customer contracts includes the value expected to be realized from existing contracts as well as from expected renewals of such contracts and is calculated using unweighted and weighted total undiscounted cash flows as part of the income appraisal methodology 
the value of our trademarks and service marks is based on various factors including the strength of the trade or service name in terms of recognition and generation of pricing premiums and enhanced margins 
we amortize customer contracts and trademarks and service marks on a straight line method over the estimated useful life of nine to fifteen years 
we evaluate these assets annually for potential impairment in accordance with sfas no 
shipping rates we publish tariffs with fixed rates for all three of our jones act trade routes 
these rates are subject to regulation by the surface transportation board stb 
however  in the case of our puerto rico and alaska trade routes  we primarily ship containers on the basis of confidential negotiated transportation service contracts that are not subject to rate regulation by the stb 
vessel drydocking under us coast guard rules  administered through the american bureau of shipping s alternative compliance program  all vessels must meet specified seaworthiness standards to remain in service carrying cargo between us marine terminals 
vessels must undergo regular inspection  monitoring and maintenance  referred to as drydocking  to maintain the required operating certificates 
these drydockings generally occur every two and a half years  or twice every five years 
because drydockings enable the vessel to continue operating in compliance with us coast guard requirements  the costs of these scheduled drydockings are customarily deferred and amortized over a month period beginning with the accounting period following the vessel s release from drydock 
we also take advantage of vessel drydockings to perform normal repair and maintenance procedures on our vessels 
these routine vessel maintenance and repair procedures are expensed as incurred 
in addition  we will occasionally  during a vessel drydocking  replace vessel machinery or equipment and perform procedures that materially enhance capabilities of a vessel 
in these circumstances  the expenditures are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated useful lives 
deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets represent expenses recognized for financial reporting purposes that may result in tax deductions in the future and deferred tax liabilities represent expense recognized for tax purposes that may result in financial reporting expenses in the future 
certain judgments  assumptions and estimates may affect the carrying value of the valuation allowance and income tax expense in the consolidated financial statements 
we record an income tax valuation allowance when the realization of certain deferred tax assets  net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards is not likely 
in conjunction with the election of tonnage tax  we revalued our deferred taxes to accurately reflect the rates at which we expect such items to reverse in future periods 
stock options in conjunction with the initial public offering  we early adopted sfas no 
r sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective approach as of september  sfas r covers a wide range of share based compensation arrangements including stock options  restricted share plans  and employee stock purchase plans 
in applying sfas r  the value of each equity based award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes model takes into account volatility in the price of our stock  the risk free interest rate  the estimated life of the equity based award  the closing market price of our stock and the exercise price 
due to the lack of trading activity since our stock became publicly traded  we base our estimates of stock price volatility on the average of i our historical stock price over the period in which it has been publicly traded and ii historical volatility of similar entities commensurate with the expected term of the equity based award  however  this estimate is neither predictive nor indicative of the future performance of our stock 
the estimates utilized in the black scholes calculation involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those options expected to vest 
property and equipment we capitalize property and equipment as permitted or required by applicable accounting standards  including replacements and improvements when costs incurred for those purposes extend the useful life of the asset 
we charge maintenance and repairs to expense as incurred 
depreciation on capital assets is computed using the straight line method and ranges from to years 
our management makes assumptions regarding future conditions in determining estimated useful lives and potential salvage values 
these assumptions impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in the period and any gain or loss once the asset is disposed 
we evaluate each of our long lived assets for impairment using undiscounted future cash flows relating to those assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
when undiscounted future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the carrying amount of an asset  the asset is written down to its fair value 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas sfas does not change how pensions and other postretirement benefits are accounted for and reported in the income statement 
the required transition method of adoption is a prospective application and recognizing the funded status of a company s benefit plans will require an offsetting adjustment to the ending balance of accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
as discussed above  during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded a decrease to accumulated other comprehensive income of million to reflect the underfunded status of it post retirement and pension plans 
in september  the fasb issued statement no 
sfas  fair value measurements  which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result of sfas there is now a common definition of fair value to be used throughout gaap 
the fasb believes that the new standard will make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable and improve disclosures about those measures 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the company does not believe the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on its statement of operations 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  differences between the amounts recognized in the statements of financial position prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption will be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment recorded to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
the company is in the process of determining the financial impact the adoption of fin will have on its consolidated statement of operations or financial position 
results of operations operating revenue overview we derive our revenue primarily from providing comprehensive shipping and logistics services to and from the continental us and alaska  puerto rico  hawaii and guam 
we charge our customers on a per load basis and price our services based on the length of inland and ocean cargo transportation hauls  type of cargo and other requirements  such as shipment timing and type of container 
in addition  we assess fuel surcharges on a basis consistent with industry practice and at times may incorporate these surcharges into our basic transportation rates 
at times  there is a timing disparity between volatility in our fuel costs and related adjustments to our fuel surcharges or the incorporation of adjusted fuel surcharges into our base transportation rates that may result in insufficient recovery of our fuel costs during sharp hikes in the price of fuel and recoveries in excess of our fuel costs when fuel prices level off or decline 
over of our revenues are generated from our shipping and logistics services in markets where the marine trade is subject to the jones act or other us maritime laws 
the balance of our revenue is derived from i vessel loading and unloading services that we provide for vessel operators at our terminals  ii agency services that we provide for third party shippers lacking administrative presences in our markets  iii vessel space charter income from third parties in trade lanes not subject to the jones act  iv management of vessels owned by third parties  v trucking and warehousing services for third parties  and vi other non transportation services 
as used in this form k  the term revenue containers connotes containers that are transported for a charge as opposed to empty containers 
operating expense overview our operating expenses consist primarily of marine operating costs  inland transportation costs  vessel operating costs  land costs and rolling stock rent 
our marine operating costs consist of stevedoring  port charges  wharfage and various other costs to secure vessels at the port and to load and unload containers to and from vessels 
our inland transportation costs consist primarily of the costs to move containers to and from the port via rail  truck or barge 
our vessel operating costs consist primarily of crew payroll costs and benefits  vessel fuel costs  vessel maintenance costs  space charter costs  vessel insurance costs and vessel rent 
we view our vessel fuel costs as subject to potential fluctuation as a result of changes in unit prices in the fuel market 
our vessel fuel consumption has been generally constant for corresponding years or corresponding interim periods  since the number of active vessels  voyages and destinations have generally been the same for corresponding years or corresponding interim periods 
our land costs consist primarily of maintenance  yard and gate operations  warehousing operations and terminal overhead in the terminals in which we operate 
rolling stock rent consists primarily of rent for street tractors  yard equipment  chassis  gensets and various dry and refrigerated containers

operating revenue increased to  million for the year ended december  from  million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this revenue increase can be attributed to the following factors in thousands revenue container volume decrease more favorable cargo mix and general rate increases bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges included in rates to offset rising fuel costs growth in other non transportation services total operating revenue increase the decreased revenue due to revenue container volume declines for the year ended december  is primarily due to overall soft market conditions in puerto rico as well as a strategic shift away from lower margin automobile cargo to more refrigerated cargo and other higher margin freight 
the temporary government shutdown in puerto rico and uncertainty surrounding tax reform contributed to the continued soft market conditions 
this revenue container volume decrease is offset by higher margin cargo mix in addition to general rate increases 
bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges  which are included in our transportation revenue  accounted for approximately of total revenue in the year ended december  and approximately of total revenue in the year ended december  we increased our bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges several times throughout and  as a result of significant increases in the cost of fuel for our vessels and as a result of fuel increases passed on to us by our truck  rail  and barge carriers 
fuel surcharges are evaluated regularly as the price of fuel fluctuates  and we may at times incorporate these surcharges into the base transportation rates that we charge 
the growth in other non transportation services is primarily due to increases in terminal services provided to third parties  offset slightly by a decrease in equipment rental income 
operating expense 
operating expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in operating expense primarily reflects the effect of rising fuel prices  and an increase in rolling stock rent  offset by lower expenses associated with lower container volumes 
vessel expense  which is not primarily driven by revenue container volume  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this million increase can be attributed to the following factors in thousands increased vessel fuel costs reduction of vessel lease expense due to vessel purchases labor and other vessel operating decreases decrease in construction differential subsidy total vessel expense increase the million increase in fuel expense is comprised of an increase of million due to a increase in fuel prices  offset by a decrease of million due to lower fuel consumption 
the decrease in vessel lease expense is due to the purchase of the horizon enterprise and the horizon pacific in september  offset by lease expense incurred during for the horizon hunter 
the decrease in vessel labor and other operating expenses is primarily due to operating one less vessel in puerto rico during most of marine expense is comprised of the costs incurred to bring vessels into and out of port  and to load and unload containers 
the types of costs included in marine expense are stevedoring and benefits  pilotage fees  tug fees  government fees  wharfage fees  dockage fees  and line handler fees 
marine expense decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
this decrease in marine expenses can be attributed to a decrease in total revenue container volume period over period  offset by contractual labor increases 
inland expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
approximately million of this increase is due to higher fuel costs  as rail  truck  and barge carriers have substantially increased their fuel surcharges period over period 
the remaining increase is due to rate increases offset by lower volumes 
land expense is comprised of the costs included within the terminal for the handling  maintenance and storage of containers  including yard operations  gate operations  maintenance  warehouse and terminal overhead 
land expense was flat for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  change in thousands land expense maintenance terminal overhead yard and gate warehouse total land expense non vessel related maintenance expenses decreased primarily due to lower maintenance expenses associated with the new refrigerated container equipment added to our fleet during and other new container equipment added to our fleet in this decrease is partially offset by an increase of million in fuel costs 
terminal overhead increased primarily due to higher utility expenses  labor related expenses and higher insurance costs 
yard and gate expense is comprised of the costs associated with moving cargo into and out of the terminal facility and the costs associated with the storage of equipment and revenue loads in the terminal facility 
yard and gate expenses decreased primarily due to decreased revenue container volumes  offset slightly by a million increase in fuel costs 
year ended december  year ended december  change in thousands depreciation and amortization depreciation owned vessels depreciation and amortization other amortization of intangible assets total depreciation and amortization amortization of vessel drydocking depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
depreciation of owned vessels increased by million due to the acquisition of the rights and beneficial interests of the sole owner participant in two separate trusts  the assets of which consist primarily of the horizon enterprise and the horizon pacific in the third quarter of fiscal year the million decrease in depreciation and amortization other is primarily due to a decrease in depreciation of leasehold improvements and containers 
the decrease in leasehold improvements is due to the write off of certain leasehold improvements made prior to the acquisition of the rights and beneficial interests in the aforementioned trusts in september amortization of vessel drydocking 
amortization of vessel drydocking decreased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease is primarily related to an increased number of drydockings in and and to lower overall costs on recent drydockings 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative costs decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
this decrease is comprised of an million decrease in stock based compensation expense  and million in management fees 
the management fee expenses related to the previous management services and related fee provisions of a management agreement with castle harlan 
such management agreement was terminated in conjunction with the company s initial public offering in september these decreases are offset by a million increase in professional fees  million increase in salaries and related expenses  and million increase in other expenses 
the professional fees increase is primarily due to consulting related professional fees  and an increase in audit and legal fees 
in addition  expenses associated with the secondary offerings and shelf registration totaling million are relatively flat with other transaction related costs of million during miscellaneous expense  net 
miscellaneous expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase is primarily a result of recognized losses on the retirement of equipment during and an increase in bad debt expense 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
this decrease is comprised of a million decrease attributable to the redemption of million of the principal amount of the senior notes and million principal amount of the senior discount notes utilizing proceeds from the company s initial public offering in september and a million increase in interest income related to higher cash balances and higher interest rates earned on the company s cash balances during compared to the decrease is offset by a million increase in interest expense under our senior credit facility due to a basis point increase in interest rates during as compared to and a million increase in interest expense related to the notes issued by the owner trustees for the purchase of the horizon enterprise and the horizon pacific 
loss on early extinguishment of debt 
loss on early extinguishment of debt was million for the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the loss on extinguishment is due to the write off of deferred finance fees associated with the million voluntary prepayment of our term loan 
the loss on extinguishment is primarily due to redemption premiums and the write off of deferred financing costs associated with the early retirement of a portion of our senior notes and senior discount notes that occurred during income tax expense 
income tax benefit expense was million in and million in  which represent effective tax rates of and  respectively 
during  after evaluating the merits and requirements of the tonnage tax  the company elected the application of the tonnage tax instead of the federal corporate income tax on income from its qualifying shipping activities 
this election of the tonnage tax was made in connection with the filing of the company s federal corporate income tax return and will also apply to all subsequent federal income tax returns unless the company revokes this alternative tonnage tax treatment 
the company does not intend to revoke its election of the tonnage tax in the foreseeable future 
the company is accounting for this election as a change in the tax status of its qualifying shipping activities 
the impact of this tonnage tax election resulted in a decrease in income tax expense of approximately million during the year ended december  approximately million and million relate to the reduction in income tax expense and revaluation of the deferred taxes related to the application of tonnage tax to qualifying activities  respectively 
excluding the reduction in income tax expense and revaluation of the deferred taxes related to qualifying activities  the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december  would be 
retroactively applying the tonnage tax to the year ended december  would result in a effective tax rate of 
the differences between the federal and state statutory tax rates and the overall effective tax rate for the year ended december  is related primarily to permanent differences resulting from stock based compensation

operating revenue increased to  million for the year ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million  or 
this revenue increase can be attributed to the following factors in thousands revenue container volume decrease more favorable cargo mix and general rate increases bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges included in rates to offset rising fuel costs management contract to manage seven oceanographic vessels for the us government and management contract to manage two ready reserve fleet vessels growth in other non transportation services total operating revenue increase the decreased revenue due to lower container volume for the year ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  is primarily a result of a week accounting year in compared to a week accounting year in and a strategic shift away from lower margin automobile cargo to more refrigerated cargo and other higher margin freight 
this decreased volume was mostly offset by strong market demand for transportation services in the markets we serve  particularly in the alaska market 
bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges  which are included in our transportation revenue  accounted for approximately of total revenue in the year ended december  and approximately of total revenue in the year ended december  we increased our bunker and intermodal fuel surcharges several times throughout as a result of significant increases in the cost of fuel for our vessels in addition to fuel increases passed on to us by our truck  rail  and barge carriers 
fuel surcharges are evaluated regularly as the price of fuel fluctuates and we may at times incorporate these surcharges into our base transportation rates that we charge 
the management contract to manage seven oceanographic vessels was awarded to us in the fourth quarter of the twelve month period ended december  and the management contract to manage two ready reserve fleet vessels was awarded to us in the third quarter of fiscal year the growth in other non transportation services includes increases in agency and terminal services provided to third parties  other ancillary services  and space charter revenue not included in transportation revenue 
operating expense 
operating expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in operating expense primarily reflects the effect of rising fuel prices  increases in labor and other inflationary costs  and additional costs associated with the growth in our non transportation and other revenue 
vessel expense  which is not primarily driven by revenue container volume  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
this million increase can be attributed to the following factors in thousands increased vessel fuel costs vessel operating costs from vessel management contracts reduction of vessel lease expense from vessel purchases vessel space purchases from other carriers labor and other vessel operating increases including operating the horizon fairbanks in alaska during summer months total vessel expense increase marine expense is comprised of the costs incurred to bring vessels into and out of port  and to load and unload containers 
the types of costs included in marine expense are stevedoring and benefits  pilotage fees  tug fees  government fees  wharfage fees  dockage fees  and line handler fees 
marine expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase can be attributed to contractual labor increases as expenses related to revenue container volumes were nearly flat from year to year 
inland expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase is a result of a higher percentage of inland moves versus port to port moves performed for our revenue containers shipped  and a substantial increase in fuel surcharges passed onto us by rail  truck  and barge carriers  in addition to normal contractual labor increases 
land expense is comprised of the costs included within the terminal for the handling  maintenance and storage of containers  including yard operations  gate operations  maintenance  warehouse and terminal overhead 
land expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the twelve months ended december   an increase of million or 
higher non vessel related maintenance expenses can primarily be attributed to higher fuel costs to power our refrigerated containers in addition to an increase in refrigerated cargo moves 
yard and gate expenses increased year over year due to additional grounding moves in our yards due to yard congestion and increased labor costs due to normal contractual rate increase

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a policy for managing risk related to exposure to variability in interest rates  fuel prices and other relevant market rates and prices which includes entering into derivative instruments in order to mitigate our risks 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates is limited to our senior credit facility and one of our operating leases 
the interest rate for our senior credit facility is currently indexed to libor of one  two  three  or six months as selected by us  or the alternate base rate as defined in the senior credit facility 
one of our operating leases is currently indexed to libor of one month 
predecessor a used interest rate protection agreements in the past to reduce borrowing rates although none are in effect as of december  in addition  we utilize derivative instruments tied to various indexes to hedge a portion of our quarterly exposure to bunker fuel price increases 
these instruments consist of fixed price swap agreements 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
credit risk related to the derivative financial instruments is considered minimal and is managed by requiring high credit standards for its counterparties 
changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments are recorded as adjustments to the assets or liabilities being hedged in the statement of operations or in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  depending on whether the derivative is designated and qualifies for hedge accounting  the type of hedge transaction represented and the effectiveness of the hedge 
as of december   we do not have any hedges in place 
the aggregate annual charter hire for the vessels under our agreements with sfl is based on certain assumptions with respect to final vessel price and interest rates that will be adjusted on the date of the delivery of the particular vessel 
the vessel owners have entered into forward starting swaps to lock in the interest rate on the underlying bank loan with fortis 
however  if the vessel delivery date or vessel cost changes  the forward starting swap agreements will need to be adjusted 
if the underlying interest rate on the bank loans to the vessel owners is changed due to any of the above reasons  the aggregate annual charter hire will also change
