we intend to acquire and  in the appropriate market conditions  develop additional hotels and provide structured financings to owners of lodging properties 
we may incur indebtedness to fund any such acquisitions  developments  or financings 
we may also incur indebtedness to meet distribution requirements imposed on reits under the internal revenue code to the extent that working capital and cash flow from our investments are insufficient to make the required distributions 
however  no assurances can be given that we will obtain additional financings or  if we do  what the amount and terms will be 
our failure to obtain future financing under favorable terms could adversely impact our ability to 
table of contents execute on our business strategy 
in addition  we may selectively pursue mortgage financing on individual properties and our mortgage investments 
we will acquire or develop additional hotels and invest in structured financings only as suitable opportunities arise  and we will not undertake such investments unless adequate sources of financing are available 
funds for future hotel related investments are expected to be derived  in whole or in part  from future borrowings under a credit facility or other borrowings or from the proceeds of additional issuances of common stock  preferred stock  or other securities 
however  other than the acquisitions discussed herein  we have no formal commitment or understanding to invest in additional assets  and there can be no assurance that we will successfully make additional investments 
our existing hotels are located in developed areas that contain competing hotel properties 
the future occupancy  adr  and revpar of any individual hotel could be materially and adversely affected by an increase in the number or quality of the competitive hotel properties in its market area 
competition could also affect the quality and quantity of future investment opportunities 
inflation we rely entirely on the performance of our properties and the ability of the properties managers to increase revenues to keep pace with inflation 
hotel operators can generally increase room rates rather quickly  but competitive pressures may limit their ability to raise rates faster than inflation 
our general and administrative costs  real estate and personal property taxes  property and casualty insurance  and utilities are subject to inflation as well 
seasonality our properties operations historically have been seasonal as certain properties maintain higher occupancy rates during the summer months 
this seasonality pattern can cause fluctuations in our quarterly lease revenue under our percentage leases 
we anticipate that our cash flows from the operations of our properties will be sufficient to enable us to make quarterly distributions to maintain our reit status 
to the extent that cash flows from operations are insufficient during any quarter due to temporary or seasonal fluctuations in lease revenue  we expect to utilize other cash on hand or borrowings to fund required distributions 
however  we cannot make any assurances that we will make distributions in the future 
critical accounting polcies our accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of the financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
the company believes that the following discussion addresses the company s most critical accounting policies  representing those policies considered most vital to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
use of estimates in connection with the company s acquisition of marriott crystal gateway hotel in arlington  virginia  on july   the company assumed the existing management agreement  which expires in with three ten year renewal options and provides for a base management fee of of the hotel s gross revenues plus certain incentive management fees 
based on the company s review of this management agreement  the company concluded that the terms are more favorable to the manager than a typical current market management agreement 
as a result  the company recorded an unfavorable contract liability of approximately million related to this management agreement as of the acquisition date based on the present value of expected cash outflows over the initial term of the agreement 
in addition  as of december   the company s deferred tax asset valuation allowance of approximately million includes approximately million related to this unfavorable management contract liability and approximately million related to monies received from the hotel manager upon acquisition of the jw marriott 
table of contents hotel in san francisco  california 
the analysis utilized by the company in determining its deferred tax asset valuation allowance involves considerable management judgment and assumptions 
investment in hotel properties the initial properties are stated at the predecessor s historical cost  net of any impairment charges  plus approximately million of minority interest partial step up recorded upon the company s formation related to the acquisition of minority interest from unaffiliated parties associated with four of the initial properties 
hotel properties acquired subsequent to the company s formation are stated at cost 
all improvements and additions which extend the useful life of hotel properties are capitalized 
impairment of investment in hotel properties hotel properties are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of such hotel properties may not be recoverable 
the company tests for impairment in several situations  including when current or projected cash flows are less than historical cash flows  when it becomes more likely than not that a hotel property will be sold before the end of its previously estimated useful life  and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a hotel property s net book value may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the impairment of hotel properties  the company makes many assumptions and estimates  including projected cash flows  holding period  expected useful life  future capital expenditures  and fair values  which considers capitalization rates  discount rates  and comparable selling prices 
if an asset was deemed to be impaired  the company would record an impairment charge for the amount that the property s net book value exceeds its fair value 
to date  no such impairment charges have been recognized 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation expense is based on the estimated useful life of the company s assets  while amortization expense for leasehold improvements is based on the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful life of the related assets 
presently  hotel properties are depreciated using the straight line method over lives which range from to years for buildings and improvements and to years for furniture  fixtures  and equipment 
while the company believes its estimates are reasonable  a change in estimated lives could affect depreciation expense and net income loss as well as the gain or loss on the potential sale of any of the company s hotels 
assets held for sale and discontinued operations the company records assets as held for sale when management has committed to a plan to sell the assets  actively seeks a buyer for the assets  and the consummation of the sale is considered probable and is expected within one year 
the related operations of assets held for sale are reported as discontinued if a such operations and cash flows can be clearly distinguished  both operationally and financially  from the ongoing operations of the company  b such operations and cash flows will be eliminated from ongoing operations once the disposal occurs  and c the company will not have any significant continuing involvement subsequent to the disposal 
notes receivable the company provides mezzanine and first mortgage financing in the form of loans 
loans receivable are recorded at cost  adjusted for net origination fees and costs 
premiums  discounts  and net origination fees are amortized or accreted as an adjustment to interest income using the effective interest method 
loans receivable are reviewed for potential impairment at each balance sheet date 
a loan receivable is considered impaired when it becomes probable  based on current information  that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms 
the amount of impairment  if any  is measured by comparing the recorded amount of the loan to the present value of the expected cash flows or the fair value of the collateral 
if a loan was deemed to be impaired  the company would record a reserve for loan losses through a charge to income for any shortfall 
to date  no such impairment charges have been recognized 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  as revised fin no 
 variable interest entities  as defined  are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiaries if the variable interest entities do not effectively disperse risks among parties involved 
the company s mezzanine and first mortgage loans receivable are each secured by various hotel properties or partnership interests in hotel properties and are subordinate to primary loans related to the secured hotels 
all of these loans receivable are considered to be variable interests in the entities that own the related hotels  which are variable interest entities 
however  the company is not considered to be the primary beneficiary of these hotel properties as a result of holding these loans 
therefore  the company does not consolidate such hotels for which it has provided financing 
interests in entities acquired or created in the future will be evaluated based on fin no 

table of contents criteria  and such entities will be consolidated  if required 
the analysis utilized by the company in evaluating fin no 
criteria involves considerable management judgment and assumptions

the acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions including  among other things  approval by a majority of cnl s outstanding common shareholders 
pursuant to this agreement  the company and a third party have jointly and severally guaranteed payment of certain performance obligations to cnl of up to approximately million 
to fund this acquisition  the company intends to use committed debt and equity financing with a financial institution as well as assumptions of the seller s existing debt 
the components of the committed debt include approximately billion of ten year  fixed rate debt at an estimated average blended interest rate of  approximately million of three year  variable rate debt with two one year extension options at an interest rate of libor plus  and approximately million of one year  variable rate debt with a two year extension option at an interest rate of libor plus

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure consists of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our debt instruments that bear interest at variable rates that fluctuate with market interest rates 
the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
as of december   our billion debt portfolio consisted of approximately million  or  of fixed rate debt  with interest rates ranging from to  and approximately million  or  of variable rate debt 
as of december   our million debt portfolio consisted of approximately million  or  of fixed rate debt  with interest rates ranging from to  and approximately million  or  of variable rate debt 
our overall weighted average interest rate at december  and was and  respectively 
periodically  we purchase derivatives to increase stability related to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps and caps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
interest rate caps provide us with interest rate protection above the strike rate on the cap and result in us receiving interest payments when interest rates exceed the cap strike 
as of december  and  we owned the following interest rate caps on october   we purchased a libor interest rate cap with a million notional amount  which matures october   to limit our exposure to rising interest rates on million of its variable rate debt 
we designated the million cap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to changes in interest rates on a corresponding amount of variable rate debt 
on december   we purchased a libor interest rate cap with a million notional amount  which matures december   to limit our exposure to rising interest rates on million of its variable rate 
table of contents debt 
we designated the million cap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to changes in interest rates on a corresponding amount of variable rate debt 
on december   we purchased a libor interest rate cap with a million notional amount  which matures december   to limit our exposure to rising interest rates on future variable rate debt that we intend to draw over the next two years as capital expenditures are incurred 
as this cap did not meet applicable hedge accounting criteria  it is not designated as a cash flow hedge 
as of december  and  derivatives with a fair value of approximately  and  respectively  were included in other assets 
for the years ended december  and  the impact to our results of operations of a one point change in interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable rate debt as of december  and  respectively  would be approximately million and million  respectively 
as of december   our million notes receivable portfolio consisted of approximately million of outstanding variable rate notes and approximately million of outstanding fixed rate notes 
as of december   our million notes receivable portfolio consisted of approximately million of outstanding variable rate notes and approximately million of outstanding fixed rate notes 
for the years ended december  and  the impact to our results of operations of a one point change in interest rate on the outstanding balance of variable rate notes receivable as of december  and  respectively  would be approximately  and  respectively 
the above amounts were determined based on the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing and lending portfolios  and assume no changes in our capital structure 
as the information presented above includes only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
hence  the information presented herein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on exposures that arise during the period  the hedging strategies at the time  and the related interest rates
