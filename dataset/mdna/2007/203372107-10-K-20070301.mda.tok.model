item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
on january  we acquired the connectivity solutions business of avaya 
historical financial and other information included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for periods prior to january  reflects the business of commscope prior to our acquisition of the connectivity solutions business  unless otherwise noted 
because the acquisition of the connectivity solutions business is significant to us  historical financial information for periods prior to the acquisition may not be indicative of our financial condition and performance for future periods 
overview commscope  inc is a world leader in infrastructure solutions for communications networks 
our highly engineered cable and connectivity solutions enable a host of information rich and interactive services that are delivered to the home  office and mobile devices 
we focus on the last mile in communications networks  which is the distribution access  or final link to the customer 
we are a global leader in structured cabling for business enterprise applications and in broadband coaxial cables for the cable television industry 
we are an industry leader in the design and manufacture of environmentally secure enclosures to integrate complex equipment for digital subscriber line dsl and fiber to the node fttn deployments by telecommunication service providers in the united states 
we also design  manufacture and market a broad line of high performance electronic  coaxial and fiber optic cable products for data networking  internet access  wireless communication  telephony and other broadband applications 
net sales for increased by million or to  million as compared to due to strong sales growth within each of our operating segments 
the strong sales growth was primarily attributable to price increases  increases in sales volumes of existing products and new product introductions 
the sales growth was realized both domestically as well as in most international regions 
operating income for increased to million from million in  primarily due to an increase in gross margin to during compared with during and a million reduction in restructuring costs incurred 
operating income for was favorably impacted by a million recovery of accounts receivable that had previously been written off 
net income increased to million for compared to reported for  reflecting the improved operating income results  an million gain realized during on a note receivable from ofs brightwave and a million pretax improvement in net interest income 
during the periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the primary source of revenue from our enterprise segment was sales of structured cabling solutions to large  multinational companies  primarily through a global network of distributors  system integrators and value added resellers 
the segment also includes coaxial cable for various video and data applications  other than cable television 
demand for enterprise segment products depends primarily on information technology spending by enterprises  such as communications projects in new buildings or campuses  building expansions or upgrades of network systems within buildings  campuses or data centers 
the primary source of revenue for our broadband segment was product sales to cable television system operators 
demand for our broadband segment products depends primarily on capital spending by cable television system operators for maintaining  constructing and rebuilding or upgrading their systems 
the primary source of revenue for our carrier segment was sales of secure environmental enclosures for electronic devices and equipment 
these products are used by wireline and wireless telecommunication service providers carriers and may be sold directly to the carriers or to original equipment manufacturers oems providing equipment to such carriers 
the carrier segment also derives revenue from the sale of cables and components used by wireless providers to connect antennae to transmitters 
demand for carrier segment products depends primarily on capital spending by carriers to expand their distribution networks or increase the capacity of their networks 
our future financial condition and performance will be largely dependent upon global spending by business enterprises on information technology  investment by telecommunication companies in the communications infrastructure  overall global business conditions  our ability to manage costs successfully among our global operations  and the other factors set forth in item a of this form k 
our profitability is also affected by the mix and volume of sales among our various product groups and between domestic and international customers and competitive pricing pressures 
we have experienced significant increases and greater volatility in raw material prices during the past several years as a result of increased global demand and supply disruptions 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of increases in raw material price volatility through effective requirements planning  working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms and implementing price increases 
delays in implementing price increases  failure to achieve market acceptance of future price increases  or price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs could have a material adverse impact on the results of our operations 
critical accounting policies this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes a discussion and analysis of our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates and their underlying assumptions form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other objective sources 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revises its estimates  as appropriate  when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
the following significant accounting estimates reflected in our financial statements are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events 
it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses expected to result from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimates are based on management s evaluation of the ability of our customers to make payments  focusing on customer financial difficulties and age of receivable balances 
an adverse change in financial condition of a significant customer or group of customers could materially affect management s future estimates related to doubtful accounts 
reserves for sales returns  discounts  allowances  rebates and distributor price protection programs we record estimated reductions to revenue for potential sales returns as well as customer programs and incentive offerings  such as discounts  allowances  rebates and distributor price protection programs 
these estimates are based on contract terms  historical experience  inventory levels in the distributor channel and other factors 
management believes it has sufficient historical experience to allow for reasonable and reliable estimation of these reductions to revenue 
however  declining market conditions could result in increased sales returns and allowances and potential distributor price protection incentives  resulting in future reductions to revenue 
inventory excess and obsolescence reserves we maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of cost or market principle  including allowances for excess and obsolete inventory 
these reserves are based on management s assumptions about and analysis of relevant factors including current levels of orders and backlog  shipment experience  forecasted demand and market conditions 
we do not believe our products are subject to a significant risk of obsolescence in the short term and management believes it has the ability to adjust production levels in response to declining demand 
however  if actual market conditions deteriorate from those anticipated by management  additional allowances for excess and obsolete inventory could be required 
product warranty reserves we recognize a liability for the estimated claims that may be paid under our customer warranty agreements to remedy potential deficiencies of quality or performance of our products 
the product warranties extend over periods ranging from one to twenty five years from the date of sale  depending upon the product subject to the warranty 
we record a provision for estimated future warranty claims based upon the historical relationship of warranty claims to sales and specifically identified warranty issues 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and revise our estimates  as appropriate  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
although these estimates are based on management s knowledge of and experience with past and current events and on management s assumptions about future events  it is reasonably possible that they may ultimately differ materially from actual results 
equity based compensation as of january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment  and therefore recognize the estimated fair value of stock options and other equity based instruments as an expense over the requisite service period 
we use the black scholes valuation method to estimate the fair value of options granted to employees or directors 
numerous assumptions are required to estimate the fair value of options granted and the expense to be recognized  including but not limited to stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  expected dividend rates  option exercise rates and forfeiture rates 
management believes that the valuation approach and assumptions utilized are reasonable 
use of a different valuation methodology or assumptions could produce a materially different result 
tax valuation allowances we establish an income tax valuation allowance when available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider the amounts and timing of expected future deductions or carryforwards and sources of taxable income that may enable utilization 
we maintain an existing valuation allowance until sufficient positive evidence exists to support its reversal 
changes in the amount or timing of expected future deductions or taxable income may have a material impact on the level of deferred tax valuation allowances 
if we determine that we will not be able to realize all or part of a deferred tax asset in the future  an increase to an income tax asset valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
we also establish allowances for value added and similar tax recoverables when it is considered probable that those assets are not collectible 
changes in the probability of recovery or in the estimates of the amount recoverable are recognized in the period such determination is made and may be material to earnings 
impairment reviews management reviews intangible assets  investments and other long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be fully recoverable 
goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually as of august and on an interim basis when events or circumstances change 
management assesses potential impairment of the carrying values of these assets based on market prices  if available  or assumptions about and estimates of future cash flows expected from these assets 
operating performance  market conditions and other factors may adversely impact estimates of expected future cash flows 
any impairment indicated by this analysis would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds fair value  estimated by management based on market prices  if available  or forecasted cash flows  discounted using a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
assumptions related to future cash flows and discount rates involve management judgment and are subject to significant uncertainty 
if assumptions used in the assessment and measurement of impairment differ from management s prior estimates and forecasts  additional impairment charges could be required 
pension and postretirement benefits our pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities are developed from actuarial valuations 
critical assumptions inherent in these valuations include the discount rate  health care cost trend rate  rate of return on plan assets and mortality rates 
assumptions are subject to change each year based on changes in market conditions and in management s assumptions about future events 
changes in these assumptions may have a material impact on future pension and postretirement benefit costs and liabilities 
comparison of results of operations for the year ended december  with the year ended december  amount of net sales amount of net sales dollar change change dollars in millions  except per share amounts net sales gross profit sg a expense r d expense restructuring costs net gain on ofs brightwave note receivable  net of tax net income net income per diluted share net sales consolidated net sales increased during primarily due to higher prices for enterprise and broadband segment products in response to higher raw material costs  increased domestic sales of ics products and sales growth in the enterprise and broadband segments 
for further details by segment  see the section titled segment results below 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit for increased by million to million and gross profit margin increased to compared to for these improvements reflect the impact of price increases implemented in response to increases in raw material costs  changes in the mix of products sold  increased sales volume and cost reductions  including those resulting from the global manufacturing initiatives begun during the third quarter of see restructuring costs below 
increased prices and greater volatility in the cost of raw materials  such as copper  aluminum  steel and plastics and other polymers increased cost of sales 
as a result of these higher costs  we implemented price increases for certain products during and  which substantially offset the impact of higher raw material prices on gross margin 
we expect gross profit and gross profit margin to improve in  largely as a result of higher sales volume and additional cost savings from the global manufacturing initiatives 
however  changes in pricing in response to volatility in raw material costs may reduce gross profit and gross profit margin if we delay implementing price increases  are unable to achieve market acceptance of future price increases or implement price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material prices 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million to million during and decreased modestly as a percentage of net sales to during compared to during the increase in sg a is largely attributable to higher selling expenses directly related to the increase in sales and somewhat attributable to a million benefit recognized in related to recovery of accounts receivable from adelphia that had been written off in see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional discussion of this recovery 
also contributing to the increase in sg a were million of equity based compensation expense recognized as a result of implementing sfas no 
r  share based payment  during and million of costs incurred in connection with the proposed acquisition of andrew corporation 
excluding the impact of the adelphia recovery  sg a as a percentage of net sales was for the reduction in sg a as a percentage of sales from this adjusted percentage reflects the impact of increased sales prices and higher sales volumes in as well as the benefit from cost reduction initiatives 
research and development r d expense increased by million to million during primarily related to developing new products and modifying existing products to better serve our customers 
r d expenses are primarily incurred in the enterprise and carrier segments 
restructuring costs we recognized million of pretax restructuring charges during  compared to million recognized during the charges relate to the global manufacturing initiatives adopted in august and the charges included million related to the global manufacturing initiatives and million related to completing the organizational and cost reduction initiatives begun in at csmi  the company s wholly owned subsidiary 
the objectives of the global manufacturing initiatives are to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to enhance the company s long term competitive position 
implementation of these initiatives includes shifting significant enterprise and broadband segment cable production capacity among our global facilities  consolidating operations at the csmi omaha facility into one building and closing a broadband segment manufacturing facility in scottsboro  alabama in late charges incurred during for the global manufacturing initiatives included million for employee related costs and million for equipment relocation costs  partially offset by a million net asset impairment gain primarily related to the sale of previously impaired assets 
the employee related costs include accruals for severance and related fringe benefits and are accrued ratably over the period employees are obligated to provide services in order to receive benefits 
additional pretax employee related charges of up to million are expected to be recognized in to complete the global manufacturing initiatives 
equipment relocation costs relate directly to shifting manufacturing capacity among our global manufacturing facilities and include costs to uninstall  pack  ship and re install equipment as well as the costs to prepare the receiving facility to accommodate the equipment 
these costs are recognized as the expenses are incurred and additional costs of approximately million are expected to be recognized in to complete the global manufacturing initiatives 
the net asset impairment gain recognized during reflects primarily a gain of million from the sale of production equipment that had been impaired during and an impairment charge of million relating to land at the omaha facility that is being marketed for sale and for certain assets from the scottsboro  alabama facility that were abandoned 
charges incurred during related to the global manufacturing initiatives included million for employee related costs including million of curtailment and special termination benefits relating from an early retirement offer  million for equipment relocation costs and million for asset impairment charges 
the asset impairment charges related to production equipment that was identified as excess  pending consolidation of certain production operations in other facilities 
as a result of restructuring actions  there is significant unutilized space in our omaha facility as well as the unutilized scottsboro  alabama facility 
we are currently attempting to sell all of this unutilized space 
as of december   assets with a net book value of million  which are classified as property  plant and equipment  are being marketed for sale 
additional charges  which are not expected to be material  may be incurred in completing this process 
net interest income expense net interest income during was million  compared to net interest expense of million during this improvement is primarily due to higher interest income from the significantly higher balances of invested cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  the average interest rate on outstanding borrowing was essentially unchanged due to the reduction in the balance of our senior term note due to principal payments  offset by increases in the rate on the note due to increases in short term interest rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for excluding the impact of the gain on the ofs brightwave note receivable  compared to for our effective tax rate reflects the benefits derived from significant operations outside the us  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 
the modestly higher effective tax rate for reflects changes in the mix of our taxable earnings between domestic and foreign operations and the impact of not recognizing tax benefits of operating losses in certain of our foreign operations 
our tax provision included the establishment of a million valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets arising from net operating losses from one of our foreign subsidiaries and million related to establishing tax reserves for various prior year state income tax matters arising from tax audits  which were substantially offset by the release of million of previously established valuation allowances related to state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
ofs brightwave  llc in june  the company agreed to accept and received million plus accrued interest in full satisfaction of the amount owed by ofs brightwave under a million note receivable 
the note had originally been entered into in in conjunction with the company s initial acquisition of an equity interest in ofs brightwave 
the carrying value of the note receivable had been written down to zero through recording commscope s equity in ofs brightwave losses and as a result of the transaction in which the company s interest in ofs brightwave was reduced to zero 
the repayment of the note receivable resulted in a million pretax gain million after tax or per diluted share 
segment results of net of net dollar amount sales amount sales change change dollars in millions net sales by segment enterprise broadband carrier inter segment eliminations consolidated net sales total domestic sales total international sales total worldwide sales operating income by segment enterprise broadband carrier consolidated operating income enterprise segment the increase in net sales of enterprise segment products was primarily due to higher prices  increased sales volumes of existing products  changes in product mix and sales of new products 
the higher prices were implemented in response to significant increases in the cost of raw materials  particularly metals  plastics and other polymers 
sales volumes increased in every region  with particular strength in north america  central and latin america and europe middle east africa 
we anticipate that sales volumes will continue to increase during as business enterprises continue to invest in higher capacity infrastructure solutions to support the demand for greater bandwidth 
the increase in operating income is attributable in large part to lower restructuring costs in million in compared to million in as the global manufacturing initiatives were substantially concluded  higher sales volume and selling prices  shifts in the mix of products sold towards products with higher profit margins and the impact of cost reduction efforts  including those realized from the global manufacturing initiatives 
broadband segment the increase in net sales of broadband segment products was primarily due to higher prices  the increased sales volumes of existing products and the sales from the mc product line that was acquired in march the higher prices were implemented in response to significant increases in the cost of raw materials  particularly metals  plastics and other polymers 
sales volumes increased in all regions with particular strength in north america  central and latin america and europe middle east africa 
domestic sales increases generally result from continued infrastructure needs of our large cable television system operators and international increases generally result from new projects and ongoing system maintenance 
we anticipate modest sales growth during as domestic cable television system operators continue to maintain their networks  expand product offerings and compete with telephone companies for residential and commercial customers 
the million decrease in operating income was due primarily to the million benefit recognized in related to the recovery of the accounts receivable from adelphia that had been written off in operating income in was favorably impacted by higher sales volumes and savings realized from the global manufacturing initiatives and negatively impacted by a provision of million included in cost of goods sold related to the portion of value added taxes receivable at our brazilian subsidiary that are not believed to be recoverable and by higher restructuring costs in compared to million in as the global manufacturing initiatives were largely implemented during carrier segment the increase in net sales of carrier segment products was due to significantly higher sales volume of integrated cabinet solutions ics products 
the rapid growth of the ics business reflects the demand from dsl and fttn deployments by telephone companies to support video and high speed data services 
net sales of wireless products was essentially unchanged between years and net sales of exchangemax products decreased modestly as a result of our decision during to exit the twisted pair central office cable products business 
we expect continued sales growth of our ics products as telephone companies continue to deploy dsl and other services in order to compete with cable companies and other telecommunication service providers 
operating income improved by million largely as a result of the higher sales volume of ics products and the benefit of cost reduction efforts  including the global manufacturing initiatives 
operating income was also favorably impacted by lower restructuring costs million in compared to million in 
outlook we are encouraged by the global outlook for our products 
we believe market conditions for the enterprise and broadband segments should support revenue growth in from increases in global sales volume 
pricing actions in response to volatility in the cost of raw materials such as copper  aluminum and plastics could have a significant impact on our sales 
carrier segment sales are expected to continue to grow as certain wireline and wireless operators upgrade their communications networks 
we are dependent upon continued spending for maintenance of existing infrastructure and ongoing capital investment by our customers in each segment in order to achieve an increase in sales 
we expect operating income to increase during  primarily due to higher sales volumes  shifts of the mix of products sold to higher margin products and realizing the benefits of cost reduction initiatives implemented during volatile raw materials costs continue to pose a risk to achieving operating margin targets

accordingly  the consolidated results for the year ended december  include the operating results of connectivity solutions for the eleven month period from february  through december  this information should be considered when comparing the financial results of and see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
net sales overall  consolidated net sales increased during primarily due to strong growth in domestic ics and wireless product sales within the carrier segment and higher prices in response to higher raw material costs and modest sales growth in the enterprise and broadband segments 
for further details by segment  see the section titled segment results below 
gross profit net sales less cost of sales gross profit for increased by million to million and gross profit margin increased to compared to for these improvements reflect the impact of price increases implemented in response to increases in raw material costs  changes in the mix of products sold and cost reductions  including those resulting from the initiatives begun during the fourth quarter of at the csmi omaha facility 
gross profit margin for was adversely affected by the impact of purchase accounting adjustments on the connectivity solutions inventory 
these purchase accounting adjustments resulted from the write up of connectivity solutions finished goods and work in process inventory to reflect its acquired fair value as of the acquisition date 
this write up to fair value resulted in an increase of approximately million in cost of sales and lower margins following the connectivity solutions acquisition as the acquired inventory was sold 
the rising cost of raw materials  such as copper  aluminum  plastics and other polymers  and steel increased cost of sales 
as a result of these higher costs  we implemented price increases for certain products during and  which somewhat offset the impact of higher raw material prices on gross margin 
selling  general and administrative expense selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased by million to million during and decreased as a percentage of net sales to during compared to during the increase in sg a is net of a million benefit related to recovery of accounts receivable from adelphia that had been written off in see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional discussion of this recovery 
excluding the impact of the adelphia recovery  sg a as a percentage of net sales was for this adjusted percentage is lower than that for reflecting the impact of cost reduction initiatives and the absence of various costs incurred in associated with the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
research and development r d expense increased by million to million during primarily related to developing new enterprise segment structured cabling solutions  cost effective designs for products within each of our segments and production modifications for certain enterprise and broadband segment products in order to be in a position to comply with new regulations governing the use of certain hazardous substances in the manufacture of electronic equipment and components 
in process research and development charges we recognized a million pretax charge in for the write off of in process r d acquired in our acquisition of connectivity solutions 
this r d was valued as an intangible asset by independent appraisal in accordance with purchase accounting guidance 
since r d activities are required to be expensed as incurred under us generally accepted accounting principles  this acquired intangible asset was written off immediately following the acquisition date 
acquisition related transition and startup costs we incurred pretax charges of million during as a result of startup  transition and other costs related to the acquisition of connectivity solutions 
these charges primarily related to information technology  transition activities and other acquisition related costs 
we reduced the connectivity solutions workforce by approximately employees  or of the global workforce  during the first quarter of the reductions were primarily related to our efforts to improve operational efficiency and reduce cost and primarily affected the enterprise segment 
we recorded net pretax charges of million in acquisition related transition and startup costs for employee termination benefits related to this workforce reduction 
restructuring costs we recognized million of pretax restructuring charges during  compared to million recognized during the charges included million related to global manufacturing initiatives adopted by the board of directors in august and million related to completing the organizational and cost reduction initiatives begun in at csmi 
the objectives of the global manufacturing initiatives are to reduce costs by improving manufacturing efficiency and to enhance the company s long term competitive position 
implementation of these initiatives includes shifting significant enterprise and broadband segment cable production capacity among our global facilities  consolidating operations at the csmi omaha facility into one building and closing a broadband segment manufacturing facility in scottsboro  alabama in late charges incurred during for the global manufacturing initiatives included million for employee related costs  million for equipment relocation costs and million for asset impairment charges 
the employee related costs include accruals for severance and related fringe benefits of million and million related to pension and other postemployment benefit curtailment and special termination benefit costs resulting from an early retirement offer made available to and accepted by certain employees 
severance and related fringe benefits are accrued ratably over the period employees are obligated to provide services in order to receive benefits 
equipment relocation costs relate directly to shifting manufacturing capacity among our global manufacturing facilities and include costs to uninstall  pack  ship and re install equipment as well as the costs to prepare the receiving facility to accommodate the equipment 
these costs are recognized as the expenses are incurred 
asset impairment charges relate to production equipment that has been identified as excess  pending consolidation of certain production operations in other facilities 
it is anticipated that this equipment will be available for sale once the facility consolidation is complete 
the equipment has been recorded at its estimated net realizable value upon sale plus an estimate of its remaining utility while in service 
charges incurred during related to the organizational and cost reduction initiatives included million for process improvement costs  primarily consulting and other costs associated with modifying the manufacturing operations  and million for asset impairment charges related to equipment that was no longer in use  including million related to classifying a distribution facility as held for sale and reducing the carrying value to its estimated fair value less costs to sell 
there was a million reversal of reserves for severance and related fringe benefits established in as a result of there being fewer reductions in personnel  due to higher than anticipated levels of business for certain products 
loss on early extinguishment of debt we recognized a million pretax loss during on the early extinguishment of our convertible subordinated notes 
this loss includes premiums paid and accrued to note holders of million and the write off of the remaining balance of related long term financing costs of million 
net interest expense net interest expense during was million  compared to million during our weighted average effective interest rate on outstanding borrowings  including amortization of associated loan fees  was as of december   compared to as of december  the average interest rate on outstanding borrowing was essentially unchanged due to the reduction in the balance of our senior term note due to scheduled principal payments  offset by increases in the rate on the note due to increases in short term interest rates 
the reduction in net interest expense was primarily the result of increased interest income due to the larger invested balances in and higher short term interest rates 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for  compared to for our effective tax rate reflects the benefits derived from significant operations outside the us  which are generally taxed at rates lower than the us statutory rate of 
our tax provision includes the establishment of a million valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets arising from net operating losses from one of our foreign subsidiaries and million related to establishing tax reserves for various prior year state income tax matters arising from tax audits  which are substantially offset by the release of million of previously established valuation allowances related to state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
ofs brightwave  llc effective april   furukawa made additional equity investments in ofs brightwave and we elected not to make further corresponding investments in ofs brightwave 
as a result  our ownership percentage was reduced from to 
primarily as a result of the continuing weakness in the fiber optic cable market and furukawa s continuing efforts to restructure its ofs operations  we agreed with furukawa to further amend our existing contractual arrangements in the second quarter of for the mutual benefit of both companies 
on june   we agreed with furukawa to change the period in which we could exercise our contractual right to sell our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa from to any time on or after june  and changed the exercise price from million in cash to the approximately million shares of our common stock owned by furukawa 
on june   we exercised our contractual right to sell our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa in exchange for the approximately million shares of our common stock owned by furukawa  which had a fair value of million as of the transaction date 
we currently hold these shares as treasury stock 
as a result of this transaction  we no longer own any equity interest in ofs brightwave 
however  we maintained our strategic relationship with furukawa by entering into a four year optical fiber supply agreement with ofs fitel  llc fitel  a wholly owned subsidiary of furukawa  replacing the existing supply agreement with fitel that was scheduled to expire in november through this supply agreement  we continue to have access to a broad array of technologically advanced optical fibers 
we also have a cross license arrangement with a subsidiary of furukawa for key intellectual property 
the ofs brightwave transaction resulted in a net pretax gain of million million net of tax or per diluted share during this gain represents the fair value of the common stock received by us in exchange for the transfer of our ownership interest in ofs brightwave to furukawa  plus the realized gain from our cumulative equity method share of ofs brightwave s unrealized foreign currency translation gains previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss  less an million impairment charge related to fully impairing a million note receivable from ofs brightwave 
this transaction did not affect our right to receive full payment from ofs brightwave under the million note due in november  based on its original terms 
we continued to receive quarterly interest payments in accordance with the terms of the note while it was outstanding 
our share of the losses of ofs brightwave for the period from january  through june  was million  pretax 
we realized a tax benefit related to our share of the losses of million in segment results below is a summary that reflects our actual net sales by segment for the years ended december  and the net sales for the year ended december  incorporate the connectivity solutions net sales for the eleven month period from february  through december  of net of net dollar amount sales amount sales change change dollars in millions net sales by segment enterprise broadband carrier inter segment eliminations consolidated net sales total domestic sales total international sales total worldwide sales operating income loss by segment enterprise broadband carrier consolidated operating income enterprise segment the increase in net sales of enterprise segment products was primarily driven by improved international project business and the positive impact of price increases for certain products 
we announced price increases for certain enterprise segment products during as a result of significant increases in the cost of certain raw materials and further increased prices in in response to continued raw material cost increases 
in addition  the launch of our uniprise brand contributed to the increase in net sales 
domestic net sales volume of enterprise segment products in was modestly lower than  reflecting some limited customer acceptance of price increases 
during  systimax sales volume was negatively impacted by an effort to reduce external inventory balances held by distributors to a more appropriate level 
had we acquired connectivity solutions on january   net sales in the enterprise segment for would have been million higher than reported in the table above 
the increase in operating income reflects the improvement in gross margin  which resulted from price increases  changes in the mix of products sold and cost reductions 
the gross margin improvement was also impacted by the purchase accounting adjustments recorded in to write up the acquired connectivity solutions inventory to the estimated fair value as of the acquisition date 
the write up had the effect of lowering gross margin and operating income in as the acquired inventory was sold 
operating income in was also impacted by million of acquisition related transition and startup costs and million of in process research and development charges that were written off in accordance with purchase accounting rules 
operating income in was adversely impacted by higher restructuring costs than million in compared to million in 
these higher costs in were primarily related to the global manufacturing initiatives begun during see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
broadband segment the increase in net sales of broadband segment products for primarily resulted from the positive impact of price increases for certain products 
sales were also positively affected by expansion of international cable networks and the rebuilding of infrastructure damaged by the gulf coast hurricanes in the united states 
the increase in operating income is largely attributable to the million benefit recognized in related to recovery of accounts receivable from adelphia that had been written off in see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for additional discussion of this recovery 
the balance of the increase in operating income is due to price increases and changes in the mix of products sold 
carrier segment the ics product line generated the largest portion of the increase in carrier segment net sales for ics sales increased substantially due to sales to wireline carriers for dsl and fttn applications in the united states 
sales of cell reach wireless products during nearly doubled from the improvement in general financial conditions of our customers and competition to provide increased network capacity and capabilities has led to increased spending by the major wireless carriers 
in addition  we have developed relationships with certain new customers  who generally purchase larger diameter products  which have comparatively higher prices 
sales of exchangemax products decreased in due largely to weak demand for central office telecommunications equipment 
we have decided to exit the exchangemax twisted pair central office cable business which had net sales of approximately million during we are retaining the exchangemax apparatus business 
had we acquired connectivity solutions on january   net sales in the carrier segment for would have been million higher than reported in the table above 
the improvement in operating income was primarily attributable to the significant increase in sales and benefits realized from cost reduction efforts begun during also contributing to the improvement was the impact of lower restructuring costs million during compared to million during and million of acquisition related transition and startup costs incurred during liquidity and capital resources cash flow overview our principal sources of liquidity  both on a short term and long term basis  are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  cash flows provided by operations and availability under credit facilities 
reduced sales and profitability could reduce cash provided by operations and limit availability under credit facilities 
in addition  increases in working capital  excluding cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  related to increasing sales could reduce our operating cash flows in the short term until cash collections of accounts receivable catch up to the higher level of billings 
dollar change change cash  cash equivalents and short term investments net cash provided by operating activities working capital excluding cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and current portion of long term debt capital expenditures long term debt  including current portion book capital structure long term debt as a percentage of book capital structure the increase in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  was primarily the result of cash flow from operations 
the increase also reflects proceeds from the exercise of stock options and repayment of the ofs brightwave note receivable  offset by net capital expenditures  the acquisition of the mc product line and principal repayments on our long term debt 
the increase in working capital excluding cash  cash equivalents and short term investments was primarily driven by an increase in accounts receivable attributable to higher sales volumes and higher inventory balances resulting from higher sales volumes and increased raw materials costs 
our long term debt as a percent of book capital structure decreased during primarily due to the increase in book capital from net earnings and issuance of common stock as a result of stock option exercises and the decrease in long term debt of million as a result of principal repayments 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased year over year primarily due to higher operating income  which was somewhat offset by the increase in accounts receivable resulting from higher sales volumes and higher inventory levels due to increased raw material costs 
we expect to generate increased net cash from operations during primarily due to improved margins from sales of certain product groups and the impact of our cost reduction efforts 
investing activities our investment in property  plant and equipment was higher during primarily due to capital spending related to cost reduction efforts and additional production capability in asia  including completing the expansion of our manufacturing facility in suzhou  china 
we realized net cash proceeds of million from the sale of a building and land in omaha that was no longer being utilized 
as of december   we have land and buildings with a net carrying value of million that are no longer being utilized that we are attempting to sell 
we expect total capital expenditures during to remain at a level below consolidated depreciation and amortization expense 
financing activities as of december  the balance outstanding under the term loan portion of our senior secured credit facility was million and is required to be repaid by us in consecutive quarterly installments of million with a final payment of all outstanding principal and interest on december  we had availability under the revolving credit portion of the facility of million and had no outstanding borrowings under this facility as of december  our ability to borrow under this revolving credit facility depends on the amount of our borrowing base  which is determined as specified percentages of our eligible receivables and inventory  reduced for certain reserves and the total amount of letters of credit issued under the credit facility 
we believe we were in compliance with all of our covenants under this senior secured credit facility as of december  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for additional discussion of the terms of this senior secured credit facility 
on june   we filed a shelf registration statement for the issuance of common or preferred stock  senior or subordinated debt  convertible debt securities  warrants exercisable for any of the foregoing  or any combination thereof 
this registration statement was automatically effective upon filing  pursuant to sec rules  and no securities have been issued under this registration statement 
future cash needs we expect that our primary future cash needs will be to fund working capital  capital expenditures  debt service and employee benefit obligations 
we currently do not anticipate making any voluntary contributions to our defined benefit pension plans during funding requirements for these employee benefit liabilities are expected to be met with cash flows from future operations and new funding requirements under the pension protection act of are not expected to have a significant impact on our liquidity or cash flow from operations 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and cash flows from operations  combined with availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our presently anticipated future cash needs 
we may  from time to time  borrow under our revolving credit facility or issue securities  if market conditions are favorable  to meet our future cash needs or to reduce our borrowing costs 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  in millions amount of payments due per period contractual obligations total payments due less than year years years after years long term debt  including current maturities a interest on long term debt a b operating leases purchase obligations c pension and postretirement benefit liabilities d foreign currency derivative e total contractual obligations a no prepayment  redemption or conversion of any of our long term debt balances has been assumed 
refer to note to the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for information regarding the terms of our long term debt agreements 
b interest on variable rate debt is estimated based upon rates in effect as of december  c purchase obligations include minimum amounts owed under take or pay or requirements contracts

d amounts reflect expected payments under the postretirement benefit plans through see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
as there is no contractual obligation to make pension contributions  no amounts have been reflected above 
e estimated payments are based on exchange rates in effect as of december  effects of inflation and changing prices we continually attempt to minimize any effect of inflation on earnings by controlling our operating costs and selling prices 
the principal raw materials purchased by us copper  fabricated aluminum  steel  plastics and other polymers  bimetals and optical fiber are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets 
prices for copper  fluoropolymers and certain other polymers derived from oil and natural gas have increased substantially and become highly volatile over the last several years 
as a result  we have significantly increased our prices for certain products and may have to increase prices again in the future 
to the extent that we are unable to pass on cost increases to customers without a significant decrease in sales volume or must implement price reductions in response to a rapid decline in raw material costs  these cost changes could have a material impact on the results of our operations 
other we are either a plaintiff or a defendant in pending legal matters in the normal course of business  however  we believe none of these legal matters will have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations upon final disposition 
in addition  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations governing the use  discharge  disposal and remediation of hazardous materials 
compliance with current laws and regulations has not had  and is not expected to have  a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
newly issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation establishes a two step approach for the recognition and measurement of tax benefits arising from uncertainties about whether a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return will ultimately be sustained 
only those positions that are considered more likely than not to be sustained  based on their technical merits  may be recognized 
the amount recognized is the largest tax benefit that is at least likely to be realized 
we are required to apply the provisions of the interpretation as of january  and recognize the initial impact as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we have not determined the impact of adopting the interpretation 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
sfas no 
requires that the underfunded or overfunded position of defined benefit plans be fully recognized as a liability or asset on the balance sheet of the sponsor 
sfas no 
does not change how the expense related to such plans is determined 
our accrued benefit liability was adjusted as of december  to fully recognize the underfunded portion of our plans as a result of implementing sfas no 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
the provisions of sfas no 
requiring that plan assets and obligations be measured as of the year end balance sheet date are not required to be adopted until december   though earlier adoption is permitted 
we do not expect that there will be a material impact on results of operations or financial position from applying the provisions to be adopted by item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have established a risk management strategy that includes the reasonable use of derivative and non derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks resulting from adverse fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
derivative financial instruments that may be used by us include commodity pricing contracts  foreign currency exchange contracts and contracts hedging exposure to interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes  nor do we engage in speculation 
materials  in their finished form  account for a large portion of our cost of sales 
these materials  such as copper  fabricated aluminum  steel  plastics and other polymers  bimetals and optical fiber  are subject to changes in market price as they are influenced by commodity markets 
management attempts to mitigate these risks through effective requirements planning and by working closely with key suppliers to obtain the best possible pricing and delivery terms 
however  increases in the prices of certain commodity products have resulted in  and may continue to result in  higher overall production costs 
approximately and of our and net sales  respectively  were to customers located outside the us although we primarily bill customers in foreign countries in us dollars  a portion of our sales are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  particularly sales from some of our foreign subsidiaries 
significant changes in foreign currency exchange rates could adversely affect our international sales levels and the related collection of amounts due 
in addition  a significant decline in the value of currencies used in certain regions of the world as compared to the us dollar could adversely affect product sales in those regions because our products may become more expensive for those customers to pay for in their local currency 
at december   we were continuing to evaluate alternatives to help us reasonably manage the market risk related to foreign currency exposures 
in addition  we evaluated our commodity pricing exposures and concluded that it was not currently practical to use derivative financial instruments to hedge our current commodity price risks 
as of december   the only derivative financial instrument outstanding was a cross currency rate and forward foreign exchange swap agreement  which hedges a portion of our net investment in our belgian subsidiary and a portion of our other euro denominated asset exposure 
settlement of the fair value of this hedging instrument as of december  and would have resulted in a loss of approximately million and million  respectively  net of tax 
the portion of these unrealized losses that relates to the hedge of our belgian subsidiary is included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss while the remainder of the unrealized loss is recognized in earnings 
our non derivative financial instruments consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  trade receivables  trade payables and debt instruments 
at december  and  the carrying values of each of the financial instruments recorded on our balance sheet were considered representative of their respective fair values due to their variable interest rates and or short terms to maturity  with the exception of our convertible debentures  which were recorded in the financial statements at million and had a fair value of million at december  fair value of our debt is estimated using discounted cash flow analysis  based on our current incremental borrowing rates for similar types of arrangements  or quoted market prices whenever available 
the following tables summarize our market risks associated with long term debt and foreign currency exposure as of december  and the tables present principal  interest and net settlement cash outflows and related interest rates by year of maturity 
variable interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates for each year represent the rate effective for the related loan or derivative instrument as of the date of the table 
the tables assume payments will be made in accordance with due dates in the respective agreements and no prepayment of any amounts due 
the tabular format used below does not reflect our option to redeem all or a portion of our million aggregate principal amount of convertible debentures at any time on or after march  at of the principal amount plus accrued interest  the holders option to require us to repurchase all or a portion of the debentures on march   march  and march  for of the principal amount plus accrued interest  or the holders right to convert the debenture into shares of our common stock if certain conditions are met see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k
