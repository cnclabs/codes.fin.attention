in assessing forward looking statements contained herein  readers are urged to read carefully all risk factors and cautionary statements contained in this annual report 
further  the company operates in an industry sector where securities values are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond the company s control 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel small molecule therapeutics to treat cancer and certain eye diseases 
our focus is the development and commercialization of drug candidates that selectively disrupt abnormal blood vessels associated with solid tumor progression and visual impairment 
currently  we have two therapeutic product candidates in clinical and preclinical development 
our lead clinical compound is cap  which is in multiple ongoing clinical trials in various oncology and ophthalmic indications 
currently  we do not have any products available for sale 
the only source of potential revenue at this time is from the license to a third party of our formerly owned nicoplex and thiol test technology 
revenue in connection with this license arrangement is earned based on sales of products or services utilizing this technology 
revenue from this license agreement is recognized when payments are received due to the uncertainty of the timing of sales of products or services 
future revenues  if any  from this license agreement are expected to be minimal 
we do not expect to generate material revenue or fee income in the near future unless we enter into a major licensing arrangement 
our development programs and product candidates our primary drug development programs are based on a series of natural products called combretastatins  which were originally isolated from the african bush willow tree combretum caffrum by researchers at arizona state university  or asu 
asu has granted us an exclusive  worldwide  royalty bearing license with respect to the commercial rights to particular combretastatins 
through in vitro and in vivo testing  it has been established that certain combretastatins selectively disrupt the function of newly formed abnormal blood vessels associated with solid cancers and have a similar effect on abnormal blood vessels associated with certain diseases of the eye 
we have developed two distinct technologies that are based on combretastatins 
we refer to the first technology as vascular disrupting agents  or vdas 
we are currently developing vdas for indications in both oncology and ophthalmology 
we refer to the second technology as ortho quinone prodrugs  or oqps 
we are currently developing oqps for indications in oncology 
our preclinical studies have shown that vdas rapidly reduce blood flow within tumors  thereby causing rapid and extensive tumor cell death 
moreover  because vdas affect the central regions of the tumor  they may have the potential to enhance the effectiveness of currently available cancer therapies 
our most advanced vda is cap  which is being evaluated in multiple ongoing clinical trials in both oncology and ophthalmology  both as a single agent and in combination with other therapies  including chemotherapy  radiotherapy  antibody therapy and anti vegf therapy 
six clinical trials evaluating cap for the treatment of advanced solid tumor cancers have been completed 
more than patients have been dosed with cap  either as a monotherapy or in combination with other cancer fighting treatments in the clinical trials to date  including patients in our completed clinical trials 
currently  cap is being studied in ten clinical trials in oncology that are open or will soon be open for patient enrollment and one clinical trial in ophthalmology 

table of contents oqps exhibit not only the vascular disrupting properties characteristic of our lead vascular targeting agent cap  but may also kill tumor cells directly 
preclinical research with oxi  our first oqp candidate  suggests that it not only shuts down blood flow  but can then be metabolized into a compound which kills the remaining tumor cells at the periphery of the tumor 
currently  we have an ongoing phase i clinical trial of oxi in patients with advanced cancer 
we are committed to a disciplined financial strategy and as such maintain a limited employee and facilities base  with development  scientific  finance and administrative functions  which include  among other things  product development  regulatory oversight and clinical testing  managed from our waltham  massachusetts headquarters 
our research and development team members typically work on a number of development projects concurrently 
accordingly  we do not separately track the costs for each of these research and development projects to enable separate disclosure of these costs on a project by project basis 
we conduct substantial scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities 
regulatory and clinical testing functions are generally contracted out to third party  specialty organizations 
in fiscal  we expect to initiate several additional studies with our two main potential product candidates  cap and oxi in our two main focus areas  oncology and ophthalmology 
these additional studies will require significantly larger financial expenditures than we have incurred over the last several years as they are planned to be larger in scope due to higher numbers of patients anticipated to be enrolled and sites at which the potential product candidate will be evaluated 
our future financial requirements include resources for hiring of staff to manage the broader scope of these later stage trials  and for covering increased costs for specialty clinical management organizations  higher quantities of clinical study materials  additional pre clinical support costs and higher general and administrative support costs 
financial resources we have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately  for the period from our inception through december  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years  principally as a result of our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures 
the principal source of our working capital has been the proceeds of private and public equity financing and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options 
we currently have no material amount of licensing or other fee income 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we primarily invest in commercial paper  money market funds  investment grade corporate bonds  us government agency and debt securities  asset backed securities and certificates of deposit 
our investment objectives are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
as of december   the weighted average days to maturity of our available for sale marketable securities was approximately days  and the yield to maturity based on the cost of those investments was approximately 
we expect that income from these investments may decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an expected lower average balance of invested funds 
we have completed four financings over the past three years in june  we completed a private placement with three large institutional investors 
we received approximately  in net proceeds after deducting costs and expenses 
the investors purchased  shares of our common stock at at the price per share and were issued two year warrants which expired in to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
in addition to the cash offering costs of  the placement agent in the offering was issued five year warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares at per share  which expire in june in january  we received gross proceeds of approximately  from the sale of  shares of our common stock and net proceeds of approximately  after the deduction of fees and expenses  pursuant to a shelf registration statement on form s filed with the 
table of contents securities and exchange commission in october  allowing us to sell up to  of our common stock  debt securities and or warrants to purchase our securities 
in march  we received gross proceeds of approximately  from the sale of  shares of our common stock and net proceeds of approximately  after the deduction of fees and expenses  pursuant to the shelf registration statement referred to above 
in december  we received gross proceeds of approximately  from the sale of  shares of our common stock and net proceeds of approximately  after the deduction of fees and expenses  pursuant to a shelf registration statement on form s filed with the securities and exchange commission in september  allowing us to sell up to  of our common stock  debt securities and or warrants to purchase our securities 
the actual and planned uses of proceeds from all of the above financings include the continued development of our two lead compounds  cap and oxi  in oncology and ophthalmology 
we expect to continue to pursue strategic alliances and consider joint development opportunities that may provide us with access to organizations that have capabilities and or products that are complementary to our own in order to continue the development of our potential product candidates 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
available for sale securities we view our marketable securities as available for use in our current operations  and accordingly designate our marketable securities as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we review the status of the unrealized gains and losses of our available for sale marketable securities on a regular basis 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in investment income 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in investment income 
securities in an unrealized loss position deemed not to be other than temporarily impaired  due to management s positive intent and ability to hold the securities until anticipated recovery  with maturation greater than twelve months are classified as long term assets 
research and development we charge all research and development expenses  both internal and external costs  to operations as incurred 
currently  greater than of our research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations  product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of our potential product candidates 
we recognize expense associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in our contracts with them 
costs incurred 
table of contents under fixed fee contracts are accrued ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably 
costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patients treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract 
in determining costs incurred on some of these programs  we take into consideration a number of factors  including estimates and input provided by our internal program managers 
upon termination of such contracts  we are normally only liable for costs incurred or committed to date 
as a result  accrued research and development expenses represent our estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any of the relevant times 
impairment of long lived assets on august   we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development  use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by arizona state university 
the present value of the amount payable under the license agreement has been capitalized based on a discounted cash flow model and is being amortized over the term of the agreement approximately years 
we update our analysis and review this asset for impairment on a regular basis or if indicators of impairment are present using an undiscounted net cash flows approach  in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
this analysis includes a number of significant estimates and assessments  including the likelihood of clinical trial success  primary and secondary market opportunities  competition  pricing  and potential partnership options at different phases of development 
sfas requires that if the undiscounted cash flows of an intangible asset are less than the carrying value of an intangible asset  the intangible asset is written down to the discounted cash flow value 
differences in estimates used in assessing the recoverability of these assets could result in impairment charges  which could have a material impact on our results of operations 
to date  we have not recorded any impairment in this recorded asset since its initial capitalization 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which requires the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share based payments issued to employees 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the estimated fair value associated with such awards was not recorded as an expense  but rather was disclosed in a footnote to our financial statements 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we use the black scholes pricing model  which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value the stock option exercise price  the expected term of the option  the grant date price of our common stock  which is issuable upon exercise of the option  the expected volatility of our common stock  the expected dividends on our common stock we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  and the risk free interest rate for the expected option term stock option exercise price and grant date price of our common stock the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 

table of contents expected term the expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of option plan participants over time and a review of other similar companies in the biotechnology field 
expected volatility the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the options granted 
we determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term 
expected dividends we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant 
of the variables above  the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective 
the majority of the stock option expense recorded in fiscal relates to continued vesting of stock options and restricted stock that were granted prior to january  in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas r  the grant date estimates of fair value associated with prior awards  which were also calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  have not been changed 
the specific valuation assumptions that were utilized for purposes of deriving an estimate of fair value at the time that prior awards were issued are as disclosed in our prior annual reports on form k  as filed with the sec 
upon adoption of sfas r  we were also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
this requirement applies to all awards that are not yet vested  including awards granted prior to january  accordingly  we performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting  and ultimately recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate 
in our calculation  we segregated participants into two distinct groups  directors and officers and employees 
this analysis will be re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate will be adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
changes in the inputs and assumptions  as described above  can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
as of december   there was approximately  of unrecognized compensation cost related to stock option awards that is expected to be recognized as expense over a weighted average period of years 
recent accounting pronouncements in september   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  entitled fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on july   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  entitled accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to fas this includes tax positions considered to be routine  as well as those with a high degree of uncertainty 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the application of fin to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and revenues we did not recognize any licensing revenue during the fiscal year ended december  and recognized licensing revenue of approximately  during the fiscal year ended december  these amounts were received in connection with the license of our nutritional and diagnostic technology 
future revenues  if any  from this license agreement are expected to be minimal 
our future revenues are dependent upon our ability to establish collaborations and generate revenues from products currently under development by us 
we expect that we will not generate meaningful revenue in fiscal unless and until we enter into new collaborations providing for funding whether through the payment of licensing fees  up front payments or otherwise 
costs and expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total expenses of total of total operating operating amount expenses amount expenses increase decrease research and development general and administrative total operating expenses we expect that as we continue to develop our two lead potential product candidates  cap and oxi  the percentage of research and development expenses to total operating expenses will continue to increase 
research and development expenses the table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages of of total expense operating amount category amount expenses increase decrease employee compensation and related external services stock based compensation other total research and development increases in both employee compensation and related expenses and external services related expenses account for of the increase in research and development expenses overall 
the increase in employee compensation and related costs is attributable to both a restructuring charge of approximately  in the third quarter of fiscal and an increase in the average number of employees in fiscal over fiscal of approximately 
the purpose for the restructuring was primarily to streamline the clinical development operations in order to improve the effectiveness of efforts to develop our potential product candidates 

table of contents external services expenses are comprised of costs incurred for consultants and contractors that assist in the management and support of our development programs 
the increase in these costs in fiscal over fiscal is attributable to the further development of our two primary potential product candidates  cap in both oncology and ophthalmology and oxi in oncology 
the increase in stock based compensation expense is attributable to the adoption of sfas r in requiring the recognition of an expense for all stock based compensation awards 
we expect that with the continued development of our two lead candidates  cap and oxi  in our two main focus indications  oncology and ophthalmology  as well as our discovery efforts for novel new compounds  our research and development expenses will continue to increase 
as a result  we expect that the percentage of external services expenses to total research and development expenses will continue to increase as well 
general and administrative expenses the table below summarizes the most significant components of our general and administrative expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total general and administrative expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages of of total expense operating amount category amount expenses increase decrease employee compensation and related consulting and professional services facilities related stock based compensation other total research and development the single largest increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal from fiscal related to stock based compensation 
this increase was due to our adoption of sfas r in as well as recognition of a full year of expense for restricted stock granted in the fourth quarter of the resulting adoption of sfas r requires the recognition of an expense for all stock based compensation awards 
the increase in employee compensation and related expenses is attributable to costs of approximately  in the second quarter of in connection with a change in senior management and an increase in average number of employees of approximately 
this was offset by a decrease in consulting and professional services costs primarily in connection with market analysis work we incurred in fiscal and did not repeat in fiscal we expect that we will continue to incur general and administrative expenses at an appropriate level to support the ongoing development of our potential product candidates and to meet the requirements of being a public company 
other income and expenses investment income increased by approximately  or  in fiscal  compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher average interest rates and returns on investments and  to a lesser extent  higher average cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities balances during the respective periods 
tax matters as of december   we had net operating loss carry forwards of approximately  for us income tax purposes  which expire through due to the degree of uncertainty related to the ultimate 
table of contents use of these loss carry forwards  we have fully reserved this future benefit 
additionally  the future utilization of the us net operating loss carry forwards is subject to limitations under the change in stock ownership rules of the internal revenue service 
the valuation allowance increased by approximately  and approximately  for the years ended december  and  respectively  due primarily to the increase in net operating loss carry forwards 
years ended december  and revenues we recognized licensing revenue of approximately  and  during the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
these amounts were received in connection with the license of our nutritional and diagnostic technology

in general  we increased the average number of our employees by approximately 
as noted above  the increase in the research and development average number of employees in was approximately 
accordingly  in fiscal we also increased the level of administrative support for the research and development group 
this included the modification of our lease at our waltham  massachusetts headquarters which resulted in an additional charge of approximately  in addition  in  we incurred increased costs to recruit key members of the board of directors 
other income and expenses investment income increased by approximately  or in fiscal  or  compared to fiscal  primarily due to higher average interest rates and returns on investments and  to a lesser extent  higher average cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities balances during the respective periods 
liquidity and capital resources to date  we have financed our operations principally through net proceeds received from private and public equity financing 
we have experienced net losses and negative cash flow from operations each year since our inception  except in fiscal as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we expect to incur increased expenses  resulting in losses  over at least the next several years due to  among other factors  our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development activities 
we had cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities of approximately  at december

proceeds from issuance of common stock relates to the exercise of stock options 
we anticipate that our cash  cash equivalents and available for sale marketable securities  will be sufficient to satisfy the company s projected cash requirements at least through the first half of our primary anticipated uses of funds during the fiscal year involve the preclinical and clinical developments of our product candidate under development and potential in licenses or other acquisition of technology 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned for or anticipated by management due to numerous risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the progress of and results of our pre clinical testing and clinical trials of our vdas and oqps under development  including cap  our lead compound  and oxi  the progress of our research and development programs  the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals  the resources  if any  that we devote to developing manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  our ability to enter into licensing arrangements  including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs  the costs and expenses of filing  prosecuting and  if necessary  enforcing our patent claims  or defending ourselves against possible claims of infringement by us of third party patent or other technology rights  the costs of commercialization activities and arrangements  if any  undertaken by us  and  if and when approved  the demand for our products  which demand is dependent in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known  understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval  for example the range of indications for which any product is granted approval 
if our existing funds are not sufficient to continue operations  we would be required to seek additional funding and or take other measures 
if additional financing is needed  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms when needed  if at all

the amounts in the table above assume the successful completion  by the third party contractor  of all of the activities contemplated in the agreements 
in addition  not included in operating leases above  is sublease income which totals approximately  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
our primary drug development programs are based on a series of natural products called combretastatins 
in august  we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development  use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by arizona state university 
this agreement was subsequently amended in june from the inception of the agreement through december   we have paid a total of  in connection with this license 
the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals  which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones  as defined in the agreement 
the license agreement also provides for additional payments upon our election to develop certain additional compounds  as defined in the agreement 
future milestone payments under this agreement could total  we are also required to pay royalties on future net sales of products associated with these patent rights 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we did not hold any derivative financial instruments  commodity based instruments or other long term debt obligations 
we have adopted an investment policy  the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in us dollar accounts 
although we conduct a number of our trials and studies outside of the us  we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be limited as the arrangements are in jurisdictions with relatively stable currencies
