certain statements set forth below constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  referred to as the reform act 
see special note regarding forward looking statements under item and risk factors under item a 
general we are a pharmaceutical company focused on the development of proprietary therapies for the treatment of cancer 
our lead compound  tpi is currently undergoing human clinical trials 
we are also engaged in evaluating new therapeutic agents and or related technologies 
our evaluation of new products and technologies may involve the examination of individual molecules  classes of compounds  or platform technologies  in cancer as well as other therapeutic areas 
acquisitions of new products or technologies may involve the purchase or licensing of such products or technologies  or the acquisition of  or merger with  other companies 
we have incurred significant losses  including losses from continuing operations of million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
our accumulated deficit was million as of december  we anticipate that losses will continue until such time  if ever  as we are able to generate sufficient sales to support our development operations  including the research and development activity discussed above 
our ability to generate sufficient sales to support our operations currently depends primarily upon the successful development and commercialization of products 
our oncology program consists of developing both targeted as well as non targeted chemical compounds for the treatment of cancer 
all of our products and technologies are in the early stages of development and we cannot assure you that our efforts will be successful 
reverse stock split we have implemented a one for ten reverse split of our common stock effective for trading on february  all share and per share amounts for all periods presented prior to fiscal have been restated to reflect this reverse stock split 
private placement on april  we sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase up to  shares of common stock for a total of million excluding any proceeds that might be received upon exercise of the warrants or approximately million  net of the placement agent fees and other expenses  pursuant to a purchase agreement dated february  the purchase agreement 
the purchase price was per share of common stock  and each warrant to purchase common stock has an exercise price equal to per share 
we may call up to of the outstanding warrants during any three month period if certain conditions are satisfied  including the trading price of our common stock exceeding for consecutive trading days 
up to half of the warrants may be exercised on a cashless or net exercise basis 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will receive funds from the exercise of warrants 
in addition  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to a financial advisor and issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock to an outside consultant as a finders fee on substantially similar terms as the warrants issued under the purchase agreement 
in connection with the private placement  we entered into a registration rights agreement wherein we agreed to make the requisite sec filings to achieve and substantially maintain the effectiveness of a registration statement covering shares sold in the private placement  as well as shares underlying warrants issued in the private placement 
if the company fails to maintain effectiveness of that registration statement through as late as april  subject to the company s right to suspend use of the registration statement in certain circumstances we will be obligated to pay liquidated damages  in an amount up to of the purchase price paid by the investors for each day period or pro rata for any portion thereof during which the registration statement should have been effective 
pursuant to the purchase agreement  we are required to use the net proceeds from the private placement solely to fund the development of our tpi compound in accordance with a budget for calendar years and that was adopted by our board of directors prior to the closing of the private placement 
any amendment or variance with respect to such aspect of the budget will require the prior written approval of a majority of the independent members of the board of directors 
research and development our current business is focused on research and development of proprietary therapies for the treatment of cancer 
in and  we were also engaged in development of genomic technologies 
in and  we were engaged in research and development related to our paclitaxel business 
costs relating to genomic technologies  excluding the huntington s disease program  and the paclitaxel business  are aggregated in discontinued operations 
during the last three fiscal years  we have incurred the following expenses related to research and development projects in thousands oncology huntington s disease discontinued operations research and development  which includes the cost of our clinical programs  will continue to be the most significant expense of our business for the foreseeable future 
our research and development activity is subject to change as we develop a better understanding of our projects and their prospects 
we filed an oncology ind application in december and were cleared by the fda in january to proceed into clinical trials 
we commenced phase i clinical trials in may with a qd dosing regimen 
in january  we commenced a second phase i study with an alternative qd dosing regiment 
in october  we reached the maximum tolerated dose mtd in our once every day phase i trial 
in addition  we are continuing to recruit patients in our once every day phase i trial 
we expect to begin treating patients in our first phase ii trial of tpi in prostate cancer in the first half of fiscal additional phase ii studies in other indications will follow thereafter 
our phase ii trials are designed to determine in what tumor type our compound might be advanced for phase iii studies 
as we recruit patients for these first phase ii studies  and others to follow  we will see an increase in our clinical spending 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to achieve our goals relating to these programs 
we also cannot estimate the cost necessary to complete the programs or the timing of material net cash inflows from these programs  if ever 
continued development of these programs is dependent upon raising additional capital 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain capital on acceptable terms 
we have included a number of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing our product development plans on schedule in the special note regarding forward looking statements and risk factors described in this report 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  research and development expense 
research and development expense from continuing operations for was million  a decrease of  from the prior year 
oncology research and development expenditures increased by  to million for  and huntington s disease related spending decreased by  to 
the gain related to the huntington s disease program was a result of a reversal of laboratory fees owed to a research university as well as a reduction in work force 
the increase in oncology expense was due to an increase in compensation costs million  increased clinical trial cost  as well as increased supplies costs  legal fees  and insurance  offset by reductions in outside manufacturing costs million associated with preparing active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product material for the clinical trials of tpi the increase in compensation expense for was primarily related to the non cash compensation expense in the amount of million for compared to  for  as a result of the implementation of sfas r and the modifications of vested stock options 
in addition  in the first quarter of  we recorded a  charge in connection with the termination of the employment of the company s executive vice president and secretary

the increase was attributable to higher interest income due to higher investment balances and higher effective interest rates earned in the year ended december  compared to the prior year period 
interest and other expense 
interest and other expense for of  was  less than the prior year period as the result of the repurchase of notes payable to tl ventures in november of impairment charges

there where no impairment charges from continuing operations in discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations was  in compared to million in the prior year 
the loss was due to the remaining activity related to the closure of the genomics division 
the loss in was primarily due to the closure of the genomics division million  partially offset by million of proceeds from the settlement of litigation against mylan laboratories related to the paclitaxel business that we sold in research and development expense included in discontinued operations was  in compared to million in the decrease in expense was due to the closure of the delaware facility  which resulted in costs consisting of occupancy charges associated with the closure and patent legal charges 
there were no general and administrative expenses included in discontinued operations in or liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements for operations have been  and will continue to be  significant 
as of december   we had a working capital balance of million compared to a working capital balance of million at december  through december   we have funded our capital requirements primarily with the net proceeds of public offerings of common stock  with private placements of equity securities  with the exercise of warrants and options and with debt 
we have also funded our capital requirements with the proceeds of the sale of our paclitaxel business approximately million to mayne pharma usa inc f k a faulding pharmaceutical  inc  a subsidiary of mayne group limited  on december  reverse stock split and nasdaq listing our common stock is listed on the nasdaq capital market 
in order to maintain that listing  we must satisfy minimum financial and other requirements 
on february   we received notice from the nasdaq stock market  inc that our common stock had not met the per share minimum bid price requirement for consecutive business days and that  if we were unable to demonstrate compliance with this requirement during the applicable grace periods  our common stock would be delisted after that time 
on february   we effectuated a one for ten reverse stock split to regain compliance with this listing requirement 
since the reverse stock split was effectuated  the closing bid price of our common stock has remained above in compliance with the minimum bid price requirement 
notes payable on november   we repurchased two non interest bearing promissory notes issued by us to tl ventures v lp and tl ventures v interfund lp in february the notes 
the notes had an outstanding principal balance of million 
the notes were repurchased for an aggregate payment of million in cash 
the repurchase of the notes did not have a material impact on our financial results

the purchase price was per share of common stock  and each warrant to purchase common stock has an exercise price equal to per share 
we may call up to of the outstanding warrants during any three month period if certain conditions are satisfied  including the trading price of our common stock exceeding for consecutive trading days 
up to half of the warrants may be exercised on a cashless or net exercise basis 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will receive funds from the exercise of warrants 
other in december of  we terminated our technology license agreement with the university of delaware and thomas jefferson university relating to the use of proprietary oligonucleotides dna fragments designed to precisely alter genes in humans  animals  plants  viruses and microbes 
the license provided for research and patent funding commitments and payments in common stock 
as of december   we had issued  shares of common stock under the license to the university of delaware   shares to thomas jefferson university and  shares to the samuel roberts noble foundation  inc  each of which had an ownership interest in the licensed intellectual property 
there were no issuances of common stock in under this agreement 
liquidity we have no revenue and we have incurred losses of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
we have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  as of december   we had cash and short term investments totaling approximately million 
our capital requirements for research and development  including the cost of clinical trials  have been and will continue to be significant 
we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our operations and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
pharmaceutical development is a costly  risky and time intensive activity 
to bring our various programs to completion will require us to raise additional capital in the near future 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional capital on terms that will be acceptable to us or on any terms 
in addition  we may seek to in license or purchase new products or technologies 
the cost and related capital expenditures of acquiring and developing such resources may be significant  and we may not be able to obtain capital for the development of these products or technologies 
see risk factors under item a above 
working capital and cash flow 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december  and million at december   an increase of million 
for the year ending december   the net cash used in operating activities was million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  primarily due to net purchases of investments 
net cash provided by financing operations during the fiscal year was million due to financing that occurred during the second quarter offset by the payment of notes payable in conjunction with the payoff of the tl ventures debt 
our cash used in operating activities was primarily used to advance our product development efforts and for general corporate purposes 
the majority of our future cash expenditures are expected to continue to be used to advance our product development programs including clinical trials of our tpi program as well as for general corporate purposes 
capital expenditures 
we spent  during for capital projects 
we expect capital expenditures to increase during the primary focus of capital spending during is expected to be in support of our research and development activities as well as to fund additional equipment related to an anticipated consolidation of our administrative and research and development facilities 
we may seek additional financing to fund our capital expenditures 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing on terms that are acceptable to us 
net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  contains provisions that may limit the tax net operating losses nol and tax credits available for use in any given year upon the occurence of certain events  including significant changes in ownership interest 
a change in ownership of a company as defined in section of the code within a three year period results in an annual limitation on the company s ability to utilize its nol and credit carryforwards from tax periods prior to the ownership change 
as a result of the private placement of equity securities in april  which is considered to be a significant change in ownership for tax purposes  under the code  our nol and tax credit carryforwards as of december  are subject to such limitations 
we believe that we will not be able to utilize a significant portion of our nol and tax credits 
business development activities 
in the normal course of our business  we investigate  evaluate  and discuss licensing relationships  acquisitions  and other business combination opportunities 
in the event we enter into any such relationships or transactions  we may consider using available cash  issuing equity securities or increasing our debt 
such transactions could materially affect our capital structure 
critical accounting policies we have identified certain accounting policies as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations are discussed throughout this item where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets policy in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  we review the carrying amount of long lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired 
if this review indicates long lived assets will not be recoverable as determined based on the undiscounted cash flow estimated to be generated by these assets  we reduce the carrying amount of these long lived assets to estimated fair value or discounted cash flow  as appropriate 
in the second quarter of  we recognized an impairment on the value of land of  and in the third quarter recognized an impairment of  on the value of our investment in chromadex 
in  we recognized an impairment loss of  associated with the gene isolation and service business due to our decision to discontinue our efforts in that business and our inability to find a buyer for the assets 
also in  as part of our preparation of the financial statements  we recognized an impairment loss of million in connection with the closure of our genomics division 
these impairments are included in discontinued operations 
such impairment losses were the only impairment charges of long lived assets recorded in the fiscal years ended december  and december  there was no impairment of assets in stock based compensation on december   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock based on estimated fair values 
sfas r supersedes our previous accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
under the provisions of apb and its related interpretations  no compensation expense was recognized with respect to the grant to employees of options to purchase our common stock when such stock options were granted with exercise prices equal to or greater than market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of december   the first day of our fiscal year 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended december  reflect the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r for the fiscal year ended december  was million or 
basic and diluted loss per share from continuing operations 
included in the stock based compensation expense for the fiscal year ended december   is a one time non cash fixed period charge in the amount of  as a result of the modification of vested options on april  as discussed in note equity incentive plans 
the stock based compensation expense is calculated on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the related options 
this charge had no impact on the company s reported cash flows 
investments short term investments consist of commercial paper  investment grade government agency  auction rate  and corporate debt securities due within one year 
investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short term based on their highly liquid nature and because such investments represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations 
the company s investments in auction rate securities are recorded at cost  which approximates fair market value 
in accordance with arb  restatement and revision of accounting research bulletins  despite the long term nature of their stated contractual maturities  the company has the ability and the intent to liquidate investments in auction rate securities within six months and therefore has classified these investments as short term 
the company s investments are classified as available for sale  and are reported at market value as of the balance sheet date 
interest income is recognized when earned 
the unrealized gains and losses are reported as a separate component of stockholder s equity until the security is sold or until a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
the company s investment in chromadex  inc is accounted for under the cost method 
under the cost method  the investment is carried at cost and adjusted only for other than temporary declines in fair value  distributions of earnings or additional investments 
see note investment in chromadex  inc  for further information on chromadex 
future contractual obligations the table below summarizes our future contractual obligations at december  in thousands less than after total year years years years capital lease operating leases total in february  we leased  square feet of office space in roseland  new jersey for research and development support 
the lease runs through december  and requires monthly rental payments of we have employment agreements with key employees 
these employment agreements contain provisions regarding the termination of employment including termination of employment associated with a change in control as defined 
these termination benefits range from to of the employee s base salary for the prior month period immediately preceding the termination date  payment of any accrued but unpaid salary  bonus and vacation and payment of up to of the prior year bonus or of base salary for the prior month period 
impact of recent accounting pronouncements on june   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
sfas no 
replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  and changes the requirements for the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle 
sfas no 
applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle 
it also applies to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the unusual instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions 
sfas no 
must be adopted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  early adoption is permitted for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after the date sfas no 
is issued 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial results 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
interpretation  which clarifies statement  accounting for income taxes  establishes the criterion that an individual tax position has to meet for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in our financial statements 
on initial application  interpretation will be applied to all tax positions for which the statute of limitations remains open 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the adoption date will be recognized or continue to be recognized 
the cumulative effect of applying interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period in which it is adopted 
interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will be adopted by the company on december  the company currently does not believe that the adoption of interpretation will have a significant effect on its financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we will be required to adopt sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal year management has not yet determined the impact of adopting this statement 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we currently invest our excess cash balances in money market accounts  and short term investments that are subject to interest rate risk 
the amount of interest income we earn on these funds will decline if interest rates decline 
our investments are subject to a loss of principal with an increase in interest rates if sold prior to their maturity 
however  due to the short term nature of the majority of our investments  the high credit quality of our portfolio and our ability to hold our investments until maturity  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
