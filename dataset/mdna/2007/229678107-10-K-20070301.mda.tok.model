overview cubist is a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in lexington  massachusetts  focused on the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products that address unmet medical needs in the acute care environment 
we have one marketed product  cubicin  which was launched in the us in november cubicin is currently the only marketed once daily  bactericidal  intravenous iv antibiotic 
cubicin is approved in the us for the treatment of csssi  caused by s 
aureus and certain other gram positive bacteria  and for s 
aureus bloodstream infections bacteremia  including those with right sided infective endocarditis  caused by methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant isolates 
in the eu  cubicin is approved for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections  or cssti  caused by certain gram positive bacteria and is under regulatory review for an expanded label 
our focus in was to continue the successful promotion and development of cubicin by seeking additional indications 
on may   the fda approved cubicin for the additional indication of s 
aureus  bloodstream infections bacteremia  including those with right sided infective endocarditis  caused by methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant isolates 
we expanded our sales force in the first quarter of in anticipation of the fda approval and trained our sales organization on the details of this important new indication in connection with the approval 
in june  we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes resulting in net proceeds to cubist  after debt issuance costs  of million 
we used a portion of the proceeds from this offering to repay the principal and outstanding interest of our million aggregate principal amount of convertible subordinated notes  plus a prepayment penalty 
this prepayment resulted in charges of million related to the prepayment penalty and the write off of debt issuance costs associated with the debt 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  were million 
in january  the european medicines agency  or emea  granted chiron marketing approval for cubicin in the eu  for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections  or cssti  where the presence of susceptible gram positive bacteria is confirmed or suspected 
in april  novartis ag acquired chiron  and  currently  both novartis ag and its subsidiary chiron carry out activities under our license agreement 
novartis began its launch of cubicin in the united kingdom  ireland  benelux  spain  austria  denmark  finalnd  norway and germany in in july  novartis filed an additional marketing authorization application  or maa  with the emea for an expanded cubicin label in the eu to include s 
aureus bacteremia including infective endocarditis based on the phase study which supported our may  label expansion 
in december  astrazeneca licensed rights to cubicin in china as well as all otherwise unlicensed cubicin territories other than japan 
we are seeking to name a cubicin partner for japan  the last unpartnered country outside the us we continue to sell cubicin in the us in accordance with our drop ship program under which orders are processed through wholesalers but shipments are sent directly to our end users 
this provides us with greater visibility into end user ordering and reordering trends 
we outsource many of our supply chain activities  including i manufacturing and supplying cubicin api  ii converting cubicin api into its finished  vialed and packaged formulation  iii managing warehousing and distribution of cubicin to our customers  and iv performing the order processing  order fulfillment  shipping  collection and invoicing services related to our cubicin product sales 
we have focused our pipeline building efforts on opportunities that leverage our antiinfective and acute care discovery  development  regulatory  and commercialization expertise 
we are currently working to identify viable gram positive and gram negative candidates from our lipopeptide program 
we are also working with ilypsa to develop a non antibiotic  toxin binder therapy for the treatment of c 
difficile associated diarrhea cdad 
in the third quarter of  we decided to discontinue investment in the hepex b program and are currently investigating strategic options for this investigational drug to treat patients who have had a liver transplant secondary to hepatitis b 
we continue to evaluate acute care product candidates which we might acquire to build our pipeline 
since our inception  we have incurred net losses in every fiscal period until the third quarter of principally as a result of research and development efforts  preclinical testing  clinical trials  and administrative costs 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues the following table sets forth revenues for the years ended december  and december  change in millions product revenues  net other revenues total revenues  net product revenues  net net sales of cubicin were million and million in and  respectively 
gross sales of cubicin totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and are offset by million and million of allowances for sales returns  medicaid rebates  chargebacks  prompt pay discounts  wholesaler management fees and customer rebates 
the increase in revenue was primarily due to increased customer volume 
also impacting net product revenues was a price increase in october and an additional price increase in may included in net product revenues for the year ended december  is million of international sales 
we generally do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin 
we have a drop ship program in place through which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and out patient administration location purchases of our product 
in the future  we may shift from the drop ship program to a program that may allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  however  we have not determined if or when the change will occur 
if we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  our net product sales may be impacted by the timing of wholesaler inventory stocking purchases and provisions for returns based on estimated product in the distribution channel 
leading wholesalers have begun to seek various fees for data supply and administration services 
net product revenue is reduced by any such fees paid to the wholesalers 
other revenues other revenues for the year ended december   were million as compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
the decrease in other revenues is primarily due to a decrease in revenue related to our license agreement with novartis 
other revenues under this agreement totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  other revenues under this agreement recognized in the year ended december  consisted of payments received as a result of regulatory and pricing approvals for cubicin in europe which were recognized as revenue upon their receipt 
other revenues under this agreement recognized in the year ended december  consisted of the recognition of million of previously deferred upfront payments and million of development revenue 
the upfront payments totaled million  and included a million premium paid upon purchasing our common stock 
this million was recorded as deferred revenue and was amortized to license fee revenues over the estimated development period of the agreement of two years which was completed in september also included in other revenues for the year ended december  and are small business innovation research  or sbir  grant revenue of million and million  respectively 
costs and expenses the following table sets forth costs and expenses for the years ended december  and december  change in millions cost of product revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses cost of product revenues cost of product revenues were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
our gross margin for the year ended december   was as compared to for the year ended december   primarily due to reduced overall pricing from our manufacturing vendors as well as higher volume resulting in lower cost per unit sold 
included in our cost of product revenues are royalties owed to eli lilly on net sales of cubicin under our license agreement with eli lilly 
in march of  we issued to eli lilly million of our common stock in exchange for a reduction in the royalties payable to eli lilly 
in  we issued to eli lilly million of our common stock in exchange for a reduction in the royalties payable to eli lilly 
we also issued  shares of our common stock valued at million in as a milestone payment to eli lilly 
these amounts have been capitalized on our balance sheet as intangible assets and are amortized to cost of product revenues over the remaining life of our license agreement with eli lilly 
amortization included in cost of product revenues related to these expenses was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
as our production volumes increase  there is the potential for our gross margin to increase as we work to develop manufacturing process improvements 
whether that potential can be realized and the extent to which such potential can be realized are uncertain 
research and development expense total research and development expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to i an increase of million in payroll  benefits  travel and other employee related expenses due to increased headcount as well as non cash stock based compensation charges associated with the implementation of fas r  ii an increase of million in collaborations expense due primarily to costs associated with our ilypsa collaboration which we entered into in the second quarter of  iii an increase of million in process development costs associated with the development of our lipopeptide program  iv an increase of million in research grants  v an increase of million in lab supplies  equipment  and services  vi an increase of million in non clinical studies  and vii an increase of million in publications expense 
these increases were offset by i a decrease of million in clinical study costs due primarily to our decision to discontinue investment in our hepex b program as well as the completion of our clinical trial of cubicin in the treatment of bacteremia with known or suspected endocarditis caused by s 
aureus  ii a million decrease in medical education expense  and iii a million decrease in process development costs related to hepex b 
additionally  million of manufacturing development costs associated with our license agreement with novartis  and million of costs related to the establishment of a second api manufacturer and a second fill finish manufacturer for our cubicin product were incurred in and were not repeated in we expect to continue incurring substantial research and development expenses related to i phase and phase clinical trials for cubicin  ii pre clinical and clinical testing of other products under development  such as our lipopeptide program and potential compounds under our natural products screening program  iii regulatory matters  and iv medical affairs activities 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily due to an increase of million in payroll  benefits  travel and other employee related expenses due to our sales force expansion in the first quarter of and the non cash stock based compensation charges associated with the implementation of fas r 
also included in sales and marketing expense is an increase of million in promotional programs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or

we fund our cash requirements through the following methods sales of cubicin  payments from our strategic collaborators including license fees  royalties and milestone payments  sponsored research funding and research grants  equity and debt financings  and interest earned on invested capital 
we have incurred net losses since our inception until the third quarter of  principally as a result of research and development efforts including pre clinical testing and clinical trials

accounts receivable increased million due to increased sales of cubicin 
inventory increased million primarily due to increased purchases from our manufacturing vendors as we build a sufficient supply of cubicin to meet projected sales requirements 
these uses of cash were offset by a million increase in deferred revenue  primarily due to the receipt of a million upfront payment from astrazeneca 
this upfront fee was received as part of our entering into a license agreement with astrazeneca for the development and commercialization of cubicin in china and certain other countries in asia  the middle east and africa not yet covered by existing cubicin international partnering agreements 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to million provided by investing activities in and million used in investing activities in cash used in investing activities in represents cash outflows from the purchase of securities  as well as cash outflows for purchases of property and equipment

we have subleased the space located at sidney street through october the inventory purchase obligations listed above represent minimum volumes that we are required to purchase from our contract manufacturers 
the external collaboration listed above represents minimum royalties owed on sales of cubicin product 
critical accounting policies and estimates cubist prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures  actual amounts may differ 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  inventories  accrued clinical research costs  investments  long lived assets  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
i 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  as amended by sab  and emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
principal sources of revenue are sales of cubicin  license fees and milestone payments that are derived from collaborative agreements with other biopharmaceutical companies and distribution agreements 
we have followed the following principles in recognizing revenue product revenues  net we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  title to product and associated risk of loss has passed to the customer  the price is fixed or determinable  collection from the customer is reasonably assured and we have no further performance obligations 
provisions for returns  chargebacks  discounts  wholesaler management fees and rebates are recorded as a deduction to arrive at our net sales in the same period the related sales are recorded 
since the launch of cubicin in november  we generally have not allowed wholesalers to stock cubicin 
instead  we instituted a drop ship program that we have continued to maintain 
under our drop ship program  orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users  who are generally hospitals and outpatient administration centers 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and outpatient administration center purchases of our product  and also prevents unusual purchasing patterns since it closely tracks end user demand 
we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date 
our estimate of the provision for returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors  including industry data of product return rates  historical experience of actual returns  analysis of level inventory in the distribution channel  if any  and reorder rates of end users 
if the history of our product returns changes  the reserve will be adjusted appropriately 
if we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  our net product sales may be impacted by the timing of wholesaler inventory stocking and activity and provisions for returns which will be based on estimated product in the distribution channel that may not sell through to end users 
we analyze our estimates and assumptions for chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves quarterly 
our medicaid and chargeback reserves have two components i an estimate of outstanding claims for known end user rebate eligible sales that have occurred  but for which related claim submissions have not been received  and ii an estimate of chargebacks and medicaid rebates based on an analysis of customer sales mix data to determine which sales may flow through to a rebate or chargeback eligible customer 
because the second component is calculated based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  our assessment of distribution channel inventory levels impacts our estimated reserve requirements 
we accrue for the expected liability at the time we record the sale  however  the time lag between sale and payment of rebate can be lengthy 
due to the time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 
reserves for medicaid rebate programs are included in accrued liabilities and were  and  at december  and  respectively 
reserves for returns  discounts  chargebacks  wholesaler management fees and customer rebates are netted against accounts receivable and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
in the year ended december  and  provisions for sales returns  chargebacks  rebates  wholesaler management fees and prompt pay discounts that were netted against product revenues totaled million and million  respectively 
we believe that the reserves we have established are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
applying different judgments to the same facts and circumstances would result in the estimated amounts for sales returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves to vary 
however  due to the drop ship model that we currently operate under  and the low level of actual product returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate claims experienced to date  we do not expect that the differences would be material 
multiple element arrangements we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
we recognize up front license payments as revenue if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered items can be determined 
if the license is considered to have standalone value but the fair value on any of the undelivered items cannot be determined  the license payments are recognized as revenue over the period of performance for such undelivered items or services 
we have an arrangement that included an up front license payment and that obligated us to perform development services and to manufacture and supply drug product 
the pricing for the manufacturing and supply services was determined to be at fair value 
although the license was determined to have standalone value  we could not establish fair value for the development services and  as such  the license and development services were accounted for as a single unit of accounting 
accordingly  the up front license payment was recognized over the estimated development period of two years 
our estimate of the development period and our determination that the terms of the manufacturing and supply agreement are at fair value both involve management judgment 
license revenues non refundable license fees are recognized depending on the provisions of each agreement 
license fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations are recorded as deferred revenue once received and are generally recognized ratably over the period of such performance obligation only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered 
if an agreement contains product development services  the relevant time period for the product development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized and as a result  management reviews the estimates related to the relevant time period of product development quarterly 
milestones revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
contingent payments under license agreements that do not involve substantial effort on the part of the company are not considered substantive milestones 
such payments are recognized as revenue when the contingency is met only if there are no remaining performance obligations or any remaining performance obligations are priced at fair value 
otherwise  the contingent payment is recognized as the company completes its performance obligations under the arrangement 
research services revenues from sbir grants to conduct research and development are recognized as the eligible costs are incurred up to the granted funding limit 
ii 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  basis 
included in the cost of inventories are employee stock based compensation costs capitalized under sfas r 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels  and write down inventory that is expected to expire prior to being sold  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  inventory in excess of expected sales requirements  or inventory that has been deemed no longer suitable for commercial sale through a charge to cost of product revenues 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off 
charges for inventory write downs are not reversed if it is later determined that the product is saleable  therefore  any such inventory would be sold at zero cost 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
iii 
accrued clinical research costs we utilize external entities such as contract research organizations  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
we record costs for clinical study activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each study  and include these costs in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
contracts and studies vary significantly in length  and are generally composed of a fixed management fee  variable indirect reimbursable costs that have a dollar limit cap  and amounts owed on a per patient enrollment basis 
we monitor the activity levels and patient enrollment levels of the studies to the extent possible through communication with the service providers  detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of actual expenses against budget  pre approval of any changes in scope  and review of contractual terms 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs 
clinical trial expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the level of clinical study expense may vary from period to period based on the number of studies that are in process  the duration of the study  the required level of patient enrollment  and the number of sites involved in the study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those with a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements and that span multiple years 
if we receive incomplete or inaccurate information from our third party service providers  we may under or over estimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to prior period accruals that increase or reverse research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known

investments it is our intent to hold all investments to maturity in accordance with our investment policy 
however  if the circumstances regarding an investment were to change  such as a change in an investment s external credit rating  we would consider a sale of the related security to minimize any losses 
the appropriateness of all investment classifications is reviewed at each reporting date 
v 
long lived assets in the ordinary course of our business  we incur substantial costs to purchase and construct property  plant and equipment 
the treatment of costs to purchase or construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction 
we generally depreciate plant and equipment using the straight line method over the asset s estimated economic life  which ranges from years to years 
determining the economic lives of plant and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment primarily consists of our corporate headquarters building 
as of december   there were approximately million of net other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet  which consisted of patents  intellectual property  acquired technology rights  manufacturing rights  and other intangibles 
we amortize our intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from years to years 
determining the economic lives of intangible assets requires us to make significant judgment and estimates  and can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain long lived assets are impaired 
in  based on an internal analysis  we estimated that the undiscounted future cash flows from a patent  unrelated to its cubicin product  were less than its carrying value  indicating that the patent was impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in the quarter ended december  based upon the difference between the expected discounted future cash flows and its carrying value 
the million charge was recorded to general and administrative expense 
vi 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carry forwards  and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we determine that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
through december   we believe it is more likely than not that all of our deferred tax assets will not be realized and  accordingly  have recorded a valuation allowance against all deferred tax assets 
if results of operations in the future indicate that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be recovered  the reduction of the valuation allowance will be recorded as a tax benefit during one or over many periods

stock based compensation effective january   our accounting policy related to stock option accounting changed upon our adoption of sfas r 
sfas r requires us to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of share based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award generally the vesting period of the equity award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the share based award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the share based award and forfeiture rates 
in order to determine the fair value of share based awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on factual data derived from public sources 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the immediate future 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
estimating forfeitures also requires significant judgment 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on both current and historical volatilities of our stock which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that share based awards are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
we determine the expected life assumption based on the exercise behavior and post vesting behavior that has been exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience of share based pre vesting cancellations 
we believe that our estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
during the year ended december  we incurred million of compensation cost under sfas r 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted 
therefore  we will adopt sfas no 
on january  sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement codifies the definition of fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
the standard clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the implementation of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin topic n sab  financial statements considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab  which is effective for calendar year companies as of december  sab provides guidance on how prior year misstatements should be taken into consideration when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements for purposes of determining whether the financial statements are materially misstated 
under this guidance  companies should take into account both the effect of a misstatement on the current year balance sheet as well as the impact upon the current year income statement in assessing the materiality of a current year misstatement 
once a current year misstatement has been quantified  the guidance in sab topic m  financial statements materiality  or sab  should be applied to determine whether the misstatement is material 
the implementation of sab did not have an impact on the company s financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation requires that we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this interpretation 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  or sfas  which replaces apb opinion no 
 accounting changes  and fasb statement no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 
sfas changes the requirements of the accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle and also provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of error corrections 
prior to sfas  most voluntary changes in accounting principle were recognized by including in net income of the period of change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle 
sfas requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in accounting principle and to changes required by an accounting pronouncement in the instance that the pronouncement does not include specific transition provisions  unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on the company s results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 inventory costs  or sfas sfas requires abnormal amounts of inventory costs related to idle facility  freight handling and wasted material expenses to be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas requires that allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
the standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  the adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  principally securities issued by the us government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes  auction rate securities  and money market instruments 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
we currently own financial instruments that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio is used to preserve capital until it is required to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive instruments are held for trading purposes 
the investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these bonds are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to our policy to hold these instruments to maturity  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk 
as of december   the fair market value of our convertible subordinated notes due in amounted to million 
the estimated fair value of long term debt was determined using quoted market rates 
the interest rates on the convertible subordinated notes and capital lease obligation are fixed and are therefore not subject to interest rate risk
