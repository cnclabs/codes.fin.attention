we caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
many of our agreements contain multiple revenue elements including upfront payments  license fees  milestone payments  royalties  maintenance fees and payments received for the delivery of supplies or services 
each agreement may contain some or all of these elements and the assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate time  or period of time  that revenue should be recognized 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fees are fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
where activities represent the culmination of a separate earnings process and verifiable evidence of the fair value of each element can be established  revenue is recognized as the activities are completed 
when verifiable evidence of fair value cannot be established for each undelivered element  revenue is deferred until all elements have been delivered or until verifiable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered element can be determined 
where activities represent continuing obligations and fair value cannot be determined  revenue is recognized over the service period using either a time based or an activity based approach as appropriate in the circumstance 
nonrefundable upfront payments and maintenance and license fees  for which no further performance obligations exist are recognized as revenue on the earlier of when payments are received or when collection is assured 
when contracts include nonrefundable upfront payments  maintenance fees or license fees  including any guaranteed time based payments  that require continuing involvement in the form of development  manufacturing or other efforts by us  we evaluate whether verifiable evidence of fair value of the efforts to be provided exists 
if no such evidence exists  we recognize the payments received as revenue over the development period or other period over which services are to be provided 
payments for the achievement of substantive at risk milestones are generally recognized as revenue when the milestone is achieved 
however  payments for milestones which are not the result of the achievement of a substantive at risk milestone or from an arrangement that contains multiple delivery elements for which verifiable and objective evidence of fair value cannot be established for each element are recognized as revenue over the development period or other periods over which services are provided 
revenues from royalties on third party sales of licensed technologies are generally recognized in accordance with the contract terms when the royalties can be reliably determined and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also perform research and development activities on behalf of 
table of contents collaborative partners 
revenue from research and development services is generally recognized as the service is provided 
however  if the arrangement contains multiple delivery elements for which verifiable and objective evidence of fair value cannot be established for each element  payments for such services are recognized as revenue over the service period 
we generally bill the collaborator monthly  quarterly or upon the completion of the effort  based on the terms of each agreement 
amounts earned  but not billed to the collaborator  if any  are included in accounts receivable in the accompanying balance sheets 
amounts received in excess of amounts recognized as revenue are included in deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheets 
investments 
our investments are diversified among high credit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we classify our investments as available for sale  which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included as a component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than temporary are included in investment income 
to date  we have determined that unrealized losses are not significant and are temporary as to the extent of the decline in both dollars and percentage of cost  and we have the ability and intent to hold the investments until we recover at least substantially all of the cost of the investment 
the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility 
to date  the carrying values of our investments have not been written down due to declines in value because such declines are judged to be other than temporary 
declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
we make these estimates as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees paid to contract research organizations in conjunction with clinical trials  fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with manufacturing clinical grade materials and professional service fees 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries  benefits and other direct headcount related costs  third party contract and outside service fees and facilities and overhead expenses for drug discovery and research  preclinical studies and for costs associated with clinical trial activities and are expensed as incurred 
costs  including milestones and maintenance fees  to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that are not expected to have alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and recognize this cost  based on a variety of factors  beginning with the preparation for the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments to our contract research organizations for trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial  and other costs 
share based compensation 
we adopted the provisions of sfas r effective january   which results in the expensing of the fair value of share based payment transactions to be recognized in the financial statements 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management  including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options 
management also makes decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected stock price volatility and the 
table of contents risk free interest rate used in the model 
fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
for additional information see note of the notes to the financial statements included in this form k 
income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that net deferred assets will not be realized 
we believe that a full valuation allowance will be required on losses reported in future periods 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  a portion of which would increase income or decrease losses in the period in which such a determination was made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  accrued expenses  research and development  share based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
overview we are a biotechnology company developing monoclonal antibody based therapies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases 
our business strategy is focused on advancing our portfolio of product candidates in diseases with unmet medical need and significant market potential 
we currently have four product candidates in ongoing clinical trials  sgn  sgn  sgn and sgn in addition  we have two other lead preclinical product candidates  sgn and sgn our pipeline of product candidates is based upon two technologies genetically engineered monoclonal antibodies and monoclonal antibody drug conjugates adcs 
these technologies enable us to develop monoclonal antibodies that can kill target cells on their own as well as to increase the potency of monoclonal antibodies by linking them to a cell killing payload to form an adc 
in addition to our internal pipeline of product candidates  we have adc collaborations with leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including  genentech  bayer  curagen  progenics  medimmune  pdl biopharma and agensys 
we also have internal research and in licensing programs for novel antigens and new monoclonal antibodies to provide future opportunities for pipeline growth 
we do not currently have any commercial products for sale 
all of our product candidates are in relatively early stages of development and significant further research and development  financial resources and personnel will be required to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approvals 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
over the next several years  we expect to incur substantial expenses as we continue to invest in research  development and manufacturing and move towards commercialization of our product candidates 
our commitment of resources to research and the continued development and potential commercialization of our product candidates will require substantial additional funds and resources 
our operating expenses will likely increase as we invest in research or acquire additional technologies  as additional product candidates are selected for clinical development and as some of our earlier stage product candidates move into later stage clinical development 
in addition  we may incur significant milestone payment obligations as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards commercialization 
because a substantial portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future will depend on achieving development and clinical milestones under our existing collaboration and license agreements  particularly our sgn collaboration with genentech  as well as entering into new collaboration and license agreements  our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues in increased by to million from and increased in by to million from these increases primarily reflect the earned portion of technology access fees and milestone payments received under our adc collaborations as well as funded research and material supply fees 
revenues are summarized by collaborators as follows collaboration and license agreement revenues in thousands annual percentage change genentech curagen progenics medimmune bayer pdl biopharma genencor other collaborations total revenues in consist primarily of amounts earned under our genentech  curagen and progenics collaborations  which represent approximately million  or  of total collaboration and license agreement revenues

revenues in consist primarily of amounts earned under our genentech  pdl biopharma  curagen and genencor collaborations  which represent approximately million  or  of total collaboration and license agreement revenues 
these revenues will vary from year to year and from quarter to quarter depending on the development progress made by our collaborators with their product candidates 
genentech we entered into an adc collaboration with genentech in april  pursuant to which we have received technology access fees totaling million 
these fees are being recognized as revenue over the five year research period of the collaboration 
revenues in decreased by  or  from reflecting lower milestone payments and funded research and supply fees earned during the year 
revenues in increased by approximately million  or  compared to due primarily to higher technology access fees earned during the year 
in january  we entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement with genentech for the development and commercialization of sgn under the terms of the agreement  we received an upfront payment of million in february and are entitled to receive research and development funding  potential future milestone payments and royalties on product sales 
payments to be received from genentech during the six year development period will be recognized as revenue over the development period using a time based method 
we expect revenues earned from genentech to increase in as a result of this collaboration

revenues increased by  or  in reflecting a partial year s recognition of the upfront technology access fee 
we anticipate receiving additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as bayer s adc product candidate progresses through development and royalties on product sales 
pdl biopharma we entered into a collaboration agreement with eos biotechnology in june  which was assumed by pdl biopharma in upon its acquisition of eos biotechnology 
we amended the collaboration agreement in january technology access fees are being recognized as revenue over the four year research period beginning january revenues decreased approximately million  or  in due to lower research and material supply fees and milestone payments earned in compared to we anticipate receiving additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as pdl biopharma s adc product candidates progress through development and royalties on product sales 
genencor we entered into a collaboration with genencor in and in january the research period of the agreement expired

table of contents research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from and decreased to million in from our research and development expenses are summarized as follows research development in thousands annual percentage change research development and contract manufacturing clinical share based compensation expense total research expenses include  among other things  personnel  occupancy and laboratory expenses associated with the discovery and identification of new monoclonal antibodies and the development of novel classes of stable linkers and potent cell killing drugs 
research expenses also include research activities associated with our product candidates  such as preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies 
research expenses of million in increased less than from  primarily due to slightly higher personnel expenses 
the increase in research expenses in is net of lower in license fees paid to gain access to new technologies 
research expenses increased to million in from primarily due to higher personnel expenses  related general lab supplies  in license fees and depreciation related to new lab equipment purchases 
development and contract manufacturing expenses include personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and manufacturing of drug product for use in our clinical trials  including ind enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies 
development and contract manufacturing expenses also include quality control and assurance activities  including storage and shipment services of our drug product candidates 
development and contract manufacturing costs increased to million in from primarily due to the timing of manufacturing campaigns 
manufacturing costs decreased by million for sgn and decreased million for sgn in from  reflecting the substantial completion of related activities for those programs with abbott laboratories for sgn and albany molecular for sgn during contract manufacturing costs increased million for sgn and increased million for sgn in from primarily reflecting new activities with laureate pharma 
development and contract manufacturing expenses in also include increases in personnel expenses  lab supplies associated with higher staffing levels and depreciation expenses 
development and contract manufacturing costs decreased to million in from manufacturing costs decreased by million for sgn in from  reflecting the substantial completion of manufacturing activities during with abbott laboratories 
manufacturing costs increased by million in from for sgn contract manufacturing expenses in also reflect increases in staffing costs and quality control and assurance activities  including storage and shipment services of our drug product candidates 
clinical expenses include personnel expenses  travel  occupancy costs and external clinical trial costs including principal investigator fees  clinical site expenses  clinical research organization charges and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials 
clinical costs increased to million in from and increased to million in from in  clinical expenses increased due to higher personnel expenses and third party costs associated with sgn and sgn  which were partially offset by decreased third party costs due to the discontinuation of our sgn program 
in  clinical expenses increased due to higher personnel costs and expanded third party costs for our sgn phase i trials 
share based compensation expenses reflect the non cash charge relating to the adoption of fas r on january   which requires us to measure the fair value of all employee share based payments and recognize that value as an operating expense over the vesting period of the stock option 
approximately million was attributable to research and development expenses during 
table of contents we utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple projects  including our discovery and research programs directed towards identifying monoclonal antibodies and new classes of stable linkers and cell killing drugs 
many of our costs are not directly attributable to a specific project and we have not historically allocated our infrastructure costs or accounted for internal research and development costs on a project by project basis 
as a result  we do not report actual total costs incurred for each of our clinical and preclinical projects on a project by project basis 
we do  however  separately account for significant third party costs of development programs identified as product candidates for further preclinical and clinical development 
the following table shows expenses incurred for preclinical study support  contract manufacturing for clinical supplies and clinical trial services provided by third parties as well as milestone payments for in licensed technology for each of our product candidates and the remaining unallocated costs for such periods product candidates s in thousands annual percentage change years january  to december  sgn sgn sgn sgn sgn sgn total third party costs unallocated costs and overhead share based compensation expense total research and development our third party costs for sgn and sgn in included activities conducted by laureate pharma to perform scale up and gmp manufacturing to support clinical trials 
we expect third party costs for sgn and sgn to increase from amounts incurred in as pharmacology toxicology activities increase and clinical and manufacturing activities expand 
sgn third party costs in and are primarily attributable to contract manufacturing and preclinical studies necessary to initiate a phase i clinical trial in we expect third party costs for sgn to increase as we expand our clinical trials 
sgn costs primarily reflect third party clinical costs in and contract manufacturing costs incurred at abbott laboratories in we expect third party costs associated with clinical trials of sgn to increase as we continue to enroll patients and expand our sgn phase i and ii clinical trials and initiate additional trials 
such third party costs will be reimbursed by genentech under our new license agreement entered into in january for the worldwide development and commercialization of sgn sgn third party costs in are attributable to patient enrollments in our phase ii clinical trials in the united states and europe 
costs attributable to sgn were lower than costs in due to manufacturing activities for sgn at abbott laboratories that occurred in we have initiated clinical trials of sgn in cooperation with the national cancer institute nci  the costs of which will be incurred by the nci and not reflected in our future financial results 
as a result  we expect third party costs for sgn to decrease from the amounts incurred in as we conclude our company sponsored phase ii clinical trials 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization  the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that may take several years or more to complete 
the length of time varies substantially based upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  
table of contents the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the number of sites included in the trials  the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the safety and efficacy profile of the product candidate  the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our strategy may include entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates 
in these situations  the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate and the estimated completion date may largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
we anticipate that our research  development  contract manufacturing and clinical expenses will continue to grow in the foreseeable future as we expand our discovery and preclinical activities  as new product candidates enter clinical trials and as we advance our product candidates already in clinical trials to new clinical sites in north america and europe 
these expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in item a risk factors 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product candidate

in  the increase was primarily attributable to additional administrative personnel and recruiting fees 
share based compensation expense in reflect non cash charges relating to the adoption of fas r  which requires us to measure the fair value of all employee share based payments and recognize that value as an operating expense over the vesting period of the stock option 
share based compensation expense in is attributable to scheduled amortization of deferred share based compensation and accelerated vesting of stock options related to employee severance pay 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in as a result of costs related to adding personnel in support of our operations 

table of contents investment income  net investment income  net in thousands annual percentage change total investment income increased to million in from and increased to million in from in  the increase was primarily due to increasing average interest yields and additional interest income received from investing the net proceeds of approximately million from our follow on public offerings of common stock that were completed in april and may investment income during reflects realized losses of  following an investment decision made during the second quarter of to rebalance the portfolio away from mortgage backed securities in an effort to improve the overall yield of the portfolio 
in  the increase was primarily due to increasing average interest yields 
we expect investment income to increase in reflecting the higher level of invested funds resulting from payments received from genentech pursuant to the sgn collaboration 
non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend in thousands total non cash accretion of preferred stock deemed dividend was million in in connection with our series a convertible preferred stock financing in july  we recorded a beneficial conversion feature on the preferred stock 
the beneficial conversion feature has been treated as a preferred stock deemed dividend  which resulted in an increase to reported net loss in arriving at net loss attributable to common stockholders 
the non cash accretion of the preferred stock deemed dividend was recorded using the effective interest method through the date of earliest conversion in july and therefore affected only and non cash accretion charges did not have an effect on net loss or cash flows for the applicable reporting periods or have an impact on total stockholders equity as of the applicable reporting dates 
liquidity and capital resources december  liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investment securities working capital stockholders equity year ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities we have financed the substantial majority of our operations through the public and private sale of equity securities  which is supplemented by funding received from our collaboration and license agreements 
during we received approximately million through the sale of our common stock and approximately million in fees and milestone payments under our collaboration and license agreements 
to a lesser degree  
table of contents we have also financed our operations through interest earned on cash and cash equivalents 
these financing sources have historically allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and investment securities were million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in was primarily the result of net proceeds of million from our common stock financings in the second quarter  offset by million used to finance our operations 
our working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  the increase in working capital during reflects the proceeds from our common stock financings as well as changes in the composition of our investment portfolio 
we have structured our investment portfolio so that scheduled maturities of investment securities can be used to fund our working capital needs 
as of december   most of our investment portfolio was invested in short term securities in recognition of market yields 
our cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments  consisting of us government and agency securities  high grade us corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  commercial paper and money market accounts 
capital expenditures of million in and million in consisted primarily of lab equipment and computers and related information systems in support of our research and development activities and in support of employee growth 
capital expenditures of million in consisted of leasehold improvements  lab equipment  furniture and fixtures  primarily in connection with the expansion of our existing headquarters and operations facility for lab and office expansion which was completed during august we expect that our capital expenditures will increase compared to reflecting higher capital purchases and facilities improvements 
at our currently planned spending rate  we believe our remaining financial resources in addition to the expected fees and milestone payments earned under new and existing collaboration and license agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next several years 
we expect that our operating activities will generate to million of cash in however  changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner  such as increased manufacturing and clinical trial expenses preceding commercialization of a product candidate 
further  this estimate is based on the assumption that successful progress is made pursuant to our collaboration with genentech resulting in the receipt of payments and milestones 
while we do not foresee the need to raise additional capital in the short term  our long term needs may cause us to seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements  or public or private equity financings 
we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to raise additional funds should we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs  which may adversely affect our business and operations 
we expect to incur substantial costs as we continue to develop and commercialize our product candidates 
we anticipate that our rate of overall spending will accelerate as a result of the increased costs and expenses associated with adding personnel  clinical trials  regulatory filings  manufacturing  and research and development activities 
however  we may experience fluctuations in incurring these costs from quarter to quarter based on the timing of manufacturing campaigns  accrual of patients to clinical trials and collaborative activities 
certain external factors may influence our cash spending including the cost of filing and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments and the progress of our collaborators 
in  we expect our revenues to range from million to million  which reflects the earned portion of the upfront payment and estimated milestones and funded research payments expected to be received from genentech  as well as revenues earned under our existing adc collaborations 
in total  across all of our collaborations  we expect to receive between and million in cash during  the majority of which will be under our sgn license agreement 
in  we expect our operating expenses to range from million to million with increases over levels driven primarily by manufacturing campaigns for sgn in preparation for phase ii clinical trials  
table of contents costs associated with continued expansion and acceleration of our clinical programs particularly sgn and sgn  and increases in headcount and employee costs  led by growth in our clinical development team 
we expect that expenses will include our non cash expenses projected to be in the to million range 
of this amount  stock based compensation expense is expected to be in the range of to million 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions  including future stock prices and the number and timing of option grants  and is therefore subject to change 
we expect operating expenses to be relatively consistent quarter over quarter  although the timing of certain activities  such as manufacturing campaigns  the rate of clinical trial accruals and the speed at which we can hire new employees is variable and subject to change 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to comprise approximately percent of our total expenses 
some of our manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods  as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and the payment of royalties based on commercial product sales 
we do not expect to pay any royalties on net sales of products under any of these agreements for at least the next several years 
the amounts set forth below could be substantially higher if we are required to make milestone payments or if we receive regulatory approvals or achieve commercial sales and are required to pay royalties earlier than anticipated 
the following are our future minimum contractual commitments for the periods subsequent to december  in thousands total thereafter operating leases manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements lab equipment total the minimum payments under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements in primarily represent contractual obligations related to manufacturing campaigns to perform scale up and cgmp manufacturing for monoclonal antibody and adc product candidates for use in our clinical trials  including our contract manufacturing agreement with laureate pharma 
the above table excludes royalties and up to approximately million in potential future milestone payments to third parties under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements for our current development programs  which generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  such contingent payments have not been included in the above table 
as part of the terms of our office and laboratory lease  we have collateralized certain obligations under the lease with approximately  of our investments and the majority of our property and equipment 
these investment securities are restricted as to withdrawal and are managed by a third party 
in the event that we fail to meet specific thresholds of market capitalization  stockholders equity or cash and investment balances  we are obligated to increase our restricted investment balance to approximately million 
at december   we were in compliance with these thresholds 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in accordance with our policy  we do not have any derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in high quality interest bearing instruments  consisting of us government and agency securities  high grade us corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  adjustable mortgage backed securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
such securities are subject to interest rate risk and will rise and fall in value if market interest rates change  however  we do not expect any material loss from such interest rate changes
