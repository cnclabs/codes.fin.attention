developments pursuant to a concrete tie supply agreement with the union pacific railroad  we received permit approvals in january necessary to construct a new manufacturing facility in tucson  az 
despite additional delays due to production permitting and other operational issues  the facility has completed its commissioning phase and is producing ties at approximately of capacity 
in february  the company sold substantially all of the assets of its geotechnical division for million plus the net asset value of the fixed assets  inventory  work in progress and prepaid items  resulting in a gain of approximately million 
the results of the division have been reclassified as discontinued operations and prior periods have been reclassified to conform with this presentation 
future expenses are expected to be immaterial 
in february  after reviewing public comments on the supplemental environmental impact statement seis on the dm e project project  the surface transportation board stb granted its final approval for the project 
several opponents to the project have appealed the stb s final decision to the th us circuit court of appeals 
the th us circuit court of appeals upheld the final decision of the stb to grant final approval for the dm e project on december  we maintain a significant investment in the dm e railroad 
please see dakota  minnesota eastern railroad in this md a for additional information 
in november  we purchased a  square foot facility in pueblo  co 
we are using this site to increase production capacity for our rail products businesses 
we manufacture insulated rail joints  which were previously outsourced to an exclusive supplier  and assemble lubricators at the new facility 
although minor delays were experienced in  production has commenced and the facility can produce volumes originally anticipated 
certain of our businesses  especially our fabricated products group  have been hampered with low volumes and margins in and while we experienced significant improvement in  the backlog for this business remains weak 

table of contents recent developments on january   the federal railroad administration fra announced that it had determined that the dm e project had met the requirements of the federal environmental review process 
the release of the fra s final environmental review  known as a record of decision  marked the start of a day clock within which the agency had to approve or disapprove the dm e loan application 
on february   the fra announced that it had denied the dm e s loan application for the project due to the fra s opinion that there was an unacceptable degree of risk concerning the dm e s ability to repay the loan 
as a result of the fra s loan application rejection  the ultimate outcome of the project is uncertain 
we believe the dm e will review various alternatives including financing the project privately as well as other possible options 
in february  the company entered into the third amendment to the amended and restated credit agreement with a syndicate of three banks 
under this amendment  borrowings placed in libor contracts will be priced at prevailing libor rates  plus 
borrowings placed in other tranches will be priced at the prevailing prime rate minus 
the amendment permits the company to use various additional debt instruments to finance capital expenditures  outside of borrowings under the agreement  limited to an additional million 
the amendment also increased the company s permitted annual capital expenditures to million 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstance 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period  because it requires management to make assumptions about the existence of impairment indicators and cash flows over future years 
these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment  which would have an impact on the income statement 
goodwill and other intangible assets the company follows sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas whereby goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life are subject to annual impairment tests 
the impairment testing is a two step process 
the first step  which is used to identify potential impairment only  compares the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with its carrying value 
since quoted market prices are not readily available for the company s reporting units  the company estimates fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill is not considered to be impaired and the second step of the process is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step of the impairment testing must be performed to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
step two requires a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill 
the resulting fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
if the implied fair value of the goodwill is lower than the carrying value of goodwill  impairment must be recorded 

table of contents the company believes that the accounting estimates used in this testing are critical accounting estimates because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period affecting the fair value calculation which may have a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions require significant judgments related to anticipated revenues  and other internal and external economic conditions such as growth rate  discount rate and inflation 
at december  and  the goodwill on the company s balance sheet was million 
allowance for bad debts the company s operating segments encounter risks associated with the collection of accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company reviews its accounts receivable aging and calculates an allowance through application of historic reserve factors to overdue receivables 
this calculation is supplemented by specific account reviews performed by the company s credit department 
as necessary  the application of the company s allowance rates to specific customers is reviewed and adjusted to more accurately reflect the credit risk inherent within that customer relationship 
the reserve is reviewed on a monthly basis 
an account receivable is written off against the allowance when management determines it is uncollectible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for bad debts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
specific customer circumstances and general economic conditions may vary significantly from management s assumptions and may impact expected earnings 
at december  and  the company maintained an allowance for bad debts of million and million  respectively 
investment in the dakota  minnesota eastern railroad the company holds investments in the stock of the dakota  minnesota eastern railroad corporation dm e  which is recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet at its historical cost of million at december  this investment is comprised of common stock  series b preferred stock and common stock warrants  series c preferred stock and common stock warrants  series c preferred stock and common stock warrants  and series d preferred stock and common stock warrants 
the company also has a receivable for accrued dividend income on these issuances of million at december  the company  based on its own estimate of future cash flows  is recording only a portion of the amount due on all preferred series given the delay in anticipated realization of the receivable and the priority of redemption of the various issuances 
at december  and  the unrecorded dividends were approximately million and million  respectively 
the company will only recognize this income upon redemption of the respective issuances  or payment of the dividends 
the company considers the value of its investment in the dm e to be a critical estimate because the market value of the dm e stock is not readily determinable 
the company has based much of its assessment on information provided by the dm e and is not able to independently verify such information  as the dm e is a privately held entity 
management believes  however  the fair value of this investment exceeds its carrying amount 
product liability the company maintains a current liability for the repair or replacement of defective products 
for certain manufactured products  an accrual is made on a monthly basis as a percentage of cost of sales 
for long term construction products  a liability is established when the claim is known and quantifiable 
the product liability accrual is periodically adjusted based on the identification or resolution of known individual product liability claims 
the company believes that this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used to calculate the liability can change from period to period 
at december  and  the product liability was million and million  respectively 
slow moving inventory the company maintains reserves for slow moving inventory 
these reserves  which are reviewed and adjusted routinely  take into account numerous factors such as quantities on hand versus turnover  product knowledge  and physical inventory observations 
the company believes this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used in calculating the reserve can change from period to 
table of contents period and could have a material impact on the income statement 
at december  and  the reserve for slow moving inventory was million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition on long term contracts revenues from long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
for certain products  the percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of actual direct labor costs to estimated total direct labor costs 
as certain contracts extend over one or more years  revisions to estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
historically  the company s estimates of total costs and costs to complete have reasonably approximated actual costs incurred to complete contracts 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized in the financial statements 
the company estimates the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs on its long term contracts 
the company believes these estimates are critical accounting estimates because they require the use of judgments due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process 
as a result  actual revenues and profits could differ materially from estimates 
pension plans the calculation of the company s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in a different pension expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ significantly from the assumptions 
the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
the expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the plan s investment mix and the forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company for and was 
pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases 
the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
in estimating that rate  sfas requires that the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the company s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced 
therefore  the decline in the assumed discount rate has the effect of increasing the company s pension obligation and future pension expense 
the assumed discount rate used by the company was for and on december   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas 
sfas required the company to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit plans in the consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the adjustment to accumulated comprehensive income at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses  unrecognized prior service costs  and unrecognized transition assets remaining from the initial adoption of sfas deferred tax assets the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make judgments regarding the future realization of these assets 
as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  valuation allowances must be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not a likelihood more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
sfas requires management to evaluate positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
determination of whether the positive evidence outweighs the negative and quantification of the valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and judgments of future financial results 
the company believes that these estimates and judgments are critical accounting estimates 

table of contents see note  income taxes 
the company s ability to realize these tax benefits may affect the company s reported income tax expense benefit and net income loss 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation applies to all open tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas this interpretation is intended to result in increased relevance and comparability in financial reporting of income taxes and to provide more information about the uncertainty in income tax assets and liabilities 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the adoption of this interpretation is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas an amendment of sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions and sfas no 
r  employers disclosures about pensions and other postretirement benefits an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and sfas requires plan sponsors of defined benefit pension plans to recognize the funded status of their pension plans in the statement of financial position  measure the fair value of plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the fiscal year end statement of financial position  and provide additional disclosures 
on december   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas the effect of adopting sfas on the company s financial condition at december  has been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
sfas did not have an effect on the company s consolidated financial position at december  or  respectively 
sfas s provisions regarding the change in measurement date of pension plans are not applicable as the company already uses a measurement date of december for its pension plans 
see note  retirement plans  for further discussion of the effect of adopting sfas on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements  rather it applies under existing accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations

dakota  minnesota eastern railroad the company maintains a significant investment in the dakota  minnesota eastern railroad corporation dm e  a privately held  regional railroad  which controls over  miles of track in eight states 
at december   the company s investment was comprised of million of dm e common stock  million of series b preferred stock and warrants  million of series c preferred stock and warrants  million of preferred series c stock and warrants  and million of series d preferred stock and warrants 
in addition  the company has a receivable  recorded within investments on the company s consolidated balance sheet  for accrued dividend income on preferred stock of approximately million 
the company owns  including the company s warrants  approximately of the dm e s common stock  on a diluted basis 
in december  in conjunction with the issuance of series c preferred stock and warrants  the dm e ceased paying dividends on the series b shares 
the terms of the series b preferred stock state in the event that regular dividends are not paid timely  dividends accrue at an accelerated rate until those dividends are paid 
in addition  penalty interest accrues and compounds annually until such dividends are paid 
subsequent issuances of series c  c  and d preferred stock have all assumed distribution priority over the previous series  with series d not redeemable until as subsequent preferred series were issued  the company  based on its own valuation estimate  stopped recording the full amount due on all preferred series given the delay in anticipated realization of the asset and the priority of redemption of the various issuances 
the amount of dividend income not recorded was 
table of contents approximately million at december  the company will only recognize this income upon redemption of the respective issuances or payment of the dividends 
in june  the dm e announced its plan to build an extension from the dm e s existing line into the low sulfur coal market of the powder river basin in wyoming and to rebuild approximately miles of its existing track project 
the estimated cost of this project is expected to be in excess of billion 
the stb approved the project in january in october  however  the th us circuit court of appeals remanded the matter to the stb and instructed the stb to address  in its environmental impact statement  the project s effects on air quality  noise and vibration  and preservation of historic sites 
on january   the th us circuit court of appeals denied petitions seeking a rehearing of the case 
on april   the stb issued a draft seis on the project 
on february   after reviewing public comments on the seis  the stb made its final decision  approving the project 
in april  several opponents to the project appealed the stb s final decision to the th us circuit court of appeals 
on december   the th us circuit court of appeals upheld the stb s decision to grant final approval for the project 
in december  the dm e received a railroad rehabilitation and improvement financing rrif loan in the amount of million from the federal railroad administration 
funding provided by the year loan was used to refinance debt and upgrade infrastructure along parts of its existing route 
in november   the dm e announced that it has applied to the federal railroad administration fra for a rrif loan totaling approximately billion to build and or rehabilitate approximately  miles of railroad in four states 
the loan package is intended to fund four separate projects  including a mile project which encompasses the project 
various groups have indicated their opposition to the dm e s application for this fra loan 
on january   the fra announced that it had determined that the project had met the requirements of the federal environmental review process 
the release of the fra s final environmental review  known as a record of decision  marks the start of a day clock within which the agency must approve or disapprove the dm e loan application 
on february   the fra announced that it had denied the dm e s loan application for the project due to the fra s opinion that there was an unacceptable degree of risk concerning the dm e s ability to repay the loan 
as a result of the fra s loan application rejection  the ultimate outcome of the project is uncertain 
we believe the dm e will review various alternatives including financing the project privately as well as other possible options 
if the project proves to be viable  management believes that the value of the company s investment in the dm e will increase significantly 
however  if the project does not come to fruition  management believes that the value of the company s investment is still significantly more than the million carried on the company s balance sheet 
outlook cxt rail and arp are dependent on the union pacific railroad uprr for a significant portion of their business 
subsequent to the january execution of a concrete tie supply agreement with uprr  we installed new tie manufacturing equipment at our grand island  ne facility and commenced production of concrete ties in september during the fourth quarter of  the facility produced more concrete railroad ties over the prior year period when we were running older equipment at maximum capacity 
the uprr has agreed to purchase ties from the grand island facility through december in addition to upgrading the grand island facility  we have completed a new concrete railroad tie manufacturing facility in tucson  az 
despite construction delays attributable to permitting and other operational issues  the facility has completed commissioning and has begun tie production
