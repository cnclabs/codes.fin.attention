item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes many forward looking statements 
for cautions about relying on such forward looking statements  please refer to the section entitled forward looking statements at the beginning of this report immediately prior to item general we develop  manufacture and market high performance infrastructure products for wireless voice and data applications 
wireless carriers face many challenges in today s competitive marketplace 
minutes of use are skyrocketing  and wireless users now expect the same quality of service from their mobile devices as from their landline phones 
we help wireless carriers meet these challenges by doing more with less 
our products help maximize the performance of wireless telecommunications networks by improving the quality of uplink signals from mobile wireless devices 
our products increase capacity utilization  lower dropped and blocked calls  extend coverage  and enable higher wireless data throughput all while reducing capital and operating costs 
superlink incorporates patented high temperature superconductor hts technology to create a receiver front end that enhances network performance 
today  we are leveraging our expertise and proprietary technology in radio frequency rf engineering to expand our product line beyond hts technology 
we believe our rf engineering expertise provides us with a significant competitive advantage in the development of high performance  cost effective solutions for the front end of wireless telecommunications networks 
we have three product offerings superlink 
in order to receive uplink signals from wireless handsets  base stations require a wireless filter system to eliminate out of band interference 
superlink combines hts filters with a proprietary cryogenic cooler and an ultra low noise amplifier 
the result is a highly compact and reliable receiver front end that can simultaneously deliver both high selectivity interference rejection and high sensitivity detection of low level signals 
superlink delivers significant performance advantages over conventional filter systems 
amplink 
amplink is designed to address the sensitivity requirements of wireless base stations 
amplink is a ground mounted unit which utilizes a high performance amplifier 
the enhanced uplink performance provided by amplink improves network coverage immediately and avoids the installation and maintenance costs associated with tower mounted alternatives 
superplex 
superplex is our line of multiplexers that provides extremely low insertion loss and excellent cross band isolation 
superplex high performance multiplexers are designed to eliminate the need for additional base station antennas and reduce infrastructure costs 
relative to competing technologies  these products offer increased transmit power delivered to the base station antenna  higher sensitivity to subscriber handset signals  and fast and cost effective network overlays 
we currently sell most of our commercial products directly to wireless network operators in the united states 
our customers to date include alltel  cingular  sprint nextel  t mobile  us cellular and verizon wireless 
we have a concentrated customer base 
verizon wireless  alltel and t mobile each accounted for more than of our commercial revenues in and we plan to expand our customer base by selling directly to other wireless network operators and manufacturers of base station equipment  but we cannot assure that this effort will be successful 
we also generate significant revenues from government contracts 
we primarily pursue government research and development contracts which compliment our commercial product development 
we undertake government contract work which has the potential to improve our commercial product offering 
these contracts often yield valuable intellectual property relevant to our commercial business 
we typically own the intellectual property developed under these contracts  and the federal government receives a royalty free  non exclusive and nontransferable license to use the intellectual property for the united states 

table of contents we sell most of our products to a small number of wireless carriers  and their demand for wireless communications equipment fluctuates dramatically and unpredictably 
we expect these trends to continue and may cause significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenues 
the wireless communications infrastructure equipment market is extremely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence  evolving industry standards and price erosion over the life of a product 
we face constant pressures to reduce prices 
consequently  we expect the average selling prices of our products will continue decreasing over time 
we have responded in the past by successfully reducing our product costs  and expect further cost reductions over the next twelve months 
however  we cannot predict whether our costs will decline at a rate sufficient to keep pace with the competitive pricing pressures 
recent developments settlement of shalvoy litigation on march   we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release of all claims with charles shalvoy  a director and shareholder 
the agreement settles a lawsuit we filed against mr 
shalvoy in december to collect payment of amounts due under two promissory notes executed by mr 
shalvoy in connection with his exercise of two options to purchase common stock of conductus  inc prior to our acquisition of conductus 
the agreement provides for a payment of  to us on or before april  in payment of one note  including interest and attorneys fees  and the rescission of mr 
shalvoy s second purported option exercise including cancellation of the related note 
see item legal proceedings settlement of shalvoy litigation 
change of independent registered public accounting firm on october   we changed our independent registered public accounting firm from pricewaterhousecoopers llp to stonefield josephson  inc our audit committee made the decision to change independent registered public accounting firms  and the decision was ratified by the executive committee of our board of directors 
stonefield josephson  inc was engaged as our independent registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending december   and to perform procedures related to the financial statements included in our quarterly reports on form q  beginning with  and including  the quarter ended september  in deciding to select sji  the audit committee considered the firm s experience and expertise with publicly traded technology companies and reviewed auditor independence issues 
the audit committee concluded that sji has no commercial relationship that would impair its independence and has the appropriate expertise required to audit our current operations 
cingular master supplier agreement on september   we entered into a master supplier agreement msa with cingular wireless llc 
the agreement has a term of years and allows cingular wireless  its affiliates and regions to purchase any of our products at the prices  and on the terms  specified in the msa 
the msa does not contain any minimum purchase commitment  but its execution gives each cingular region direct access to our full product line 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continually evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  recovery of long lived assets  income taxes  warranty obligations  contract revenue and contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any future changes to these estimates and assumptions could cause a 
table of contents material change to our reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
our inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record  on a quarterly basis  a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments 
if the results of the review determine that a write down is necessary  the company recognizes a loss in the period in which the loss is identified  whether or not the inventory is retained or disposed 
our inventory reserves establish a new cost basis for inventory and are not reversed until the related inventory is sold or otherwise disposed 
such provisions are established based on historical usage  adjusted for known changes in demands for such products  or the estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
our business is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
demand for our products can fluctuate significantly 
our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate and we may understate or overstate the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
our net sales consist of revenue from sales of products net of trade discounts and allowances 
we recognize revenue when evidence of an arrangement exists  contractual obligations have been satisfied  title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
at the time revenue is recognized  we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties if allowed for under contractual arrangements and return products 
our warranty obligation is effected by product failure rates and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should such failure rates or costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted 
we indemnify  without limit or term  our customers against all claims  suits  demands  damages  liabilities  expenses  judgments  settlements and penalties arising from actual or alleged infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual property relating to our products or other claims arising from our products 
we cannot reasonably develop an estimate of the maximum potential amount of payments that might be made under our guarantees because of the uncertainty as to whether a claim might arise and how much it might total 
contract revenues are principally generated under research and development contracts 
contract revenues are recognized utilizing the percentage of completion method measured by the relationship of costs incurred to total estimated contract costs 
if the current contract estimate were to indicate a loss  utilizing the funded amount of the contract  a provision would be made for the total anticipated loss 
contract revenues are derived primarily from research contracts with agencies of the united states government 
credit risk related to accounts receivable arising from such contracts is considered minimal 
these contracts include cost plus  fixed price and cost sharing arrangements and are generally short term in nature 
all payments to us for work performed on contracts with agencies of the us government are subject to adjustment upon audit by the defense contract audit agency 
based on historical experience and review of current projects in process  we believe that the audits will not have a significant effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the defense contract audit agency has audited us through in connection with the acquisition of conductus we recognized million of goodwill 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter after the annual planning process  or earlier if events occur which require an impairment analysis to be performed 
we operate in a single business segment as a single reporting unit 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value based on market 
table of contents capitalization of the entire organization with the book value of its net assets  including goodwill 
our market capitalization is based the closing price of our common stock as traded on nasdaq multiplied by our outstanding common shares 
if the fair value of our company exceeds the book value of our net assets  our goodwill is not considered impaired 
if the book value of our net assets exceeds our fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test shall be performed to measure the amount of impairment loss 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test  used to measure the amount of impairment loss  compares the implied fair value of the goodwill with the book value of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
at july   the company s market capitalization had declined to million  an amount less than the total book value of the company 
we concluded that our declining stock price constituted an event under fas and required us to test for goodwill impairment as of july  we then proceeded with step two of the impairment analysis determining the fair values of all the tangible and intangible assets of the company and then aggregating and subtracting these values from the fair value of the company 
our analysis was not complete at the time we filed our quarterly report for the second quarter  but our preliminary analysis led us to reasonably estimate at that time that the company s fair market value was less than its net assets excluding goodwill 
accordingly  we recorded a full write down of the goodwill million in the second quarter 
we completed this exercise in the third quarter and confirmed that an impairment loss had occurred 
our final analysis confirmed that the company s fair market value at july was less than its net assets excluding goodwill 
we periodically evaluate the realizability of long lived assets as events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to recover the carrying amount 
long lived assets that will no longer be used in business are written off in the period identified since they will no longer generate any positive cash flows for the company 
periodically  long lived assets that will continue to be used by the company need to be evaluated for recoverability 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including cash flow and profitability projections 
the analyses necessarily involve significant management judgment 
in the event the projected undiscounted cash flows are less than net book value of the assets  the carrying value of the assets will be written down to their estimated fair value 
our future cash flows may vary from estimates 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no

under this provision  the share based compensation cost recognized beginning january  includes compensation cost for i all share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value originally estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

we accounted for equity securities issued to non employees in accordance with the provision of sfas and emerging issues task force prior to  we did not recognize compensation expense for issuance of stock options to employees 
if we had elected to recognize compensation expense for employee awards prior to based upon the fair value at the

for this purpose  the compensation committee defined out of the money options as options having an exercise price equal to or greater than per share the market price on the date of the committee s decision to accelerate the vesting 
if the company had elected to recognize compensation expense for employee awards  the pro forma cost impact of these accelerated options in would have been m 
our valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets is based on our assessments of historical losses and projected operating results in future periods 
if and when we generate future taxable income in the us against which these tax assets may be applied  some portion or all of the valuation allowance would be reversed and an increase in net income would consequently be reported in future years 
we have a contract to deliver several custom products to a government contractor 
we are unable to manufacture the products for technical reasons 
we have discussed the problem with the contractor and its government customer 
they are considering the problem  and we expect further discussions 
we do not believe that a loss is reasonably estimable at this time and therefore have not recorded any liability relating to this matter 
we will periodically reassess our potential liability as additional information becomes available 
if we later determine that a loss is probable and the amount reasonably estimable  we would record a liability for the potential loss 
backlog our commercial backlog consists of accepted product purchase orders with scheduled delivery dates during the next twelve months 
we had commercial backlog of  at december   as compared to  at december  results of operations compared to net revenues decreased by million  or  from million in to million in net revenues consist primarily of commercial product revenues and government contract revenues 
we also generate some additional revenues from sublicensing our technology 
net commercial product revenues decreased by million  or  to million in from million in the decrease is primarily the result of lower sales and lower average sale prices of our products 
our three largest customers accounted for of our net commercial revenues in  as compared to in these customers generally purchase products through non binding commitments with minimal lead 
table of contents times 
consequently  our commercial product revenues can fluctuate dramatically from quarter to quarter based on changes in our customers capital spending patterns 
government contract revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
million  or 
this increase is primarily attributable to the addition of new or amended contracts in cost of commercial product revenues includes all direct costs  manufacturing overhead  provision for excess and obsolete inventories 
the cost of commercial product revenues totaled million for as compared to million for  a decrease of million  or 
the lower costs resulted from no restructuring expenses in and a lower provision for obsolete inventory 
restructuring and impairment expenses from severance and fixed assets write off included in cost of goods sold were zero in as compared to  in our provision for obsolete inventories totaled  in as compared to million in our cost of sales includes both variable and fixed cost components 
the variable component consists primarily of materials  assembly and test labor  overhead  which includes equipment and facility depreciation  transportation costs and warranty costs 
the fixed component includes test equipment and facility depreciation  purchasing and procurement expenses and quality assurance costs 
given the fixed nature of such costs  the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory decreases and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales increases as production volumes decline since we have fewer units to absorb our overhead costs against 
conversely  the absorption of our production overhead costs into inventory increases and the amount of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales decreases as production volumes increase since we have more units to absorb our overhead costs against 
as a result  our gross profit margins generally decrease as revenue and production volumes decline due to lower sales volume and higher amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales  and our gross profit margins generally increase as our revenue and production volumes increase due to higher sales volume and lower amounts of production overhead variances expensed to cost of sales 
our inventory is valued at the lower of its actual cost or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we review inventory quantities on hand and on order and record  on a quarterly basis  a provision for excess and obsolete inventory and or vendor cancellation charges related to purchase commitments 
if the results of the review determine that a write down is necessary  the company recognizes a loss in the period in which the loss is identified  whether or not the inventory is retained or disposed

we have effective registration statements on file with the sec covering the public resale by investors of all the common stock issued in our private placements  as well as any common stock acquired upon exercise of their warrants 
we have an existing line of credit from a bank 
it is a material source of funds for our business

advances bear interest at the prime rate at december  plus subject to a minimum monthly charge 
there was no amount outstanding under this borrowing facility at december  advances are collateralized by a lien on all of our assets 
under the terms of the agreement  we continue to service the sold receivables and are subject to recourse provisions 
we completed one financing transaction in and none in in august  we raised net proceeds of million in a registered direct public sale of  shares of common stock at per share and year warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock exercisable at per share 
the warrants became exercisable on february  the warrant agreement also contains the following significant terms i in the event of changes in the outstanding common stock of the company  the number of shares and their price under the warrant shall be correspondingly adjusted and ii if  at any time while the warrants are outstanding  the company issues additional shares at an effective price less than the warrant price the number of shares and their price will be adjusted 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we incur various contractual obligations and commercial commitments in our normal course of business 
they consist of the following capital lease obligations our capital lease obligations are for property and equipment and total operating lease obligations 
table of contents our operating lease obligations consist of a facility lease in santa barbara  california and several copier leases 
patents and licenses we have entered into various licensing agreements requiring royalty payments ranging from to of specified product sales 
some of these agreements contain provisions for the payment of guaranteed or minimum royalty amounts 
typically  the licensor can terminate our license if we fail to pay minimum annual royalties 
purchase commitments in the normal course of business  we incur purchase obligations with vendors and suppliers for the purchase of inventory  as well as other goods and services 
these obligations are generally evidenced by purchase orders that contain the terms and conditions associated with the purchase arrangements 
we are committed to accept delivery of such material pursuant to the purchase orders subject to various contract provisions which allow us to delay receipt of such orders or cancel orders beyond certain agreed upon lead times 
cancellations may result in cancellation costs payable by us 
quantitative summary of contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december   we had the following contractual obligations and commercial commitments payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years capital lease obligations operating leases minimum license commitment fixed asset and inventory purchase commitments total contractual cash obligations capital expenditures we plan to invest approximately  in fixed assets during future liquidity our principal sources of liquidity consist of existing cash balances and funds expected to be generated from future operations 
based on our current forecasts  our cash resources may not be sufficient to fund our planned operations for the remainder of we believe one of the key factors to our liquidity in will be our ability to successfully execute on our plans to increase sales levels 
our cash requirements will also depend on numerous other variable factors  including the rate of growth of sales  the timing and levels of products purchased  payment terms and credit limits from manufacturers  and the timing and level of accounts receivable collections 
because of the uncertainty of these many factors  the company intends to raise funds in the next six months to meet its working capital needs 
we cannot assure you that additional financing public or private will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we issue additional equity securities to raise funds  the ownership percentage of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
new investors may demand rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of common stock 
if we cannot raise any needed funds  we might be forced to make further substantial reductions in our operating expenses  which could adversely affect our ability to implement our current business plan and ultimately our viability as a company 
our financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern 
in  we incurred a net loss of million and had negative cash flows from operations of million 
our independent registered public accounting firm has included in their audit report for fiscal an explanatory paragraph expressing doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
they included a similar explanatory 
table of contents paragraph in their audit report for the factors described above raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
our financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from this uncertainty 
in response to these issues  we reduced direct and indirect labor and continued to cut fixed costs 
we also consolidated our sunnyvale operations into our santa barbara facility and accelerated the reduction of our production costs 
we have also taken several steps to increase our commercial sales 
we have introduced new products and are aggressively taking steps to add new customers 
net operating loss carryforward as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which expire in the years through of these amounts million and million  respectively resulted from the acquisition of conductus 
included in the net operating loss carryforwards are deductions related to stock options of approximately million and million for federal and california income tax purposes  respectively 
to the extent net operating loss carryforwards are recognized for accounting purposes the resulting benefits related to the stock options will be credited to stockholders equity 
in addition  we have research and development and other tax credits for federal and state income tax purposes of approximately million and  respectively  which expire in the years through of these amounts  and  respectively resulted from the acquisition of conductus 
due to the uncertainty surrounding their realization  we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
accordingly  no deferred tax asset has been recorded in the accompanying balance sheet 
section of the internal revenue code imposes an annual limitation on the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards based on a statutory rate of return usually the applicable federal funds rate  as defined in the internal revenue code and the value of the corporation at the time of a change of ownership as defined by section we completed an analysis of our equity transactions and determined that we had a change in ownership in august and december therefore  the ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards incurred prior to the change of ownership totaling million will be subject in future periods to an annual limitation of million 
in addition  we acquired the right to conductus net operating losses  which are also subject to the limitations imposed by section conductus underwent three ownership changes  which occurred in february  february and december therefore  the ability to utilize conductus net operating loss carryforwards of million incurred prior to the ownership changes will be subject in future periods to annual limitation of  net operating losses incurred by us subsequent to the ownership changes totaled million and are not subject to this limitation
