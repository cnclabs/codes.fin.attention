overview gasco is a natural gas and petroleum exploitation  development and production company engaged in locating and developing hydrocarbon prospects  primarily in the rocky mountain region 
the company s business strategy is to enhance shareholder value by using technologies new to a specific area to generate and develop high potential exploitation resources in this area 
the company s principal business is the acquisition of leasehold interests in petroleum and natural gas rights  either directly or indirectly  and the exploitation and development of properties subject to those leases 
the company s corporate strategy is to grow through drilling projects 
the company has been focusing its drilling efforts in the riverbend project located in the uinta basin of northeastern utah 
the higher oil and gas prices during and through the first quarter of due to factors such as inventory levels of gas in storage  extreme weather in parts of the country and increasing demand in the united states  combined with the continued instability in the middle east resulted in increased drilling activity in the riverbend area 
the increased drilling activity in the area decreased the availability of drilling rigs and experienced personnel in this area and may continue to do so in the future 
the company also continues to incur higher drilling and operating costs resulting from the increased fuel and steel costs and from the increased drilling activity in this area 
recent developments drilling activity during the year ended december   the company spudded gross wells approximately net wells and reached total depth on gross wells approximately net wells in the riverbend area 
we also conducted initial completion operations on wells net wells and re entered wells net wells to complete pay zones that were behind pipe 
as of december   we operated gross wells with two additional wells awaiting completion activities 
we currently have three drilling rigs operating in the uinta basin riverbend project  and are expecting delivery of our fourth rig at the end of march during  gasco entered into a farmout agreement with an industry partner that drilled to earn acreage in our daniel anticline prospect in wyoming 
the agreement allows our industry partner to earn of our daniel anticline prospect to all depths 
we will retain operations of the wells in the project 
we have also established an area of mutual interest ami covering this prospect 
the ami will allow both parties to jointly test the productive potential in the core area and to later implement a plan of development 
under the terms of the farmout agreement  we paid of the well costs and earned of the first well which was a hilliard shale test 
the well was drilled to approximately  feet and was intended to test the natural gas potential in five formations 
although gas quantities were present  the well was determined to be uneconomic and was plugged during january gasco is also currently drilling a well in the muddy creek prospect in wyoming to test natural gas potential in five formations to a revised proposed depth of  feet 
intermediate casing was set at approximately  feet  and the rig has been released and drilling operations have been suspended due to winter lease stipulations 
drilling operations on this well are expected to resume in july the costs to drill and complete this well are estimated to be approximately  and gasco has a working interest 
during we entered into an agreement with a group of industry providers together  the service parties to accelerate the development of gasco s oil and gas properties by drilling up to wells in gasco s riverbend project in utah s uinta basin 
the development of this project typically occurred in increments of well bundles 
under this agreement  we drilled wells during  wells during and wells during in february  the service parties did not approve the fourth bundle as proposed by gasco 
as a result  gasco and the service parties are currently in discussions on a fourth bundle 
property impairment during  approximately  of unproved lease costs related primarily to expiring acreage in wyoming were reclassified to proved property 
we utilize the full cost method of accounting  under which capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion  net of deferred income taxes full cost pool may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves less the future cash outflows associated with the asset retirement obligations that have been accrued in the balance sheet plus the cost  or estimated fair value  if lower of unproved properties and the costs of any properties not being amortized  if any 
should the full cost pool exceed this ceiling  an impairment is recognized 
this impairment is recorded as non cash expense and is not permitted to be reversed in future periods in the event that oil and gas prices subsequently increase resulting in a higher ceiling 
the present value of estimated future net revenues is computed by applying current prices of oil and gas to estimated future production of proved oil and gas reserves as of period end  less estimated future expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved reserves assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions 
however  subsequent commodity price increases may be utilized to calculate the ceiling value 
as of december   based on oil and gas prices of per mcf and per barrel  the full cost pool would have exceeded the above described ceiling by  however  subsequent to year end  oil and gas prices increased  and using these prices  the company s full cost pool would not have exceeded the ceiling limitation 
as a result of the increase in the ceiling amount using subsequent prices  the company has not recorded an impairment of its oil and gas prices at december  as of june   the company s full cost pool exceeded the ceiling limitation based on oil and gas prices of per barrel and per mcf 
subsequent commodity price increases were not sufficient to eliminate the need for the impairment and therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the quarter ended june  acquisition gasco acquired certain gathering assets and producing properties associated with the riverbend project in the uinta basin of utah for a cash purchase price of  plus settlement for production from effective date 
the gathering assets and properties are located entirely within gasco s existing riverbend leasehold allowing the company to further capitalize on economies of scale and operating efficiencies 
the transaction closed on august   with an effective date of july  the company assigned a value of approximately  to the gathering assets  which include miles of to mainline gathering pipelines 
the acquired gathering assets should provide more timely and cost effective tie in of the existing wilkin ridge and west desert systems to gasco s riverbend gas processing facility 
gasco now controls nearly miles of mainline gathering and a mmcf d gas processing facility in the riverbend project 
this acquisition enabled gasco to connect its wilkin ridge and west desert gathering systems to its riverbend gas processing plant 
the gathering lines acquired in this transaction may be tied into these systems at an estimated cost of million  allowing the company to potentially realize a savings of million versus amounts previously budgeted 
also included in the acquisition are oil and gas wells producing thousand cubic feet equivalent per day mcfe d gross mcfe d net 
in the transaction  gasco acquired approximately billion cubic feet equivalent of proved reserves 
the acquisition has no effect on gross acreage leasehold positions and a negligible effect on net acreage leasehold totals 
a number of the wells are producing oil and associated gas from the shallow green river formation 
some of the existing well pads will lend themselves to also be used as locations for deeper spring canyon blackhawk wells which should yield savings on building a new drilling pad and access road of  to  per location 
other operations during  gasco completed the linking of the wilkin ridge and west desert gathering systems to its existing mmcfd gas processing facility which began operations in june now  up to of produced volumes are processed in the facility  ensuring that production will meet pipeline specifications reducing the likelihood of any future curtailments 
the company currently operates nearly miles of gathering system along with the processing facility 
gasco recently received approval of its riverbend environmental assessment ea 
the approved ea includes proposed wells within the spring canyon marine trend of the blackhawk formation 
the ea should provide for accelerated permitting approvals from the bureau of land management as the environmental and cultural studies of the proposed well sites have already been completed 
proposed acquisition on september   gasco entered into an agreement to purchase brek energy corporation brek for equity consideration of  shares of the company common stock valued at approximately  based on the closing price of gasco s stock on september  as a result of the acquisition  gasco will acquire approximately  net acres in the uinta basin of utah and approximately  net acres in the green river basin of wyoming 
the acquisition is expected to simplify gasco s acreage portfolio by absorbing a working interest partner that previously owned approximately of gasco s undeveloped acreage in utah and wyoming 
gasco does not expect to incur any additional overhead expenses as a result of the acquisition 
the boards of directors of both brek and gasco have each approved the terms of the transaction  which is expected to close during the second quarter of the completion of the transaction is subject to the approval of the stockholders of brek and the completion of a distribution of certain subsidiaries of brek to its stockholders 
under the terms of the transaction  a wholly owned subsidiary of gasco will merge with and into brek 
as a result of the merger  brek will become a wholly owned subsidiary of gasco and stockholders of brek in the aggregate will receive a number of shares of common stock of gasco equal to  divided by the total number of shares of common stock of brek outstanding on the date of the merger  calculated on a fully diluted basis 
gasco may issue additional shares of our common stock upon exercise of certain brek options and warrants that we intend to assume in connection with the brek acquisition 
as part of the transaction  the directors of brek  who collectively own approximately of brek s outstanding stock  have entered into an agreement to vote their shares in favor of the transaction 
in addition  brek s president and ceo  who owns approximately of the outstanding common stock of brek  has agreed to deposit  shares of gasco common stock acquired in the transaction in escrow to satisfy any claims with respect to breaches of representations and warranties of brek 
credit facility on march   gasco and certain of its subsidiaries  as guarantors  entered into a million credit agreement the credit agreement with jpmorgan chase bank  na  as administrative agent and the other lenders named therein 
borrowings made under the credit agreement are guaranteed by our subsidiaries and secured by a pledge of the capital stock of our subsidiaries and mortgages on substantially all of our oil and gas properties 
we have not borrowed any funds under the credit agreement since the time of its execution 
the initial aggregate commitment of the lenders under the credit agreement was  subject to a borrowing base which has initially set at  the borrowing base was subsequently increased to  during october the credit agreement also provides for a  sublimit for letters of credit which we may use for general corporate purposes 
as of december  there were no loans outstanding  however  a  letter of credit is considered usage  for purposes of calculating availability and commitment fees 
our aggregate borrowings and outstanding letters of credit under the credit agreement may not at any time exceed the borrowing base 
interest on borrowings is payable monthly and principal is due at maturity on march  interest on borrowings under the credit agreement accrues at variable interest rates at either  at our election  a eurodollar rate or an alternate base rate 
the eurodollar rate is calculated as libor plus an applicable margin that varies from for periods in which we have utilized less than of the borrowing base to for periods in which we have utilized greater than of the borrowing base 
the alternate base rate is calculated as the greater of a the prime rate or b the federal funds effective rate plus  plus an applicable margin that varies from for periods in which we have utilized less than of the borrowing base to for periods in which we have utilized greater than of the borrowing base 
we elect the basis of the interest rate at the time of each borrowing 
in addition  we are obligated to pay a commitment fee under the credit agreement quarterly in arrears based on a percentage multiplied by the daily amount that the aggregate commitments exceed borrowings under the agreement 
the commitment fee percentage varies from to based on the percentage of the borrowing base utilized 
the credit agreement requires us to comply with financial covenants that require us to maintain a current ratio defined as current assets plus unused availability under the credit facility divided by current liabilities excluding the current portion of the credit facility  determined at the end of each quarter  of not less than  and a ratio of senior debt to ebitdax as such terms are defined in the credit agreement for the most recent quarter multiplied by four not to be greater than for each fiscal quarter 
in addition  the credit agreement contains covenants that restrict our ability to incur other indebtedness  create liens or sell our assets  pay dividends on our common stock and make certain investments 
as of december   we were in compliance with each of the covenants contained in the credit facility 
the company incurred  in debt issuance costs associated with this facility 
these costs have been recorded as deferred financing costs in the accompanying financial statements and are being amortized over the four year term of the credit facility 
the credit facility is available to provide funds for the exploration  development and or acquisition of oil and gas properties  to refinance existing indebtedness and for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement provides for semi annual evaluation of the borrowing base  which will be determined as a percentage of the discounted present value of the company s oil and natural gas reserves

the majority of the revisions of previous estimates were a result of the following four locations previously classified as proved undeveloped were omitted from the reserve report because these locations required a higher capital investment than originally estimated due to drilling and completion problems and due to the lack of historical data related to recent completions and recompletions in this area 
six locations previously classified as proved undeveloped were omitted from the reserve report because recent drilling activity indicates that these locations may be outside of or on the edge of a previously identified zone 
two proved developed non producing completions significantly underperformed previous forecasts

the production increases in and were primarily due to drilling activity 
the company s investing activities during the three years ended december  related primarily to the company s development and exploration activities and the purchase of a drilling rig 
during  we also completed acquisitions of acreage and additional working interests in producing wells for approximately  we had sales proceeds of  during which represented the sale of acreage to an unrelated entity 
our sales proceeds during represented a disposition of net profits interests in wells in the riverbend area for  we also invested  in short term investments during and sold  and  of these investments during and  respectively 
the remaining investing activity during  and consisted primarily of changes in our restricted investments 
the company s financing activities during are comprised mainly of proceeds from the exercise of common stock options partially offset by cash paid for offering costs and preferred dividends 
the financing activities in and are primarily comprised of the net proceeds from the sale of equity and convertible notes in the company  as further described below 
on november   we closed a public offering of  shares of common stock at a price to the public of per share 
we also granted the underwriters a day option to purchase up to  additional shares of our common stock solely to cover over allotments

the program will primarily cover the drilling and completion of at least net wells on our riverbend project and the completion of the drilling of one in wyoming 
the budget also includes expenditures for the installation of associated pipeline infrastructure  distribution facilities and geophysical operations 
this budget will be funded primarily from cash on hand  cash flow from operations and borrowings under our line of credit 
management believes it has sufficient capital for its operational budget  but may need to raise additional capital for its capital budget in the company may consider several options for raising additional funds such as selling securities  selling assets or farm outs or similar type arrangements 
any financing obtained through the sale of gasco equity will likely result in substantial dilution to the company s stockholders

the above table does not include asset retirement obligations as discussed in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements  as the company cannot determine with accuracy the timing of such payments 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states requires management to make assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following is a summary of the significant accounting policies and related estimates that affect the company s financial disclosures 
oil and gas reserves gasco follows the full cost method of accounting whereby all costs related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties are capitalized into a single cost center referred to as a full cost pool 
depletion of exploration and development costs and depreciation of production equipment is computed using the units of production method based upon estimated proved oil and gas reserves 
under the full cost method of accounting  capitalized oil and gas property costs less accumulated depletion and net of deferred income taxes may not exceed an amount equal to the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and gas reserves less the future cash outflows associated with the asset retirement obligations that have been accrued on the balance sheet plus the cost  or estimated fair value if lower  of unproved properties 
should capitalized costs exceed this ceiling  an impairment would be recognized 
as of december   based on oil and gas prices of per mcf and per barrel  the full cost pool would have exceeded the above described ceiling by  however  subsequent to year end  oil and gas prices increased  and using these prices  the company s full cost pool would not have exceeded the ceiling limitation 
as a result of the increase in the ceiling amount using subsequent prices  the company has not recorded an impairment of its oil and gas prices at december  as of june   the company s full cost pool exceeded the ceiling limitation based on oil and gas prices of per barrel and per mcf 
subsequent commodity price increases were not sufficient to eliminate the need for the impairment and therefore  impairment expense of  was recorded during the quarter ended june  a change in the estimated value of the full cost ceiling as describe above  could have a material impact on the total of the impairment recorded by the company 
estimated reserve quantities and future net cash flows have the most significant impact on the company because these reserve estimates are used in providing a measure of the company s overall value 
these estimates are also used in the quarterly calculations of depletion  depreciation and impairment of the company s proved properties 
estimating accumulations of gas and oil is complex and is not exact because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in the process 
the process relies on interpretations of available geological  geophysical  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the securities and exchange commission sec  such as gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the most accurate method of determining proved reserve estimates is based upon a decline analysis method  which consists of extrapolating future reservoir pressure and production from historical pressure decline and production data 
the accuracy of the decline analysis method generally increases with the length of the production history 
since most of the company s wells have been producing less than six years  their production history is relatively short  so other generally less accurate methods such as volumetric analysis and analogy to the production history of wells of other operators in the same reservoir were used in conjunction with the decline analysis method to determine the company s estimates of proved reserves including developed producing  developed non producing and undeveloped 
as the company s wells are produced over time and more data is available  the estimated proved reserves will be redetermined on an annual basis and may be adjusted based on that data 
actual future production  gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from the company s estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the quantities and present value of the company s reserves 
for example a decrease in price of per mcf for natural gas and per barrel of oil would result in a decrease in the company s december  present value of future net cash flows of approximately  in addition  the company may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  acquisitions  divestitures  ownership interest revisions  results of exploration and development and prevailing gas and oil prices 
the company s reserves may also be susceptible to drainage by operators on adjacent properties 
impairment of long lived assets the cost of the company s unproved properties is withheld from the depletion base as described above  until such a time as the properties are either developed or abandoned 
these properties are reviewed periodically for possible impairment 
each quarter the company s management reviews all unproved property 
if a determination is made that acreage will be expiring or that the company does not plan to develop some of the acreage that is no longer considered to be prospective  the company records an impairment of the acreage and reclassifies the costs to the full cost pool 
the company estimates the value of these acres for the purpose of recording the related impairment 
the impairments that have been recorded by the company were estimated by calculating a per acre value from the total unproved costs incurred for the applicable acreage divided by the total net acres owned by the company 
this per acre estimate is then applied to the acres that the company does not plan to develop in order to calculate the impairment 
as a result of this process the company has recorded impairments of  and  during the years ended december  and  respectively 
these impairments related primarily to the costs of expiring acreage in wyoming 
a change in the estimated value of the acreage could have a material impact on the total of the impairment recorded by the company 
stock based compensation effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation which requires companies to recognize compensation cost for stock based awards based on the estimated fair value of the award 
compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the company uses the black scholes option valuation model to calculate the fair value disclosures under sfas r 
this model requires the company to estimate a risk free interest rate and the volatility of the company s common stock price 
the use of a different estimate for any one of these components could have a material impact on the amount of calculated compensation expense 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  gasco had followed accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  through december  for accounting for stock option awards to employees and directors which resulted in the accounting for grants of awards to employees and directors at their intrinsic value in the consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  gasco has recognized compensation expense in the financial statements for awards granted to consultants which must be re measured each period under the mark to market accounting method 
gasco had previously adopted the provisions of fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  through disclosure only 
on january   gasco adopted sfas no 
r  accounting for stock based compensation  using the modified prospective method 
under the modified prospective method  the adoption of sfas no 
r applies to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after december   as well as to the unvested portion of awards outstanding as of january  in accordance with the modified prospective method  we have not adjusted the financial statements for periods ended prior to january  the company did not recognize any one time effects of the adoption and continued to use similar option valuation models and assumptions as were used prior to january  the total fair value based compensation expense associated with prior awards that was not vested on the date of the adoption of sfas no 
r was approximately  which was expected to be recognized over the weighted average remaining life of the options of approximately one year

the production increase is due to the company s drilling  completion and recompletion activity during and and is partially offset by normal production declines on all wells 
gathering revenue and expense from gathering operations represents the income earned and expenses incurred from the riverbend area pipeline that was constructed by the company during and the gathering revenue increased by  during as compared with due to the increased production attributable to the outside working interest owners  resulting from the company s drilling activity in this area 
approximately  of the  increase in expense from gathering operations is due to the installation of additional compression to the system and approximately  of the increase is the result of the company s decision to revise its methodology for calculating charges related to compressor fuel 
the additional expense resulting from this change represents amounts that will be refunded to the outside working interest and royalty owners in the company s producing wells 
the remaining increase is related to increase operating costs related to the increased production in the area 
interest income increased  during compared with primarily due to higher interest rates and higher average cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances during relating primarily to the net proceeds of approximately  from the company s common stock offering during november lease operating expense increased  during compared with the increase is primarily due to the increased operational costs such as pumping  swabbing  chemicals  electricity  allocated overhead  etc 
of approximately  due to the increase in the number of producing wells from wells at december  to wells at december  also contributing to the higher lease operating expenses during is increased water hauling and disposal costs of approximately  and increased production and property taxes of  additionally  lease operating expense during includes approximately  of costs related to workovers performed on ten of our wells in the riverbend area in order to restore efficient operating conditions on these wells 
depletion  depreciation and amortization expense during is comprised of depletion expense related to the company s oil and gas properties  depreciation expense of furniture  fixtures and equipment and accretion expense related to the asset retirement obligation 
the increase of  is due primarily to the increase in oil and gas production and related capital costs resulting from the company s increased drilling and completion activity discussed above  partially offset by the  reduction in the full cost pool due to the impairment recorded during the second quarter of  as described below 
impairment expense during represents the impairment recorded as of june  because the present value of gasco s future net revenue discounted at exceeded the company s full cost pool based on current oil and gas prices of per barrel and per mcf 
general and administrative expense increased by  during as compared with the increase is primarily due to an increase in stock based compensation expense of  due to the adoption of sfas r on january  as further discussed in note of the accompanying financial statements and increased consulting expenses of approximately  related to the maintenance and testing of our internal controls 
the increased expenses were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  related to the capitalization of certain drilling and completion overhead and the allocation of internal administrative costs related to the operations of our wells during interest expense during and consists primarily of interest expense related to the company s outstanding convertible senior notes which were issued on october  compared to oil and gas revenue increased  during compared with due to an increase in oil and gas production of  bbls and  mcf combined with an increase in the average oil and gas prices of per bbl and per mcf during the  increase in oil and gas revenue during is comprised of  related to the production increase and  related to the price increase 
the production increase is due to the company s drilling  completion and recompletion activity during and and is partially offset by the production decrease resulting from the company s disposition of approximately of its revenue interest in two wells during the first quarter of and by normal production declines on all wells 
the company recognized gathering revenue of  and expenses from gathering operations of  during which represents the revenue earned and expenses incurred from the riverbend area pipeline 
the increase in this revenue and expense from is due to the full year of activity during as well as the increased production as described above 
interest income increased  during compared primarily due to higher average cash and cash equivalent and short term investment balances during relating primarily to proceeds from the company s  convertible senior note issuance during october and the proceeds from the common stock offering during november lease operating expense increased  during compared with primarily due to the increased number of producing wells during depletion  depreciation and amortization expense during increased as compared with due primarily to the increase in production and related costs resulting from the company s increased drilling and completion activity discussed above 
general and administrative expense increased by  during as compared with  primarily due to the company s increased operational activity 
the increase in these expenses is comprised of approximately  in salary expense and consulting fees associated with our increased operational activity   in fees associated with the company s audit of internal controls as required under the sarbanes oxley act of and  in stock based compensation primarily related to the company s restricted stock issuance and the issuance of stock options to consultants 
the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses is due to the fluctuation in numerous other expenses  none of which are individually significant 
interest expense during consists of interest expense related to the company s outstanding convertible senior notes which were issued on october  interest expense during consists of the interest on the company s outstanding convertible debentures issued in october that were converted into common stock during october and interest on the convertible senior notes for approximately two months
