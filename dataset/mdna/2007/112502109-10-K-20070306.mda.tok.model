item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
amounts in this section have been rounded to the nearest thousand  except percentages  ratios  per share data  numbers of franchise locations and numbers of businesses 
unless otherwise indicated  or unless the context otherwise requires  references to years in this section mean our fiscal years ended december general our primary business activity is insurance sales through franchisees and most of our revenues are generated from commissions paid on the sale of insurance 
commission revenues typically represent a percentage of insurance premiums paid by policyholders 
premium amounts and commission percentage rates are established by insurance companies  so we have little or no control over the commission amount generated from the sale of a specific insurance policy 
our business also includes lending to businesses that sell insurance and related services 
unlike commission revenues  lending interest rates are typically set by us  although competitive forces are important limiting factors when establishing rates 
brooke franchise most of our revenues are from commissions paid to brooke franchise  our wholly owned franchise subsidiary  by insurance companies for the sale of insurance policies on a retail basis through exclusive franchisees 
brooke franchise primarily relies on the recruitment of additional franchisees to increase retail insurance commission revenues 
brooke franchise s franchisees typically sell property and casualty insurance  such as automobile  homeowners and business owners insurance products 
brooke franchise also consults with business sellers and lenders 
brooke credit our wholly owned finance subsidiary generates most of its revenues from interest income resulting from loans held on our balance sheet in the form of inventory loans held for sale and from gains on sale of loans when they are removed from our balance sheet 
most of brooke credit s loans have been made to brooke franchise s franchisees  although an increasing share of loans have been made to insurance related businesses that are not franchisees 
brooke credit funds its loan portfolio primarily through the sale of loan 
table of contents participation interests to other lenders  sale of securities  backed by loan assets  to accredited investors  and on balance sheet funding from cash and short term lines of credit 
in february  we entered into an agreement by which brooke credit will merge with oakmont acquisition corp resulting in brooke credit becoming a public company with us as its largest shareholder 
the transaction is subject to oakmont shareholder approval and other closing conditions 
brooke brokerage our wholly owned subsidiary is a holding company for businesses expected to benefit from the insurance agent distribution network of brooke franchise 
brooke brokerage s insurance and loan brokerage subsidiary  cjd associates  llc  generates revenues from commissions paid by insurance companies for the sale of hard to place and niche insurance policies on a wholesale basis through our franchise agents and other insurance agents 
in and  cjd associates also used its industry contacts and expertise in insurance brokerage to broker loans for  and consult with  general insurance agencies specializing in hard to place insurance sales 
in january  we purchased of the capital stock of brooke savings bank formerly generations bank for the purpose of offering banking services for sale through our franchise agents and other insurance agents 
first american capital corporation in december and january  we acquired approximately on a fully diluted basis of the common stock of first american  the parent company of first life america corporation  a kansas domiciled life insurance company 
we plan to offer the life insurance and annuity products of first life america corporation through our franchise agents and other insurance agents 
subject to regulatory approvals and other closing conditions  in february  first american agreed to acquire brooke savings bank from brooke brokerage 
the acquisition of ownership interests in brooke savings bank and first life america corporation subsidiaries is part of a strategy to enable our franchisees to sell additional products and services that complement the standard property and casualty insurance policies they typically offer 
in connection with the transaction by which we acquired shares of first american common stock  brooke capital advisors  inc a subsidiary of first american capital corporation that was formerly known as first life brokerage  inc  began operating a managing general agency loan brokerage and consulting business in december  with respect to new consulting and collateral preservation services  and cjd associates ceased offering such services to new customers at that time 
brooke capital advisors  inc has expanded such business in to include similar services for funeral home businesses and loans related thereto and cjd associates is no longer engaged in this business 

table of contents results of operations our consolidated results of operations have been significantly impacted by expansion of franchise locations in recent years 
the following table shows income and expenses in thousands  except percentages and per share data for the years ended december   and  and the percentage change from year to year

the increases in interest income net primarily resulted from increased loan origination activities  increases in the amount of loans held in inventory for eventual sale and increases in retained interest from loans sold 
expenses are also expected to continue to increase as a result of opening new franchise locations in the increases of commission expense are primarily attributable to increases in insurance commissions received from insurance companies  because a share of insurance commissions is typically paid to franchisees 
payroll expenses  which include wages  salaries  payroll taxes and compensated absences expenses increased primarily as a result of the expansion of our franchise operations 
payroll expenses  as a percentage of total operating revenue  were approximately in  in and in other operating expenses  which 
table of contents include advertising  rent  travel  lodging  and office supplies  increased at a faster rate than total operating revenues in primarily as the result of increases in advertising expenses  company owned stored expenses see franchise services segment  below and collateral preservation expenses see lending services segment  below 
other operating expenses  as a percentage of total operating revenue  were approximately in  in and in the increases in other operating interest expense are primarily attributable to interest paid on bank lines of credit 
we use these lines of credit to fund our loans until we sell them in a securitization 
we consider line of credit  bond and debenture interest expense to be an operating expense because the proceeds from the lines of credit  bonds and debentures are used to partially fund our lending activities 
we consider interest expense  other than line of credit  bond and debenture interest expense  to be a non operating expense 
interest expense increased primarily as a result of increased debt to commercial banks  which was incurred primarily to capitalize our operating subsidiaries and to fund the over collateralization of our warehouse facilities and securitizations 
net income increased primarily as the result of increasing loan originations and loan balances resulting in increased loan interest and other loan related revenues 
net income per share for decreased primarily because an offering of common stock in august increased the number of outstanding shares by a larger percentage than the increase in net income 
net income per share also decreased as the result of adjusting the diluted earnings per share calculation to reflect the anticipated issuance of  shares of common stock that may result from our offering of perpetual convertible preferred stock that took place in the third quarter of the following table shows selected assets and liabilities in thousands  except percentages as of december   and  and the percentage change from year to year

a balance sheet account has also been established to reflect the interests of first american capital corporation s minority shareholders 

table of contents customer receivables primarily include amounts owed to brooke franchise by our franchisees and increased primarily from continued expansion of our franchise operations  especially the producer development program typically associated with start up franchises 
a loss allowance exists for brooke franchise s credit loss exposure to these receivable balances from franchisees see franchise services segment  below 
notes receivable include loans made by brooke credit to franchisees and others 
notes receivable balances vary  sometimes significantly from period to period  as a result of our decision to temporarily retain more or fewer loans in our held for sale loan inventory based on the funds available to us 
notes receivable balances increased as a result of increased volume of loan originations and the use of bank lines of credit 
no loss allowance has been made for the notes receivable held in brooke credit s loan inventory because we typically hold these assets for less than eight months and  therefore  have a short term exposure to loss  and we have experienced limited credit losses see lending services segment  below 
interest earned not collected on notes accrued interest income increased primarily because of the increase in the loan portfolio 
customer receivables  notes receivables  interest earned not collected on notes and allowance for doubtful accounts are the items that comprise our accounts and notes receivable  net  as shown on our consolidated balance sheet 
other receivables  which typically include the estimated amounts due from franchisees for future policy cancellations  fluctuate from period to period as the result of changes in policy cancellation rate calculations 
the securities balance primarily consists of two types of securities  interest only strip receivables in loan securitizations and retained interests in loan securitizations 
the terms of our securitizations require the over collateralization of the asset backed securities sold to investors 
we retain ownership of the resulting subordinate interest in the loan pool 
as cash is received for the interest only strip receivable as well as the principal attributable to our over collateralization retained interest  the securities balance declines 
the securities balance increased primarily as the result of a loan securitization during the third quarter of deferred charges includes primarily the fees associated with the issuance of long term debt by our finance company subsidiary and the costs of acquiring life insurance by our life insurance company indirect subsidiary 
these fees increased in primarily as the result of the acquisition of first american capital corporation and the fees associated with a private placement of debt in accounts payable  which includes franchise payables  producer payables  payroll payables and other accrued expenses  increased primarily from the continued expansion of our franchise operations  which increased the accrual for estimated commission expense due franchisees 
payable under participation agreements is the amount we owe to funding institutions that have purchased participating interests in loans pursuant to transactions that do not meet the true sale test of sfas  accounting for transfers and services of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
payable under participation agreements increased because we sold more loans pursuant to transactions that did not meet the true sale test 
the premiums payable liability category is comprised primarily of amounts due to insurance companies for premiums that are billed and collected by our franchisees 
premiums payable increased primarily from the continued expansion of our franchise operations  which resulted in an increase of premiums billed and collected by our franchisees 
premiums payable also increase from temporary fluctuations in agent billed activity 
debt increased primarily as the result of increasing the line of credit balances for the purpose of funding increasing loan inventory balances 
the line of credit balances were  and  at december  and  respectively

notes receivable balances include the loans originated by brooke credit to our franchisees and others  even though the notes may no longer be on our balance sheet 
note participations and asset backed securities are comprised of loan participation interests that we have sold to our funding institutions and securitization entities 
the note participation balance includes participations sold that are classified as a true sale and those that are not classified as a true sale or payable under participation agreements 
the asset backed securities exclude the portion of the securitization pools that are retained by us of   and  at december   and  respectively

the deferred tax liability is primarily due to the deferred recognition of revenues  for tax purposes  on loans sold until interest payments are actually received 

table of contents analysis by segment our three reportable segments are franchise services  lending services and brokerage services 
the franchise services segment includes the sale of general insurance and related services to customers on a retail basis through franchisees by brooke franchise 
the lending services segment includes our lending activities through brooke credit 
the brokerage segment includes the activities of brooke brokerage involving the sale of hard to place and niche insurance and the brokering of loans to other agencies that sell these kinds of insurance 
revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities for reportable segments were extracted from the separate audited financial statements prepared for each segment 
as such  consolidating entries are excluded and segment discussions will not always correspond to our consolidated financial statements 
each segment is assessed a shared services expense which is an internal allocation of legal  accounting  human resources  information technology and facilities management expenses based on our estimate of usage 
because consolidated entries are excluded  the other operating expense category for reportable segments include internal allocations for shared services expense during  and  of   and  respectively  for the franchise services segment    and  respectively  for the lending services segment and   and  respectively  for the brokerage segment 
revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities that are not allocated to one of the three reportable segments are categorized as corporate 
activities associated with corporate include functions such as accounting  auditing  legal  human resources and investor relations 
activities associated with corporate also include real estate ownership and corporate real estate management through brooke investments  inc and the operation of captive insurance companies that self insure portions of professional insurance agents liability exposure of brooke franchise  its affiliated companies and its franchisees and provide financial guaranty policies to brooke credit and its participating lenders 
in december  we acquired an ownership interest in first american capital corporation that resulted in a requirement to consolidate their financial information into our financial statements 
we have categorized the life insurance and brokerage activities of first american capital corporation as corporate 

table of contents franchise services segment financial information relating to brooke franchise and our franchise services segment is as follows in thousands  except percentages year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  revenues insurance commissions consulting fees gain on sale of businesses initial franchise fees for basic services initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans interest income other income total operating revenues expenses commission expense payroll expense amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations interest expense income before income taxes total assets at period end commission revenues retail insurance commissions have increased primarily as a result of brooke franchise s continued expansion of franchise operations 
brooke franchise also received commissions from the sale of investment securities that are not directly related to insurance sales 
however  these revenues are not sufficient to be considered material and are  therefore  combined with insurance commission revenues 
commission expense increased because insurance commission revenues increased and franchisees are typically paid a share of insurance commission revenue 
commission expense represented approximately  and  respectively  of brooke franchise s insurance commission revenue for the years ended december   and brooke franchise sometimes retains an additional share of franchisees commissions as payment for franchisee optional use of brooke franchise s service or sales centers 
however  all such payments are applied to service center sales center expenses and not applied to commission expense 
as of december  and  brooke franchise service centers sales centers totaled and  respectively 
profit sharing commissions  or brooke franchise s share of insurance company profits paid by insurance companies on policies written by franchisees  and other such performance compensation  increased  or  to  in and  or  to  in profit sharing commissions represented approximately  and  respectively  of brooke franchise s insurance commissions for the years ended december   and franchisees do not receive any share of brooke franchises profit sharing commissions 

table of contents net commission refund liability is our estimate of the amount of brooke franchise s share of retail commission refunds due to insurance companies resulting from future policy cancellations 
as of december  and  brooke franchise recorded corresponding total commission refund liabilities of  and  respectively 
correspondingly  commission refund expense decreased in to reflect this lower estimate 
payroll expense payroll expense increased partially as the result of developing the personnel  processes and systems required to support growth in franchise locations in and anticipated additional growth in payroll expense also increased partially as the result of the provision by brooke franchise of additional assistance to franchisees coping with financial stress resulting from less commission revenues from reduction of premium rates by insurance companies and increased expenses from higher interest rates 
other operating expenses other operating expenses represented approximately  and  respectively  of brooke franchise s total revenues for the years ended december   and other operating expenses increased at a faster rate than total operating revenues partially as the result of increases in operating expenses for company owned stores and increases in the advertising and other marketing assistance provided to franchisees 
other operating expenses also increased at a faster rate than total operating revenues partially as the result of the provision by brooke franchise of additional assistance to franchisees coping with financial stress resulting from less commission revenues from reduction of premium rates by insurance companies and increased expenses from higher interest rates 
advertising expenses increased  or  to  in from  in advertising expenses increased  or  to  in from  in marketing allowances made to franchisees increased  or  to  in from  in marketing allowances made to franchisees increased  or  to  in from  in operating expenses for company owned stores increased  or  to  in from  in although operating expenses from company owned stores represented a significant part of the overall increase in other operating expenses  these expenses were approximately the same as commission revenues generated by company owned stores totaling  and  respectively  for the years ended december  and company owned stores revenues and expenses for years prior to are not available 
initial franchise fees for basic services a certain level of basic services is initially provided to all franchisees  whether they acquire an existing business and convert it into a brooke franchise  start up a new brooke franchise location or acquire a company developed franchise location 
these basic services include services usually provided by other franchisors  including a business model  use of a registered trade name  access to suppliers and a license for an internet based management system 
the amount of the initial franchise fees typically paid for basic services is currently  and was  for most of we expect the initial franchise fee rate for basic services to increase as demand for access to our trade name  suppliers and business model increases 
revenues from initial franchise fees for basic services are recognized as soon as brooke franchise delivers the basic services to the new franchisee  such as access to insurance company contracts  access to the company s management system  and access to the company s brand name 
upon completion of this commitment  brooke franchise has no continuing obligation to the franchisee 
prior to  initial franchise fees for basic services were typically assessed once for each franchisee  even though some franchisees operated multiple locations 
beginning in  an initial franchise fee for basic services was assessed for each location 
a total of and new franchise locations were added during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the number of new franchise locations increased in 
table of contents as compared to primarily because the demand for access to our trade name  suppliers and business model increased in the increase in the amount of initial franchise fees for basic services resulted from continued expansion of brooke franchise s franchise operations  the increase in the amount of initial franchise fees for basic services and the change to charging initial franchise fees for basic services on a per location basis 
the following table summarizes information relating to initial franchise fees for basic services 
summary of initial franchise fees for basic services and the corresponding number of locations in thousands  except number of locations start up related initial franchise fees for basic services locations conversion related initial franchise fees for basic services locations company developed initial franchise fees for basic services locations total initial franchise fees for basic services locations year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans the amount of the total initial franchise fees for all initial services typically varies based on the level of additional assistance provided by brooke franchise  which is largely determined by the size of the acquisition 
we typically base our initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans on the estimated revenues of the acquired business 
we allocate initial franchise fees collected in excess of the initial franchise fees for basic services to initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans 
all initial franchise fees are paid to brooke franchise when an acquisition closes 
a significant part of brooke franchise s commission growth has come from acquisitions of existing businesses that are subsequently converted into brooke franchises 
the decrease in initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans is primarily attributable to a decrease in conversion activity  the increase in the amount charged for initial franchise fees for basic services  the change to charging initial franchise fees for basic services on a per location basis  and the establishment of a cap  or maximum amount  on initial franchise fees for buyers assistance plans that are charged for each acquisition 
brooke franchise provides assistance regarding the acquisition and conversion of businesses such as compilation of an inspection report which is delivered to franchisees on or prior to closing 
as such  brooke franchise performs substantially all of the buyers assistance plan services before an acquisition closes and  in  therefore  recognized all of the initial franchise fee revenue for buyers assistance plan at the time of closing 
however  in  a relatively small level of buyers assistance plan services were performed during the four months after acquisition  including reimbursements for advertising and training 
for this reason  a relatively small portion of the initial franchise fees for buyers assistance were correspondingly deferred until the service was performed 
to reflect revenues not yet earned  we deferred   and  of initial franchise fee revenues for buyers assistance plans as of december   and  respectively 
buyers assistance plans provide initial conversion assistance for recently acquired businesses and buyers assistance plan services are  therefore  not provided to buyers of businesses that are already franchises 
in addition  buyers assistance plans are not typically provided to franchisees selling to other franchisees and are not provided to franchisees purchasing businesses that had previously been purchased by brooke franchise in the past twenty four months 
a total of  and of the new franchise locations in  and  respectively  represent businesses that were converted into brooke franchises and received assistance through initial buyers assistance plans 

table of contents seller related revenues seller related revenues typically are generated when a business is acquired by brooke franchise for sale to a franchisee 
seller related revenues include consulting fees paid directly by sellers  gains on sale of businesses from deferred payments  gains on sale of businesses relating to company owned stores  and gains on sale of businesses relating to inventory 
a primary aspect of brooke franchise s business is the buying and selling of businesses 
therefore  all seller related revenues are considered part of normal business operations and are classified on our income statement as operating revenue 
seller related revenues decreased  or  to  in and decreased  or  to  in the trend of decreasing seller related revenues is partially attributable to an increasing emphasis by brooke franchise on recruitment of start up and company developed franchises and a decreasing emphasis on recruitment of conversion franchises to purchase businesses acquired by brooke franchise 
consulting fees 
brooke franchise helps sellers prepare their businesses for sale by developing business profiles  tabulating revenues  sharing its document library and general sale preparation 
the scope of the consulting engagement is largely determined by the size of the business being sold 
consulting fees are typically based on the transaction value  are contingent upon closing of the sales transaction  and are paid at closing 
brooke franchise completes its consulting obligation at closing and is not required to perform any additional tasks for the seller 
therefore  with no continuing obligation on the part of brooke franchise  consulting fees paid directly by sellers are recognized immediately 
gains on sale of businesses from deferred payments 
our business includes the buying and selling of insurance agencies and occasionally holding them in inventory 
when purchasing an agency  we typically defer a portion of the purchase price  at a low or zero interest rate  to encourage the seller to assist in the transition of the agency to one of our franchisees 
we carry our liability to the seller at a discount to the nominal amount we owe  to reflect the below market interest rate 
when we sell an acquired business to a franchisee typically on the same day it is acquired  we generally sell it for the full nominal price ie before the discount paid to the seller 
when the sale price of the business exceeds the carrying value  the amount in excess of the carrying value is recognized as a gain 
gains on sale resulting primarily from discounted interest rates increased  or  to  in and increased  or  to  in we regularly negotiate below market interest rates on the deferred portion of the purchase prices we pay sellers 
we consider these below market interest rates to be a regular source of income related to the buying and selling of businesses 
although we have a continuing obligation to pay the deferred portion of the purchase price when due  we are not obligated to prepay the deferred portion of the purchase price or to otherwise diminish the benefit of the below market interest rate upon which the reduced carrying value was based 
the calculation of the reduced carrying value  and the resulting gain on sale of businesses  is made by calculating the net present value of scheduled future payments to sellers at a current market interest rate 
the following table provides information regarding the corresponding calculations calculation of seller discounts based on reduced carrying values in thousands  except percentages and number of days beginning principal balance weighted average rate weighted average maturity interest rate used for net present value full nominal purchase price reduced carrying value gain on sale from deferred payments  days    days    days   gains on sale of businesses company owned stores 
if we expect to own and operate businesses for more than one year  we consider these businesses to be company owned stores and treat such transactions under purchase accounting principles  including booking intangible assets and recognizing the related amortization expense 
by contrast  businesses purchased for resale to our franchisees usually within one year are carried at 
table of contents cost as business inventory  without the booking of intangible assets 
gains on sale resulting from the sale of company owned stores was in and  in gains on sale of businesses inventoried stores 
as noted above  acquired businesses are typically sold on the same day as acquired for the same nominal price paid to the seller 
however  this is not always the case and businesses are occasionally held in inventory 
as such  gains and losses are recorded when an inventoried business is ultimately sold and carrying values of inventoried businesses are adjusted to estimated market value when market value is less than cost 
gains on sale resulting from the sale of inventoried stores decreased  or  to  in from  in gains on sale resulting from the sale of inventoried stores increased  or  to  in from  in income before income taxes brooke franchise s income before income taxes decreased  or  to  in from  in income before income taxes decreased  or  to  in from  in the reduction in income is partially attributable to an increase in payroll and other operating expenses incurred for the development of personnel  systems and infrastructure required to support growth in franchise locations in and anticipated additional growth in the reduction of income is also partially attributable to increasing payroll and other operating expenses incurred while assisting franchisees in coping with financial stress resulting from less commission revenues from reduction of premium rates by insurance companies while expenses have increased as the result of higher interest rates 
company owned stores this discussion of company owned stores is separated into four store types inventoried stores  managed stores  pending stores  and developed stores 
inventoried stores include businesses purchased by brooke franchise for resale to franchisees 
managed stores include businesses as to which brooke franchise has entered into agreements with franchisees to manage stores as a result of lender collateral preservation  the disability of the franchisee  the death of the franchisee or other circumstances 
pending stores include businesses that franchisees have contracted to sell  but the transactions have not yet closed  and brooke franchise is managing the store to reduce the likelihood of asset deterioration prior to closing 
managed and pending stores are not recorded as an asset on brooke franchise s balance sheet 
however  because brooke franchise is entitled by agreement to the income and responsible for the expenses of the business until the agreement terminates or ownership is transferred  such income and expenses of managed and pending stores are recorded to brooke franchise s income statement and we  therefore  include the business in our discussions of company owned stores 
brooke franchise develops business locations that have not been previously owned by a franchisee 
because the store has been developed by brooke franchise instead of purchased from third parties  all income and expenses associated with development and operation are recorded by brooke franchise as income and expenses  but an asset is not recorded on brooke franchise s balance sheet 
inventoried stores the number of total businesses purchased into inventory in  and was  and  respectively 
at december   and  respectively  brooke franchise held  and businesses in inventory with respective total balances  at the lower of cost or market  of   and  write down expense on inventoried stores  resulting from a decrease in the market values of inventoried businesses  for the years ended december   and totaled  and  respectively

expenses incurred in the operation of inventoried stores for and totaled  and  respectively 
the number of businesses twice purchased into inventory within twenty four months is an important indicator of brooke franchise s success in recruiting qualified buyers 
there were  and businesses twice purchased during  and  respectively 
some franchisees have experienced an adverse affect on profitability and cash flow from increased loan interest rates on agency acquisition loans and lower commissions resulting from the effect of decreased premium rates 
otherwise  brooke franchise is not aware of any systemic adverse profitability or cash flow trends being experienced by buyers of businesses from its inventory

same store sales revenue generation  primarily commissions from insurance sales  is an important factor in franchise financial performance and revenue generation is carefully analyzed by brooke franchise 
twenty four months after initial conversion of an acquired business  brooke franchise considers a franchise seasoned and the comparison of current to prior year revenues a more reliable indicator of franchise performance 
combined same store sales of seasoned converted franchises and start up franchises for years ended december  and decreased and  respectively 
the median annual revenue growth rates of seasoned converted franchises and qualifying start up franchises for the years ended december  and were and 
all same store calculations exclude profit sharing commissions 
same store calculations are based entirely on commissions allocated by brooke franchise to franchisees monthly statements 
brooke franchise is unable to determine the impact  if any  on same store calculations resulting from commissions that franchisees receive but do not process through brooke franchise as required by their franchise agreement 
same store sales performance has been adversely affected by the soft property and casualty insurance market  which is characterized by a flattening or decreasing of premiums by insurance companies 
our franchisees predominately sell personal lines insurance with more than of our total commissions resulting from the sale of auto insurance policies and brooke franchise believes that the insurance market has been particularly soft with regards to premiums on personal lines insurance policies 
franchise balances brooke franchise categorizes the balances owed by franchisees as either statement balances or non statement balances 
statement balances are generally short term and non statement balances are generally longer term 
we believe the most accurate analysis of franchise balances occurs immediately after settlement of franchisees monthly statements and before any additional entries are recorded to their account 
therefore  the following discussion of franchise balances is as of the settlement date that follows the corresponding commission month 
statement balances brooke franchise assists franchisees with short term cash flow assistance by advancing commissions and granting temporary extensions of due dates for franchise statement balances owed by franchisees to brooke franchise 
franchisees sometimes require short term cash flow assistance because of cyclical fluctuations in commission receipts 
short term cash flow assistance is also required when franchisees are required to pay brooke franchise for insurance premiums due to insurance companies prior to receipt of the corresponding premiums from policyholders 
the difference in these amounts has been identified as the uncollected accounts balance and this balance is calculated by identifying all charges to franchise statements for net premiums due insurance companies for which a corresponding deposit from policyholders into a premium trust account has not been recorded 
despite commission fluctuations and uncollected accounts balances  after 
table of contents initial conversion into its franchise system  brooke franchise expects franchisees to regularly pay their statement balances 
as such  brooke franchise categorizes as watch those statement balances that have not been repaid in full at least once in the previous four months 
the increase in watch statement balances is partially attributable to financial stress resulting from less commission revenues from reduction of premium rates by insurance companies and increased expenses from higher interest rates 
the following table summarizes total statement balances  uncollected account balances and watch statement balances as of september  and december  as of december  as of december  total statement balances uncollected accounts included in above total statement balances watch statement balances included in above total statement balances watch statement uncollected accounts these amounts are limited to uncollected balances for franchisees with unpaid statement balances as of december and these amounts are limited to uncollected balances for franchisees with watch statement balances as of december and non statement balances separate from short term statement balances  brooke franchise also extends credit to franchisees for long term producer development  including hiring and training new franchise employees  and for other reasons not related to monthly fluctuations of revenues 
these longer term non statement balances are not reflected in the short term statement balances referenced above and totaled  and  respectively  as of december and during the years ended december and  non statement balances increased at a faster rate than commissions primarily as a result of the increasing use of our producer development program by an increasing number of start up and company developed franchises 
brooke franchise s experience indicates that producer failure is usually identified within three months of initiating a producer development program and producer failure significantly increases the likelihood of credit losses 
therefore  brooke franchise categorizes as watch balances all balances for producers who are in the first three months of development 
watch non statement balances totaled  and  as of december and  respectively 
the decrease in watch non statement balances is attributable to the financing of more producer development expenses through lenders 
allowance for doubtful accounts the balance of brooke franchise s allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  respectively  on december  and the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts was determined based on analysis of brooke franchise s watch balances  write off experience and brooke franchise s evaluation of the potential for future losses 
the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts is partially attributable to an increase in watch statement balances and partially attributable to an increase in overall franchise balances 
the following table summarizes the allowance for doubtful accounts activity for december    and in thousands

typically the interest rate adjusts daily based on prime  however  approximately of brooke credit s portfolio as of december  adjusts annually based on prime and an immaterial amount of its loans adjust monthly based on prime 
as of december   brooke credit s variable loan portfolio had a weighted average index rate of approximately above prime  compared to approximately above prime as of december  as of december  and  the weighted average seasoning period of the loans in brooke credit s portfolio was months 
as of december   the weighted average months to maturity or remaining term was months  compared to months as of december  brooke credit mitigates credit risk by retaining industry consultants and franchisors collateral preservation providers to provide certain collateral preservation services  including assistance in the upfront analysis of a credit application  assistance with due diligence activities  assisting in ongoing surveillance of a borrower s business and providing certain loss mitigation activities associated with distressed loans 
loss mitigation activities typically include marketing support  operational support  management services and liquidation services 
for these collateral preservation services  brooke credit shares a portion of the loan fee and interest income received on loan balances over the life of the loans 
in  brooke franchise and brooke brokerage were the sole collateral preservation providers 
however  as loan balances increased during  brooke credit correspondingly increased the number of collateral preservation providers that it utilizes to help mitigate credit exposure and maintain credit quality 
during the year ended december   brooke credit paid  in collateral preservation fees to collateral preservation providers  including brooke franchise  brooke brokerage s subsidiary  cjd associates  llc  and first life brokerage  inc brooke capital advisors  inc 
as of february  all affiliates  compared to  paid for the year ended december  in some cases  these affiliates may contract with unaffiliated third parties to assist them in providing collateral preservation services 
in recent years  brooke credit s results of operations have been significantly impacted by the growth of its portfolio  the expansion of its loan funding sources  the development of a securitization model and the expansion of its lending programs 
the following table shows income and expenses in thousands  except percentages for the years ended december   and  and the percentage change from period to period 

table of contents year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  increase decrease over year ended december  operating revenues interest income participating interest expense gain on sale of notes receivable other income total operating revenues operating expenses other operating interest expense payroll expense amortization other operating expenses total operating expenses income from operations interest expense income before income taxes total assets at period end interest income brooke credit typically sells most of the loans it originates to funding institutions as loan participations and to accredited investors as asset backed securities 
prior to either type of sale transaction  brooke credit typically holds these loans on its balance sheet and earns interest income during that time 
after the loans are sold  brooke credit continues to earn interest income from the retained interests in these off balance sheet loans 
interest income increased primarily as a result of growth in brooke credit s on and off balance sheet loan balances in and participating interest expense a portion of the interest income that brooke credit receives on its loans is paid out to the holders of the participation interests and asset backed securities 
payments to these holders are accounted for as participating interest expense  which is netted against interest income in the consolidated statements of operations 
participating interest expense increased primarily as a result of the increase in participation interests and asset backed securities that were sold 
participation interest expense represented approximately  and  respectively  of brooke credit s interest income for the year ended december   and gain on sales of notes receivable when the sale of a loan is classified as a true sale pursuant to the criteria established by sfas  gains or losses are recognized  loans are removed from the balance sheet and residual assets are recorded 
brooke credit estimates the value of the residual assets by estimating the present value of the expected future cash flows from the interest and servicing spread  reduced by its estimate of credit losses and note receivable prepayments 
the interest and servicing spread is the difference between the rate brooke credit pays to participating lenders and investors and the rate received from its borrowers 
over time  as brooke credit receives cash from the payment of interest and servicing income  it reduces the value of the residual asset by writing down the interest asset and amortizing the servicing assets 
revenues from gain on sales of notes receivables decreased slightly in  as compared to the decrease occurred primarily because brooke credit securitized more notes receivable in than in revenues from gain on sales of notes receivables increased in  as compared to because brooke credit securitized more notes receivable in 
table of contents when the sale of a loan is not classified as a true sale pursuant to the criteria established by sfas  the sale is classified as a secured borrowing  no gain on sale is recognized  and the note receivable and the corresponding payable under participation agreement remain on the balance sheet 
one component of the gain on sales of notes receivable is the gain associated with brooke credit s ongoing servicing responsibilities 
when the sale of a loan participation is accounted for as a true sale  brooke credit retains servicing responsibilities for which it typically receives annual servicing fees ranging from to of the outstanding balance 
a gain or loss is recognized immediately upon the sale of a loan participation based on whether the annual servicing fees are greater or less than the cost of servicing  which is estimated at of the outstanding loan balance 
the gain or loss associated with loan servicing is determined based on a present value calculation of future cash flows from servicing the underlying loans  net of servicing expenses and prepayment assumptions 
for the years ended december   and  the net gains losses from loan servicing totaled   and  respectively  which consisted of gains from servicing benefits of   and  respectively  and losses from servicing liabilities of   and  respectively 
the increase in net gains from loan servicing benefits in is primarily the result of increased loan originations and loan participation sales 
the decrease in net gains from loan servicing benefits and servicing losses in is primarily the result of increased securitization activity and relatively fewer loan participation sales 
in a true sale  brooke credit also records a gain on sale for the interest benefit based on a present value calculation of future expected cash flows of the interest spread on the underlying loans sold  net of prepayment and credit loss assumptions 
at december   this spread was approximately for true sale participation loans sold and approximately for asset backed securities sold 
at december   this spread was approximately for true sale participation loans sold and approximately for asset backed securities sold 
these spread percentages discussed exclude the spread associated with related party loans sold  however  the following discussion of interest benefit gains and losses include related party loans sold  as those amounts are consolidated in brooke credit s results of operations 
during  and  the net gains from interest benefits totaled   and  respectively  which included gross gains from interest benefits of   and  respectively  and losses from write downs of retained interest asset to fair market value of   and  respectively 
the decrease in net gains from interest benefits in is primarily the result of securitizing fewer loans in and the increase in is primarily the result of increased loan originations  increased level of securitized loans and increased loan participation sales as compared to gains losses from servicing and interest benefits are typically non cash gains losses  as brooke credit receives cash equal to the carrying value of the loans sold 
a corresponding adjustment has been made on the statement of cash flows to reconcile net income to net cash flows from operating activities 
gain on sale accounting requires brooke credit to make assumptions regarding prepayment speeds and credit losses for participated loans and asset backed securities 
the performances of these loans are monitored  and adjustments to these assumptions will be made if necessary 
underlying assumptions used in the initial determination of future cash flows on the participation loans and asset backed securities accounted for as sales include the following business loans adjustable rate stratum business loans fixed rate stratum prepayment speed weighted average life months expected credit losses discount rate annual rates during the fourth quarter of  the discount rate assumption was changed from to 
several factors were considered when determining the discount rate 
as a starting point for analyzing this 
table of contents assumption  a range of the risk free rate was used to determine a base discount rate 
this base discount rate was then adjusted for various risk characteristics associated with the sold loans 
the most significant impact from the sale of loan participations and asset backed securities has been the removal of loans from brooke credit s balance sheet that it continues to service 
as of december  and december   the balances of those off balance sheet assets totaled  or of its portfolio  and  or of its portfolio  respectively 
these amounts exclude sales of related party loans of  as of december  and  as of december  the increased level of off balance sheet assets is primarily the result of a larger loan portfolio and the continued sale of loan participations and asset backed securities 
loan servicing assets and liabilities when brooke credit recognizes non cash gains for the servicing benefits of loan participation sales  it books that amount as a loan servicing asset on its balance sheet 
this amount is equal to brooke credit s estimate of the present value of future cash flows resulting from the servicing spread 
brooke credit recognizes such assets only when the income allocated to its servicing responsibilities exceeds its cost of servicing  which brooke credit typically estimates at of the loan value being serviced 
components of the servicing asset as of december  were as follows in thousands estimated cash flows from loan servicing fees less servicing expense discount to present value carrying value of retained servicing interest in loan participations in connection with the recognition of non cash losses for the servicing liabilities of loan participation sales  the present value of future cash flows was recorded as a servicing liability 
components of the servicing liability as of december  were as follows in thousands estimated cash flows from loan servicing fees less servicing expense discount to present value carrying value of retained servicing liability in loan participations 
table of contents loan participations interest only strip receivable asset to the extent that the difference between the rate paid by brooke credit to participating lenders and the rate received from its borrowers exceeds the maximum of allocated to the servicing benefit  brooke credit recognizes a non cash asset  called an interest only strip receivable asset  on its balance sheet 
this amount is equal to brooke credit s estimate of the present value of expected future cash flows resulting from this interest spread  net of credit loss to the extent loans are sold to participating lenders with recourse to the company and prepayment assumptions 
components of the interest receivable asset as of december  were as follows in thousands estimated cash flows from interest income less estimated credit losses discount to present value carrying value of retained interest in loan participations estimated credit losses from liability on sold recourse loans with balances totaling  as of december  credit loss estimates are based upon experience  delinquency rates  collateral adequacy  market conditions and other pertinent factors 
securitization interest only strip receivable asset the terms of brooke credit s securitizations require the over collateralization of the pool of loan assets that back the securities sold to investors 
brooke credit retains ownership of the resulting subordinate loan tranche in the loan pool and has historically borrowed money from commercial banks to fund this investment 
additionally  brooke credit recognizes a non cash gain from subordinate interest spread in the securitization cash flow  which is not sold to outside investors and is retained by brooke credit 
brooke credit  therefore  retains a credit exposure in each loan pool 
brooke credit s subordinate loan tranche and subordinate retained interest spread is included within securities on our balance sheet 
as of december    of the securities resulted from retained interests in securitizations 
the fair value of these securities is comprised of the subordinate loan tranche in the securitized loan pools totaling  the interest only strip receivable asset  evidencing retained interest spread  totaling  and the cash held in the securitization entities of  components of the interest receivable portion of securities as of december  were as follows in thousands estimated cash flows from interest income less estimated credit losses discount to present value carrying value of interest receivable portion of securities other income the decrease in other income is primarily attributable an impairment loss of  for the year ended december  during  the securitized pools of loans experienced increases in the prepayment rate  and  as a result  management determined that an other than temporary impairment occurred 
other operating interest expense the increase in other operating interest expense in and is primarily attributable to brooke credit retaining more loans on its balance sheet  resulting in the increased utilization of the lines of credit 
brooke credit typically uses these lines of credit to fund its loans until the loans are sold in a securitization 
other operating expenses the increase in other operating expenses in and is partially attributable to an increase in fees paid to consultants for assistance in monitoring borrower performance  
table of contents consulting with borrowers and otherwise assisting brooke credit in the preservation of collateral and improvement of borrower financial performance 
collateral preservation fees increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  additionally  other operating expenses increased as a result of increased expenses associated with securitization activities during and  which include legal fees  advisor fees  accounting fees  program fees  origination fees and other fees related to securitizations and the corresponding lines of credit 
total securitization related expenses increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  interest expense interest expense increased in primarily as a result of increased bank debt and a private placement debt offering in  which was incurred to fund the over collateralization of our warehouse facilities and securitizations  to retire bank debt with less favorable repayment terms and to fund the loan portfolio growth 
income before income taxes brooke credit s income before income taxes increased for the year ended december  compared to primarily because of increased interest income resulting from an increase in the company s loan origination volume and an increase in notes receivable balances held on the company s balance sheet at a lower cost of funds 
loan quality for the year ended december  and   and  respectively  in credit losses occurred on loans in our portfolio 
of these credit losses  for the year ended december    were associated with on balance sheet loans   associated with off balance sheet loans which have been securitized and associated with off balance sheet loans which have been sold to participating lenders 
as the loan tranche that brooke credit holds in the securitized loans is subordinate to the asset backed security investors  it did realize a write down of its securities balance as a result of the credit losses in the securitized loans 
of the credit losses realized by brooke credit as of december   were associated with retail agency loans to franchisees of brooke franchise and approximately were associated with retail agency loans that are not franchisees of brooke franchise 
at december  and december    and  respectively  loan balances were delinquent days or more 
of these delinquent loans as of december    were on balance sheet loans and  were off balance sheet loans which have been sold to participating lenders 
of these delinquent loans as of december   were associated with retail agency loans to franchisees of brooke franchise and were associated with retail agency loans that are not franchisees of brooke franchise 
brooke credit believes one important factor which has resulted in favorable credit performance for the company  its participating lenders and investors  results from the cash management feature imposed by brooke credit on its retail agency borrowers  which represents approximately of on and off balance sheet loans at december   excluding related party loans 
under this cash management feature  debt servicing associated with these loans are typically submitted directly to brooke credit from insurance companies or deducted from commissions received by brooke franchise prior to payment of commissions to the borrower and most other creditors 
brooke credit believes that credit problems associated with retail agency loans are more likely to be identified when it monitors borrower revenues on a monthly or quarterly basis rather than by monitoring brooke credits loan delinquencies 
brooke credit believes another important factor which has resulted in favorable credit performance for brooke credit  its participating lender and investors  is utilization of collateral preservation providers to perform collateral preservation services 
these services assist the lender in monitoring borrower performance  advising borrowers and otherwise assisting brooke credit in the preservation of collateral and improvement of borrower financial performance 
although credit performance has been favorable for brooke credit  its participating lenders and investors  the level of credit losses and the level of payment delinquencies increased during brooke credit believes that this increase is primarily attributable to increased strain placed on its borrowers resulting from conditions in 
table of contents which brooke credit had little or no control  such as increasing interest rates and a softening premium insurance market 
many of its borrowers are primarily engaged in insurance agency and brokerage activities and derive revenues from commissions paid by insurance companies  which commissions are based in large part on the amount of premiums paid by their customers to such insurance companies 
premium rates are determined by insurers based on a fluctuating market 
historically  property and casualty insurance premiums have been cyclical in nature  characterized by periods of severe price competition and excess underwriting capacity  or soft markets  which generally have an adverse effect upon the amount of commissions earned by brooke credit s insurance agency borrowers  followed by periods of high premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity  or hard markets 
the current insurance market generally may be characterized as soft  with a flattening or decreasing of premiums in most lines of insurance 
brooke credit expects increased levels of payment delinquencies and credit loss for brooke credit  its participating lenders and investors as the full impact of these market conditions are felt by its borrowers 
although we believe that credit loss exposure to brooke credit is limited on securitized loans and loan participations sold with recourse  the credit loss assumption used to calculate retained interest reduced brooke credit s expected retained interest associated with these loans by approximately  as of december  to allow for credit losses  which also reduced the amount of gain on sale revenue recognized at the time of each loan sale and resulted in a reduction of the carrying value of the corresponding asset on brooke credit s balance sheet 
other than these reductions in asset totals  brooke credit has not established a separate credit loss reserve 
perhaps a greater risk to brooke credit is the indirect exposure to credit losses that may be incurred by participating lenders  loan pool investors and warehouse loan providers 
in those cases in which brooke credit does not bear direct exposure to credit loss  if losses by participating lenders  loan pool investors and warehouse loan providers reach unacceptable levels  then brooke credit may not be able to sell or fund loans in the future 
brooke credit s business model requires access to funding sources to originate new loans  so the inability to sell loans would have a significant adverse effect on brooke credit

no claims or loss expense was incurred prior to db indemnity s reserve for claims was  and  respectively  on december  and reserves for claims on issued financial guarantee policies were recently established to reflect changes in general portfolio management and individual borrower circumstances 
db indemnity originally insured brooke credit loans that were eligible for securitization and  therefore  the insurance coverage periods were relatively short because policies were cancelled when the loans were securitized 
brooke credit has established lending facilities to inventory those loans eligible for securitization which eliminated the requirement for financial guaranty policies on this type of loan 
db indemnity now issues financial guaranty policies primarily on loans that are not eligible for securitization and  therefore  coverage is required for the life of the loan  which lengthens the coverage period 
claims are expected to increase as the coverage period increases 
future claims are also expected to increase because some borrowers experienced a reduction of commission revenues resulting from reduction of premium rates by insurance companies while expenses increased as the result of higher interest rates 
over a long term period  db indemnity expects the amount of claims expense incurred to be approximately the same as the amount of premium revenue recorded

brooke corporation as a holding company  brooke corporation s primary sources of revenues are derived from its operating subsidiaries from shared services fees  income tax sharing arrangements and dividends 
we believe that these sources of revenues are sufficient to fund brooke corporation s normal operations and pay its corporate expenses  income taxes and dividends 
in addition to funding normal operations  in brooke corporation funded an additional capital contribution of  to brooke credit and the purchase of stock in first american for  brooke corporation also funded an additional equity contribution of  to brooke brokerage in january  these contributions were funded by brooke corporation with reductions in cash reserves  long term debt and preferred stock sale proceeds 
brooke corporation may be required to make additional equity contributions in to db indemnity  ltd 
to fund the increases in capital that may be required to write additional financial guaranty policies 
because brooke corporation is dependent on revenues from its subsidiaries  it intends to limit the amount of debt incurred to fund capital contributions to subsidiaries and stock purchases  thereby limiting the amount of revenues required from subsidiaries to service brooke corporation s debt 
as such  brooke corporation may raise additional equity capital in brooke franchise our franchise subsidiary acquired a short term loan in in the amount of  to fund balances owed to brooke franchise by its franchisees 
brooke franchise expects to issue long term debt in to replace this short term loan 
to satisfy its normal capital needs  brooke franchise is dependent on the recruitment of additional franchisees and on the availability of loans for these new franchisees from brooke credit 
cash of  and  respectively  was generated from franchise operating activities in and brooke franchise does not anticipate any requirement in for additional equity capital contributions from brooke corporation or other investors although it may issue long term debt for expansion or other purposes

brooke corporation contributed  in additional equity capital to brooke credit in and funded this capital contribution with the issuance of  in long term debt 
to the extent that additional equity capital is required in the future  brooke credit does not intend to rely on additional equity capital investments from brooke corporation and  in certain circumstances  may solicit capital investments from other investors 
consistent with these plans  in february  we entered into a definitive agreement by which brooke credit is expected to merge with oakmont acquisition corp 
if the merger closes as expected  it will significantly increase brooke credit s equity capital 
the planned merger will result in brooke credit becoming a public company with brooke corporation as its largest shareholder  which we believe will improve brooke credit s prospects to raise additional equity capital in the future 
the merger is subject to numerous closing conditions and  therefore  there is no assurance that the merger will close 

table of contents brooke credit loan participations brooke credit continues to rely on loan participation sales as a source of funding those loan types that are not yet qualified for brooke credit s bank lines of credit or the securitization model and also those loans that are prohibited from being sold to brooke credit s warehouse entities due to excess concentration restrictions

based on brooke credit s experience in recent years  brooke credit believes that it can continue to sell asset backed securities in the future 
however  if the market for these securities is such that it cannot  then brooke credit believes that the funding shortfall can be partially offset with the sale of more loan participations through its lender network and with increased borrowing from its bank lines of credit

our principal capital commitments consist of bank lines of credit  term loans  deferred payments to business sellers and obligations under leases for our facilities 
we have entered into enforceable  legally binding agreements that specify all significant terms with respect to the contractual commitment amounts in the table above 
critical accounting policies our established accounting policies are summarized in footnotes and to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and as part of our oversight responsibilities  we continually evaluate the propriety of our accounting methods as new events occur 
we believe that our policies are applied in a manner that is intended to provide the user of our financial statements with a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
we believe that the following accounting policies are critical 
these accounting policies are more fully explained in the referenced footnote to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the following discussions summarize how we identify critical accounting estimates  the historical accuracy of these estimates  sensitivity to changes in key assumptions  and the likelihood of changes in the future 
the following discussions also indicate the uncertainties in applying these critical accounting estimates and the related variability that is likely to result in 
table of contents franchisees share of undistributed commissions we are obligated to pay franchisees a share of all commissions we receive 
prior to allocation of commissions to a specific policy  we cannot identify the policy owner and do not know the corresponding share percentage of commissions to be paid 
we estimate the franchisee s share of commissions to determine the approximate amount of undistributed commissions that we owe to franchisees 
an estimate of franchisees shares of undistributed commissions is made based on historical rates of commission payout  management s experience and the trends in actual and forecasted commission payout rates 
although commission payout rates will vary  we do not expect significant variances from year to year 
we regularly analyze and  if necessary  immediately change the estimated commission payout rates based on the actual average commission payout rates 
the commission payout rate used in to estimate franchisees share of undistributed commissions was and the actual average commission payout rate to franchisees net of profit sharing commissions was for the year ended december  we believe that these estimates will not change substantially during allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is comprised primarily of allowance for estimated losses related to amounts owed to us by franchisees for short term credit advances  which are recorded as monthly statement balances  and longer term credit advances  which are recorded as non statement balances 
losses from advances to franchisees are estimated by analyzing all advances recorded to franchise statements that had not been repaid within the previous four months  all advances recorded as non statement balances for producers who are in the first three months of development  total franchise statement balances  total non statement balances  historical loss rates  loss rate trends  potential for recoveries  and management s experience 
loss rates will vary and significant growth in our franchise network could accelerate those variances 
the effect of any such variances can be significant 
the estimated allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  was  the estimated allowance was approximately of the actual amount of losses from advances made to franchisees for the year ended december   approximately of the actual total combined franchise statement and non statement balances as of december   and approximately of the actual combined advances recorded to franchise statements that had not been repaid during the year period ended december  and recorded as non statement balances for producers in the first three months of development 
we believe that this estimate will increase during primarily as a result of our growing franchise operations and increased emphasis on producer development for start up franchises 
reserves for insurance claims reserves for insurance claims are comprised of amounts set aside for claims on db indemnity  ltd 
insurance policies 
db indemnity is a captive insurance company that issues financial guaranty policies covering loans originated by brooke credit corporation 
reserves for claims on db indemnity insurance policies are estimated by analyzing historical claim payments  the amount delinquent loans  the amount of loans in which default has been declared  the amount of loans in which an obligor s business revenues have experienced a significant decline resulting in inadequate repayment ability and or collateral support  the amount of loans in which material change in an obligor s or guarantor s financial condition has occurred or is expected to occur  the amount of start up franchise loans that have matured and the borrower has not achieved the required minimum monthly commission benchmark  and management s experience 
claim payments will vary and significant growth in the issuance of financial guaranty insurance policies or changes in policy underwriting could accelerate those variances 
the effect of any such variances can be significant 
the estimated reserve for insurance claims as of december  was  for the year ended december   db indemnity incurred  in claims or loss expense 
no prior claims or loss expense were incurred since beginning operations in discount  prepayment and credit loss rates used to record loan participation sales and asset backed securities sales we regularly sell the loans that we originate to banks and finance companies 
accounting for the sale of loan participations and loan securitizations and the subsequent tests for impairment are summarized in footnote to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and 
table of contents loan participations and loan securitizations represent the transfer of notes receivable  by sale  to participating lenders or special purpose entities 
the fair value of retained interests and servicing assets resulting from the transferred loans are recorded in accordance with the criteria established by sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
we typically estimate fair value based on the present value of future expected cash flows  which requires us to make assumptions about credit losses  prepayment speed and discount rates 
most of our loans are adjustable rate loans on which  in  we assumed credit losses of each year  prepayment speeds of each year and a discount rate of 
these assumptions are made based on historical comparisons  management s experience and the trends in actual and forecasted portfolio prepayment speeds  portfolio credit losses  risk free interest rates and market interest rates 
we regularly analyze the accuracy of our assumptions of prepayment speeds  credit losses and discount rate and make changes when necessary 
we believe that changes to these assumptions are unlikely during the remainder of however  it is important to note that our actual annualized prepayment rate for the entire portfolio has increased to approximately through the year ended december  primarily due to increased asset ownership transfers to borrowers within our portfolio  new loan documents being executed on existing loans to improve security interests  and the increasing interest rate environment 
we expect that  over the remaining life of its loan portfolio  several cycles of increasing and decreasing prepayment rates will likely occur primarily resulting from fluctuations in key interest rates and changes in the insurance marketplace 
as of december   we tested retained interests for impairment and the resulting analysis of prepayments speeds and credit losses for the various loan pools indicated that our assumptions were historically accurate 
during  the securitized pools of loans experienced an increase in the prepayment rate  and as a result  management determined that an other than temporary impairment occurred 
we recorded an impairment loss of  for the year ended december  we believe that  over the life of the securitizations  the prepayment rate assumption used continues to be appropriate 
the effect of variances can be significant and the impact of changes in these estimates is more specifically described in footnote to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and subsequent to the initial calculation of the fair value of retained interest  the company utilizes a fair market calculation methodology to determine the ongoing fair market value of the retained interest 
ongoing fair value is calculated using the then current outstanding principal of the transferred notes receivable and the outstanding balances due unaffiliated purchasers  which are reflective of credit losses and prepayments prior to the fair value recalculation 
the rates of write down of the retained interest are based on the current interest revenue stream 
this revenue stream is based on the loan balances at the date the impairment test is completed  which will include all prepayments on loans and any credit losses for those loans 
as of december   as a result of the above mentioned increased prepayment speeds  the fair value of the retained interests declined during  resulting in an impairment loss 
amortization and useful lives we acquire insurance agencies and other businesses that we intend to hold for more than one year 
we record these acquisitions as amortizable intangible assets 
accounting for amortizable intangible assets  and the subsequent tests for impairment are summarized in footnote g to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and the rates of amortization of amortizable intangible assets are based on our estimate of the useful lives of the renewal rights of customer and insurance contracts purchased 
we estimate the useful lives of these assets based on historical renewal rights information  management s experience  industry standards  and trends in actual and forecasted commission payout rates 
the rates of amortization are calculated on an accelerated method declining balance based on a year life 
as of december   we tested amortizable intangible assets for impairment and the resulting analysis indicated that our assumptions were historically accurate and that the useful lives of these assets exceeded the amortization rate 
the amortizable intangible assets have a relatively stable life and unless unforeseen circumstances occur  the life is not expected to change in the foreseeable future 
because of the relatively large remaining asset balance  changes in our estimates could significantly impact our results 
the rates of amortization of servicing assets are based on our estimate of repayment rates  and the resulting estimated maturity dates  of the loans that we service 
loan repayment rates are determined using assumptions 
table of contents about credit losses  prepayment speed and discount rates as outlined in the discussion above about the fair values of servicing assets 
as of december   an analysis of prepayment speeds and credit losses indicated that our assumptions were historically accurate and the maturity date estimates were reasonable 
although significant changes in estimates are not expected  because of the relatively large remaining asset balance  changes in our estimates that significantly shorten the estimated maturity dates could significantly impact our results 
loan origination expenses brooke credit typically sells loans soon after origination and retains responsibility for loan servicing 
however  most of brooke credit s operating expenses are associated with loan origination 
we analyze our lending activities to estimate how much of brooke credit s operating expenses should be allocated to loan origination activities and  therefore  matched  or offset  with the corresponding loan origination fees collected from borrowers at loan closing 
the estimated allocations of payroll and operating expenses to loan origination activities are based on management s observations and experience  job descriptions and other employment records  and payroll records 
although not expected  significant changes in our estimate of expense allocations could significantly impact our results  because loan fees amounts are significant to us 
income tax expense an estimate of income tax expense is based primarily on historical rates of actual income tax payments 
the estimated effective income tax rate used in to calculate income tax expense was 
although not expected  significant changes in our estimated tax rate could significantly impact our results 
we believe this estimate will not change significantly during revenue recognition policies revenue recognition is summarized in footnote e to our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december  and with respect to the previously described critical accounting policies  we believe that the application of judgments and assumptions is consistently applied and produces financial information which fairly depicts the results of operations for all years presented 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing operations  we make loans to franchisees and others to fund purchases or start ups of insurance agencies or funeral homes or ongoing working capital needs 
we engage in the sale of loan participation interests in individual loans to banks and finance companies and the securitization of pools of insurance agency loans 
these typically meet the requirements of true sales as outlined in fas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishment of liabilities 
the sale of loan participations and loan securitizations has resulted in the removal of a significant amount of loans from our balance sheet 
the loan sales enable us to reduce our capital investment in our financing subsidiary  reduce credit risk by removing loans from the balance sheet  recognize gains on sales of loans  and fund additional loans 
even when loans are removed from the balance sheet  however  some risk is retained with respect to those loans that are sold with recourse and the over collateralized portion of securitized loan pools 
see retained securities and loans sold with recourse  below 
credit losses associated with recourse notes  retained interest held in securities and retained servicing obligations in excess of management s assumptions could materially and adversely affect our operations and financial condition 
although credit performance has historically been favorable for us  our participating lenders and our asset backed security investors  the level of credit losses and payment delinquencies increased during due  in part  to increasing interest rates and a softening insurance premium insurance market 
we expect increased levels of delinquencies  defaults and credit losses as the full impact of these market conditions are felt by the company s borrowers 

table of contents loan sales and securitizations when the sale of a loan is classified as a true sale  gains or losses are recognized  loans are removed from the balance sheet and residual assets  representing the present value of future cash flows from the interest and servicing spread  are recorded 
future cash flows are reduced by the amount of estimated credit losses and notes receivable prepayments  based on management s assumptions and estimates 
the following table reports for each of the six securitizations in which we have been involved during fiscal years   and the amount of loans sold to a qualifying special purpose entity  the amount of asset backed securities issued as a part of the securitization  the amount of servicing income received by the company for the year ended december   the fair value of the difference between loans sold and securities issued to accredited investors and the fair value of the interest receivable retained recorded as a security for the period ended december   the portion of the security comprised of retained interest  and the portion of the security comprised of retained equity in the special purchase entity 
securitization table in thousands date of securitization original amount of loans sold original amount of asset backed securities issued servicing income received during fair value at december  retained interest at december  retained equity cash reserves at december  april november june march december july total at december   and  we had transferred assets with balances totaling   and  respectively  that were accounted for as true sales  resulting in pre tax gains for the years ended december   and of   and  respectively 
purchasers of these notes receivable obtained full control over the transferred assets ie notes receivable and obtained the right  free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right  to pledge or exchange the notes receivable 
furthermore  the agreements to transfer assets do not entitle  or obligate  us to repurchase or redeem the notes receivable before their maturity except in the event of an uncured breach of a representation or warranty 
servicing and retained interest assets when we sell loan participations  we generally retain servicing income and recognize non cash gains for the servicing benefits related to the loan sale 
in recognizing such gains  we book a loan servicing asset on our balance sheet equal to our estimate of the present value of future cash flows resulting from the servicing spread 
we recognize such assets only when the income allocated to our servicing responsibilities exceeds our cost of servicing  which we typically estimate at of the loan value being serviced 
on loan participations  we are typically paid annual servicing fees ranging from to of the outstanding loan balance 
on loan securitizations  we are typically paid annual servicing fees ranging from to of the outstanding securitized loan balances 
when the annual service fees paid to us are less than the minimum cost of servicing  which is estimated at of the outstanding balance  a servicing liability is recorded 
to the extent that the difference between the rate paid by brooke credit to participating lenders and investors and the rate received by brooke credit from borrowers exceeds the maximum of allocated to the servicing benefit  brooke credit recognizes a non cash asset  called an interest receivable asset  on its balance sheet 
this amount is equal to our estimate of the present value of future cash flows resulting from this interest spread 
with respect to sale of loan participations  our right to interest income is not subordinate to the 
table of contents purchaser s interests and we share interest income with purchasers on a pro rata basis 
although not subordinate to the purchaser s interests  our retained interest is subject to credit and prepayment risks on the transferred assets 
on loan participations sold with recourse  our retained interest is subject to credit risk on the transferred assets 
at december  and  we recorded the value of the servicing asset at  and  respectively  and the value of the servicing liability at  and  respectively 
at december  and  we recorded the fair value of retained interest at  and  respectively  with  and  respectively  listed as interest only strip receivable on our balance sheet  and  and  respectively  in retained interest carried in our securities 
components of the loan servicing asset  servicing liability  interest receivable asset relating to loan participation sales as of december  were as follows in thousands servicing asset servicing liability interest receivable asset estimated cash flows from loan servicing fees interest income less servicing expense estimated credit losses discount to present value carrying value estimated credit losses from liability on sold recourse loans with balances totaling  as of december  credit loss estimates are based upon experience  delinquency rates  collateral adequacy  market conditions and other pertinent factors 
retained securities the terms of brooke credit s securitizations require the over collateralization of the pool of loan assets that back the securities sold to investors 
brooke credit retains ownership of the resulting subordinate interest in the loan pool and borrows money from commercial banks to fund this investment 
as such  our retained interest is subject to credit and prepayment risks on the transferred assets 
as of december   brooke credit had subordinate investment interest in loan pools totaling  part of which is the carrying value of our retained interest in asset backed securities 
in connection with the recognition of non cash gains for the interest benefits of asset backed securities sales  the present value of future cash flows was recorded as an interest receivable asset and included on the balance sheet as part of the investment securities balance 
components of the interest receivable asset as of december  were as follows in thousands estimated cash flows from interest income less estimated credit losses discount to present value carrying value of retained interest in asset backed securities we annually evaluate and measure the retained interest and servicing assets for potential impairment 
impairment testing involves comparing our current discounted value of future interest and servicing revenue with our carrying value for the retained interest and servicing assets 
if the new discounted revenue stream is less than the value on the books  further analysis is performed to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
if an other than temporary impairment has occurred  we write the asset to the new discounted revenue stream 

table of contents the actual prepayment rate on our loans increased to approximately during the year ended december  primarily due to the increased asset ownership transfers to other borrowers within brooke credit s portfolio  new loan documents being executed on existing loans to improve security interests and the increasing interest rate environment 
the company expects that  over the remaining life of the loan portfolio  several cycles of increasing and decreasing prepayment rates will likely occur  primarily resulting from fluctuations in key interest rates and changes in the marketplace 
because of the increases in the prepayment rate experienced in  management determined that an other than temporary impairment occurred 
the company recorded an impairment loss of  for the year ended december  we believe that over the life of the securitizations the prepayment rate assumption used continues to be appropriate 
no impairment was recognized in the years ended december  and in addition  we conduct sensitivity analysis to evaluate the potential impact of a to change in the key economic assumptions used in valuing our retained interest and servicing assets 
these key economic assumptions include prepayment speed  expected credit losses and discount rate 
as of december   an increase in these key economic assumptions by to generally results in decreases of to in the value of the retained interest and servicing assets 
more drastic changes to economic and market conditions than those we have modeled would likely lead to greater diminution in the value of the retained interest and servicing assets 
loans sold with recourse the business and real estate loans on our balance sheet at december  and   and  respectively  were sold to various participating lenders with recourse to brooke credit corporation 
such recourse is limited to the amount of actual principal and interest loss incurred and any such loss is not due for payment to the participating lender until such time as all collateral is liquidated  all actions against the borrower are completed and all liquidation proceeds applied 
however  participating lenders may be entitled to periodic advances from brooke credit corporation against liquidation proceeds in the amount of regular loan payments 
at december   all such recourse loans a had no balances more than days past due  b had adequate collateral  and c were not in default 
market conditions and strategies affecting sale and securitization transactions our lending operations depend on our ability to sell either loan participation interests or securities backed by our originated loans to banks and finance companies 
we believe that our relationships with participating lenders and loan pool investors have been good  that investor interest in our loans has been strong  and that we will continue to have available purchasers of our loan participation interests and asset backed securities 
several factors  however  will affect our ability to sell participation interests in our loans and to complete securitizations  including conditions in the securities markets  generally  conditions in the asset backed securities markets  changes in interest rates and their impact on credit losses and prepayment speed  the credit quality and performance of our financial instruments and loans  our ability to adequately service our financial instruments and loans  and  the absence of any downgrading or withdrawal of ratings given to securities previously issued in our securitizations 
one of our goals is to fund an increasing number of originated loans through our warehouse lines of credit  leading up to the time of loan securitizations 
to do so  our debt is expected to increase 
the increase in our debt may cause our network of participating lenders to become uncomfortable and  as a result  we may not be able to sell participation interests in loans we originate on terms acceptable to us or at all 
such result would have a material adverse effect on our operations and prospects for growth 
accordingly  we are cautiously monitoring our increased debt totals resulting from warehouse funding activities and the comfort of the network of participating lenders and will modify our method of funding practices as needed to maintain a significant network of purchasers of loans 
we are considering alternative warehouse structures to reduce our debt 
however  no assurances cab be made that we will find an acceptable alternative 

table of contents a material change in any of the foregoing economic and market conditions would likely have a material adverse effect on our ability to pursue sales of our loan participations or loan securitizations 
in addition  such changes in economic and market conditions could lead to an impairment in the value of our retained interest and servicing assets 
either the loss of our loan sale markets or an impairment in the retained interest and servicing assets could  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in the event of such material change in economic and market conditions  we would likely examine a range of strategic options  including evaluating our current capital structure  the availability of credit sources in addition to the loan participation and loan securitization markets  a possible reduction in the expansion of our franchise network  a possible curtailment in our lending operations  and  an examination of our internal cost and operating structure 
we would make no such change prior to thoroughly evaluating our alternatives and market conditions 
while our management cannot predict market conditions or the reactions of participating lenders to changes in market conditions or our strategies  we are unaware of any trends or uncertainties that are reasonably likely to materially reduce our ability to sell loans and remove them from our balance sheet under current accounting rules  or any need to consider any such strategic options at this time 
proposed accounting changes in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued an exposure draft which amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
this exposure drafts seeks to clarify the derecognition requirements for financial assets and the initial measurement of interests related to transferred financial assets that are held by a transferor 
our current off balance sheet securitizations in our lending services segment could be required to be consolidated in our financial statements based on the provisions of the exposure draft 
we will continue to monitor the status of the exposure draft and consider what changes  if any  could be made to the structure of the securitizations to continue to derecognize loans transferred to the securitization special purpose entities 
at december   the securitization special purpose entities held loans totaling  million  which we could be required to consolidate into our financial statements under the provisions of this exposure draft 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see footnote to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the effects of the adoption of new accounting standards 
related party transactions see footnote to our consolidated financial statements for information about related party transactions 
impact of inflation and general economic conditions although inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations  increases in the inflation rate are generally associated with increased interest rates 
a significant and sustained increase in interest rates could adversely affect our franchisees ability to repay the variable rate loans that we have made to them and thereby adversely affect our profitability 
such an interest rate increase could also adversely affect our profitability by increasing our interest expenses and other operating expenses 
a significant change in the credit markets could also have an adverse impact on our operations 
our lending operations depend on our ability to sell either loan participation interests or securities backed by our insurance agency loans to banks and finance companies 
several factors will affect our ability to sell participation interests in our loans and to complete securitizations  including conditions in the securities markets  generally  conditions in the asset backed securities markets  changes in interest rates and their impact on credit losses and prepayment speed  the credit quality and performance of our financial instruments and loans  
table of contents our ability to adequately service our financial instruments and loans  and the absence of any downgrading or withdrawal of ratings given to securities previously issued in our securitizations 
a significant change in interest rates or in the willingness to extend credit could have a significant and adverse impact on our ability to make loans and  by extension  to continue expanding our agency network 
a significant change in interest rates could also affect the cash flows associated with our servicing assets and liabilities  our retained interest assets related to our loan participation and securitization sales  and the value of our investment in the subordinate interests in our securitizations 
we make certain assumptions about the rate of prepayment by our borrowers and the credit losses of our loan portfolio 
in the event of a sudden increase in interest rates  it is reasonable to expect that credit losses would increase  as our borrowers found it increasingly costly to make their interest payments 
our assumptions about the prepayment rates on loans could also be subject to change in the event of a sudden increase or decrease in interest rates 
our business is also dependent on the cyclical pricing of property and casualty insurance  which may adversely affect our franchisees performance and  thus  our financial performance 
our franchisees primarily derive their revenues from commissions paid by insurance companies  which commissions are based largely on the level of premiums charged by such insurance companies 
in turn  we earn fees from our franchisees based upon the commissions earned by our franchisees 
because these premium rates are cyclical  our financial performance is dependent  in part  on the fluctuations in insurance pricing 
although the current insurance market generally may be characterized as soft  with a flattening or decreasing of premiums in most lines of insurance  it is likely that insurance pricing will decrease further in the future  subjecting us to lower commissions on the insurance placed by our franchisees 
a steep decline in insurance pricing could have a significant and adverse impact on our franchisees  because the commissions that they earn would likely decrease along with insurance pricing 
that adverse impact would likely reduce our share of our franchisees insurance commissions and could also hurt our franchisees ability to make timely payment of principal and interest on our loans 
a general decline in economic activity in the united states or in one of the states or geographic regions in which we operate  such as california  texas  the southwest  the midwest or the southeast  could also affect our results and financial condition 
an adverse change in economic activity could reduce the ability of individuals and small businesses the key customers for our franchisees to purchase insurance and other financial services 
in such event  the revenue growth rate of our franchisees could flatten or decline  in turn reducing our revenues and hurting our franchisees ability to make timely interest and principal payments on their loans 
all other schedules have been omitted because they are either inapplicable or the required information has been provided in the consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we originate loans which will generally be sold to funding institutions as participation interests or to accredited investors as asset backed securities 
the substantial majority of the loans are adjustable rate loans based on a prime rate plus a margin and interest rate changes will impact their value  and may impact credit losses and prepayments associated with the loans 
although credit performance has been favorable for us  our participating lenders and investors  the level of credit losses and payment delinquencies increased during due  in part  to increasing interest rates 
we expect increased levels of delinquencies  defaults and credit losses as the full impact of these market conditions are felt by the company s borrowers 
also  the actual annualized prepayment rate on loans increased to approximately during the year ended december  primarily due to increased asset ownership transfers to other borrowers within our 
table of contents portfolio  new loan documents being executed on existing loans to improve security interests  and the increasing interest rate environment 
we expect that  over the remaining life of the loan portfolio  several cycles of increasing and decreasing prepayment rates will likely occur  primarily resulting from fluctuations in key interest rates and changes in the insurance marketplace 
as a result of the increased prepayment speeds  the fair value of retained interests from transferred loans declined during management continues to analyze the decline and  upon testing of impairment as of december   an impairment loss of  was incurred for the year 
when interest rates on our loan assets do not adjust at the same rates as our liabilities associated with those assets  our earnings are subject to risk 
interest rate risk associated with loan assets and funding liabilities prior to the sale of the loans is minimized by the fact that loans are generally held for less than one year 
we further manage interest rate risk on loan assets and liabilities remaining after the sale of the loans by matching our cost of funds with the rate structure of the underlying loans 
we apply interest rates on those assets and liabilities that float at a spread above the prime rate  so that  when interest rates on the assets adjust  the interest rates on the liabilities adjust correspondingly 
when we make loans to borrowers in canada  our loans are denominated in foreign currency 
these loans are subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies 
among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances  the level of short term interest rates  differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies  long term opportunities for investment and capital appreciation  and political developments 
we do not currently employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks 
when loans are sold  and the sale of participation interests or asset backed securities is classified as a true sale  we record a gain on sale for the interest benefit based on a present value calculation of future cash flows of the underlying loans  net of prepayment and credit loss assumptions 
when the sale of a loan participation interest is accounted for as a true sale  we retain servicing responsibilities for which we receive annual servicing fees based on a percentage of the outstanding balance 
the gain or loss associated with loan servicing is determined based on present value calculations of future cash flows from the servicing the underlying loans  net of prepayment assumptions 
the present value calculations of future cash flows of underlying loans and future cash flows from the servicing of underlying loans are based in part on management s estimates of discount rates 
underlying loans with adjustable interest rates are evaluated separately from loans with fixed interest rates 
a significant rise in interest rates could result in the impairment of retained interest and servicing assets and adversely affect the company s business financial condition and results of operation 
impairment is evaluated and measured annually 
as reported above  upon testing of impairment as of december   an impairment loss of  was incurred for the year 
no impairment was recognized in the years ended december  and we continuously monitor market conditions  interest rate changes and market comparables  evaluate the propriety of the discount rate utilized in our assumptions  and assess interest rate sensitivity as an indication of interest rate risk 
at december   key economic assumptions used in measuring the retained interests and servicing assets when loans were sold or securitized during the year were as follows rates per annum business loans adjustable rate stratum business loans fixed rate stratum prepayment speed weighted average life months expected credit losses discount rate rates for these loans are adjusted based on an index for most loans  the new york prime rate plus  but others the new york prime rate plus up to 
contract terms vary but  for most loans  the rate is adjusted daily 
prior to the third quarter of  contract terms on loans generally provided for rates to be adjusted annually to the new york prime rate plus 
during the fourth quarter of  the discount rate assumption was changed from to 

table of contents at december   key economic assumptions and the sensitivity of the current fair value of residual cash flows to immediate percent and percent adverse changes in those assumptions are as follows business loans fixed adjustable rate stratum in thousands except percentages prepayment speed annual rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change expected credit losses annual rate impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change discount rate annual impact on fair value of adverse change impact on fair value of adverse change during the fourth quarter of  the discount rate assumption was changed from to 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the value of the retained interest only strip receivables and servicing assets is calculated without changing any other assumption  in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another  which might magnify or counteract the sensitivities 
the above adverse changes for prepayment speed and discount rate are calculated on our retained interest only strip receivables and servicing assets on loans sold totaling  the above adverse changes for expected credit losses are calculated on the company s retained interest only strip receivables in loans sold with recourse to participating lenders and loans sold in securitizations 
the following illustrate how the changes in fair values were calculated for and adverse changes in discount rate assumptions 
effect of increases in assumed discount rate on servicing asset fixed adjustable rate stratum discount rate increase discount rate increase in thousands estimated cash flows from loan servicing fees servicing expense discount of estimated cash flows carrying value of servicing asset after effect of increases carrying value of servicing asset before effect of increases decrease of carrying value due to increase in discount rate

interest rate risk arises from the price sensitivity of investments to change in interest rates 
coupon and dividend income represents the greatest portion of an investment s total return for most fixed income instruments in stable interest rate environments 
the changes in the fair market price of such investments are inversely related to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates fall  the coupon and dividend streams of existing fixed rate investments become more valuable and the market values rise 
as interest rates rise  the opposite effect occurs 
first american s mortgage loan investments are also particularly sensitive to interest rate changes 
as long term rates fall  borrowers become more likely to refinance their mortgages causing a prepayment of outstanding mortgage principal that requires reinvestment at lower rates 
as interest rates rise  life insurance policyholders may become more likely to surrender policies or to borrow against cash values  often to meet sudden needs in an inflationary environment or to invest in higher yielding opportunities elsewhere 
this risk of disintermediation may force first life america to liquidate part of its portfolio at a time when the fair market value of fixed income investments is falling 
with loans and investments in mortgage backed securities  brooke savings bank is exposed to prepayment risk 
as interest rates decline  the rate at which these securities pay down principal will generally increase 
borrowers with fixed rate obligations are less likely than borrowers with variable rate obligations to prepay in a rising rate environment and more likely to prepay in a falling rate environment
