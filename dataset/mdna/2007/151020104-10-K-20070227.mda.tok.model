item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a global integrated biopharmaceutical company primarily engaged in the discovery  development and commercialization of innovative therapies designed to treat cancer and immune inflammatory related diseases 
our lead products are revlimid r lenalidomide  which was approved by the us food and drug administration  or fda  in december for treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes  or mds  associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities and in june for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy  and  thalomid r thalidomide  which gained fda approval in may for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients and which is also approved in erythema nodosum leprosum  an inflammatory complication of leprosy 
over the past several years  our total revenues have increased led by revlimid r and thalomid r sales growth 
this growth has enabled us to make substantial investments in research and development and thus  advance our broad portfolio of drug candidates in our product pipeline  including our imids r compounds  which are a class of compounds proprietary to us and having certain immunomodulatory and other biologically important properties 
we believe that the commercial potential of revlimid r and thalomid r  the depth of our product pipeline  near term regulatory activities and clinical data reported both at major medical conferences and in peer reviewed publications provide the catalysts for our future growth 
factors affecting future results future operating results will depend on many factors  including demand for our products  regulatory approvals of our products and product candidates  the timing and market acceptance of new products launched by us or competing companies  the timing of research and development milestones  challenges to our intellectual property and our ability to control costs 
see also the risk factors discussion contained in part i  item a 
some of the more salient factors that we are focused on include the ability of revlimid r to successfully penetrate relevant markets  our ability to advance clinical and regulatory programs and competitive risks 
the ability of revlimid r to successfully penetrate relevant markets our revlimid r launch strategy has included among other things registering physicians in the revassist r program  which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of revlimid r  partnering with contracted pharmacies to ensure  to the maximum extent possible  safe and rapid distribution of revlimid r  and  transitioning previously treated multiple myeloma patients from our expanded access program  which provided patients with free access to revlimid r  to commercial paying patients as a result of the june approval in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy 
while these initiatives appear to have resulted in a highly visible and successful product launch  we remain focused on ensuring revlimid r s continued market penetration in both multiple myeloma and mds 
we do not have long term data on the use of the product and cannot predict whether revlimid r will gain widespread acceptance  which will mostly depend on the acceptance of regulators  physicians  patients  payors and opinion leaders 
the success of revlimid r will also depend  in part  on prescription drug coverage by government health agencies  commercial and employer health plans  and other third party payors 
as an oral cancer agent  revlimid r qualifies as a medicare  part d drug 
each part d plan will review revlimid r for addition to their formulary 
as with all new products introduced into the market  there may be some lag time before being added to each plan s formulary  which may impact our commercial performance 
the ability to advance regulatory and clinical programs obtaining international regulatory approvals beginning with europe is a key component of our continued growth strategy 
we currently have two revlimid r marketing authorization applications  or maa s  under review by the european medicines agency  or emea 
the maas seek approval to market revlimid r in both multiple myeloma and mds with the q chromosomal deletion 
the timing of european approval is unpredictable 
moreover  the period of time it takes to obtain pricing and reimbursement approvals in each country could further delay our international growth strategy 
a major objective of our on going clinical programs is to broaden our knowledge about the full potential of revlimid r and our other proprietary imids r compounds and to continue to evaluate them in a broad range of hematological malignancies and other cancers 
our near term focus is on evaluating revlimid r as a treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and aggressive non hodgkin s lymphomas 
competitive risks while competition could limit revlimid r and thalomid r sales  we do not believe that competing products would eliminate their use entirely 
moreover  while generic competitors could seek to challenge our thalomid r franchise  we own intellectual property which includes  for example  us patents covering our us r distribution program for the safe distribution and appropriate use of thalidomide  which all physicians  patients and pharmacies prescribing  receiving or dispensing thalidomide in the united states must follow 
we also have exclusive rights to several issued patents covering the use of thalomid r in oncology and other therapeutic areas 
company background o in  we were spun off from celanese corporation and  in july  we completed an initial public offering 
initially  our operations involved research and development of chemical and biotreatment processes for the chemical and pharmaceutical industries 
between and  our revenues were derived primarily from the development and supply of chirally pure intermediates to pharmaceutical companies for use in new drug development 
by  sales of chirally pure intermediates became a less integral part of our strategic focus and  in january  we sold the chiral intermediates business to cambrex corporation 
o in july  we received approval from the fda to market thalomid r for the treatment and suppression of enl  an inflammatory complication of leprosy 
sales of thalomid r have grown significantly each year since then 
in  and we recorded net thalomid r sales of million  million and million  respectively 
o in april  we entered into a development and license agreement with novartis pharma ag in which we granted to novartis an exclusive worldwide license to further develop and market focalin tm  our chirally pure version of ritalin r 
the agreement provided for significant upfront and milestone payments to us based on the achievement of various stages in the regulatory approval process 
under the agreement  we sell focalin tm to novartis as well as receive royalties on all of novartis sales of focalin xr tm and ritalin r family of adhd related products 
o in august  we acquired signal pharmaceuticals  inc  d b a celgene research san diego  a privately held biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery and development of drugs that regulate genes associated with disease 
o in november  we licensed to pharmion corporation exclusive rights relating to the development and commercial use of our intellectual property covering thalidomide and steps r in all countries outside of north america  japan  china  taiwan and korea see our references below to the december amendment with respect to these territories 
o in december  we acquired anthrogenesis corp  a privately held biotherapeutics company developing processes for the recovery of stem cells from human placental tissue following the completion of a successful full term pregnancy for use in stem cell transplantation  cancer  autoimmune diseases  regenerative medicine and biomaterials for organ and wound repair 
o in march  we entered into a supply and distribution agreement with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  to distribute  promote and sell alkeran r  or melphalan  a therapy approved by the fda for the palliative treatment of multiple myeloma and carcinoma of the ovary 
the agreement requires that we purchase alkeran r from gsk and distribute the products in the united states under the celgene label 
the agreement has been extended through march  o in october  we acquired penn t limited  or penn t  a worldwide supplier of thalomid r 
through manufacturing agreements acquired in the transaction  we are able to control manufacturing for thalomid r worldwide 
in the transaction  we also acquired a product supply agreement to exclusively supply pharmion with thalidomide  thereby enabling us to increase our participation in thalidomide sales in key international markets 
subsequently  in december  we amended the thalidomide supply agreement with pharmion and granted them license rights in additional territories 
as amended  the territory licensed to pharmion is for all countries other than the united states  canada  mexico  japan and all provinces of china other than hong kong 
o in december  the fda approved revlimid r for the treatment of patients with transfusion dependent anemia due to low or intermediate risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion q cytogenetic abnormality with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities and  in june  the fda approved revlimid r for treatment in combination with dexamethasone for multiple myeloma patients who have received at least one prior therapy 
in may  we also received an additional approval from the fda to market thalomid r for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
o in november  we issued an additional  shares of our common stock at a public offering price of per share with gross proceeds of billion and proceeds  net of the underwriters discount  of billion 
o in december  we purchased an api manufacturing facility and certain assets and liabilities from siegfried located in zofingen  switzerland 
the api facility has the capability to produce multiple drug substances and initially will be used to produce revlimid r api to supply global markets 
the facility also may be used to produce drug substance for our future drugs and drug candidates

net product sales compared to revlimid r net sales recorded in related to initial stocking at certain contracted pharmacies following the product s approval on december  revlimid r net sales grew consistently each quarter in driven primarily by the additional approval in june for treatment in combination with dexamethasone of patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least one prior therapy 
also contributing to the sales growth was the impact of transitioning patients from our expanded access program  which provided patients with free access to revlimid r  to commercial paying patients 
multiple myeloma accounted for approximately of all commercial dispenses during  followed by mds  which accounted for approximately of all commercial dispenses  and a broad range of other cancer indications accounted for the remaining commercial dispenses 
in europe  we have made revlimid r available under a named patient program  or npp  which offers european patients in need access to revlimid r on a compassionate use basis while the european medicines agency  or emea  reviews our application seeking approval to market revlimid r as a treatment for multiple myeloma and mds 
npp sales totaled of total revlimid r net sales during we expect continued incremental benefit from the named patient sales leading up to a potential european approval in supported by the fda s approval of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma and newly presented data  thalomid r net sales were higher in  compared to price increases implemented as we continue to move towards a cost of therapy pricing structure as opposed to a price per milligram basis also contributed to the increase 
sales volumes decreased due to continued average daily dose declines as well as a small decrease in the total number of prescriptions 
partially offsetting the increase in thalomid r sales were higher gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and distributor chargebacks  partially offset by lower medicaid rebate accruals  which are recorded based on historical data 
alkeran r net sales were slightly higher in  compared to alkeran r sales benefited from an increase in alkeran r tablet sales volumes  as well as price increases implemented during  particularly in alkeran r ivs ie  injectables 
largely offsetting the increase in sales were higher gross to net sales accruals for sales returns and distributor chargebacks 
sales of focalin tm  which is sold exclusively to novartis and is dependent on the timing of orders from novartis for their commercial distribution  were higher in  compared to  due to increased end market demand 
compared to thalomid r net sales were higher in  as compared to  primarily due to price increases implemented as we moved towards a cost of therapy pricing structure as opposed to a price per milligram 
sales volumes decreased due to lower average daily doses  however  the total number of prescriptions for remained essentially flat when compared to the prior year period 
partially offsetting the increase in thalomid r sales were higher gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  medicaid rebates and distributor chargebacks  which are recorded based on historical data 
focalin tm net sales  which are dependent on the timing of orders from novartis for their commercial distribution  were essentially flat when compared to the prior year period 
alkeran r net sales were higher in  as compared to  due to price increases implemented during and an increase in sales volumes 
alkeran r use in combination therapies for the treatment of hematological diseases continued to grow driven by clinical data reported at major medical conferences around the world 
also contributing to the increase in alkeran r sales volumes was the resolution of supply disruptions experienced in  which resolution led to more consistent supplies of alkeran r for injection and consequently more consistent end market buying patterns 
revlimid r was approved by the fda on december  and the first commercial sales were recorded relating to initial stocking at certain contracted pharmacies that were registered under the revassist r program 
gross to net sales accruals we record gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  sales discounts  medicaid rebates and distributor charge backs and service fees 
allowance for sales returns are based on the actual returns history for consumed lots and the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned 
sales discounts accruals are based on payment terms extended to customers 
medicaid rebate accruals are based on historical payment data and estimates of future medicaid beneficiary utilization 
distributor charge back accruals are based on the differentials between product acquisition prices paid by wholesalers and lower government contract pricing paid by eligible customers covered under federally qualified programs 
distributor services accruals are based on contractual fees to be paid to the wholesale distributor for services provided

compared to sales returns allowances increased in  compared to  primarily due to unusually high thalomid r returns from one specific large retail pharmacy chain  which occurred during the first half of the returns from this customer were the results of its efforts to more aggressively manage inventory  our package configuration which required pharmacies to purchase full cartons of up to ten sleeves of thalomid r capsules with each order and steps r related restrictions  which limited the customer s ability to transfer inventories between its locations 
for the past several years  we have experienced sales returns of approximately of sales 
as a result of the higher returns activity during the first half of  we recorded additional allowances to increase our reserve to approximately of all estimated thalomid r pharmacy inventories 
in addition  we introduced single sleeve units  beginning june  rather than requiring full carton purchases and we amended our product returns policy to include a product returns handling fee 
these measures have been designed to allow customers to more effectively manage their inventories  since they can now order smaller quantities  as well as limit our product returns exposure 
also  contributing to the increase in sales returns allowances  but to a lesser extent  were higher returns of expired alkeran r iv product 
sales discounts increased in  compared to  due to higher net sales 
medicaid rebate allowances decreased in  compared to  primarily due to the impact of the new medicare  part d legislation  which became effective january  as a result of the new legislation many patients who had been eligible to receive thalomid r through medicaid coverage are now covered under medicare  part d 
partially offsetting the thalomid r decrease are medicaid rebate allowances included in for revlimid r sales 
distributor chargebacks increased in  compared to  primarily due to thalomid r price increases  which increase the differential between annual contract pricing available to federally funded healthcare providers and our wholesale acquisition cost 
also contributing to the increase in distributor chargeback allowances was an increase in alkeran r iv sales to certain public health services  or phs  contract eligible customers and an inclusion of accruals for revlimid r sales 
compared to sales returns and sales discounts allowances increased in  compared to  primarily due to higher net sales 
medicaid rebate and distributor chargeback accruals increased in  compared to  due to higher sales volumes and price increases 
as a result of thalomid r price increases  the medicaid unit rebate amount for increased as a percentage of gross product sales  as compared to the accrual for as in the case of medicaid rebate accruals  the thalomid r price increases resulted in higher distributor chargeback accruals in  as compared to other revenues compared to revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources totaled million in  compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the inclusion in of a million milestone payment received from novartis relating to the fda marketing approval for focalin xr tm 
royalty revenue totaled million in and primarily consisted of million received from novartis on sales of their entire family of ritalin r drugs and focalin xr tm 
royalty revenue was million in and included million from sales of novartis ritalin r family of drugs and focalin xr tm 
royalty revenues from novartis increased primarily due to higher focalin xr tm product sales 
compared to revenues from collaborative agreements and other sources totaled million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily due to a million milestone payment from novartis reflected in for the focalin xr tm approval while  in  we received a million milestone payment related to the focalin xr tm nda submission 
also contributing to the increase were higher pharmion collaboration related revenues in royalty revenue totaled million in and included million from sales of novartis ritalin r family of drugs and focalin xr tm  which gained fda approval on may  royalty revenue was million in and consisted primarily of royalties received from novartis strictly on sales of their ritalin r family of drugs 
cost of goods sold cost of goods sold and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands cost of goods sold    increase from prior year    percentage increase from prior year percentage of net product sales compared to cost of goods sold were higher in  compared to  primarily due to higher alkeran r costs 
alkeran r costs tend to experience variability depending on the purchase price of the specific units sold during a given period 
also contributing to the increase in cost of goods sold were higher royalties on thalomid r as a result of higher net sales and the inclusion of costs associated with revlimid r sales 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net product sales were lower in  compared to primarily due to the impact of revlimid r sales  which have a lower per unit cost than thalomid r  partially offset by higher alkeran r costs 
compared to cost of goods sold were higher in  as compared to  primarily due to higher royalties on thalomid r net sales and higher alkeran r costs as a result of higher sales volumes 
as a percentage of net product sales  cost of goods sold in were in line with research and development research and development expenses and related percentages for the years ended december   and were as follows in thousands research and development expenses    increase from prior year    percentage increase from prior year percentage of total revenue compared to research and development expenses were higher in  compared to  primarily due to higher clinical research and development expenses  which among other things support multiple programs evaluating revlimid r and other imids r across a broad range of hematological cancers  including multiple myeloma  mds  chronic lymphocytic leukemia  non hodgkin s lymphoma  myelofibrosis and hemoglobinopathies  higher medical information and education expenses  which support educating and training the medical community on hematological cancers such as multiple myeloma and mds  and higher expenses to support ongoing development of other compounds such as cc  cc  cc  cc as well as our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs and placental derived stem cell program 
included in was share based compensation expense of million resulting from the application of sfas r  which became effective january  compared to research and development expenses were higher in  as compared to  primarily due to higher costs to support further clinical development and regulatory advancement of revlimid r phase ii and phase iii programs in myelodysplastic syndromes and multiple myeloma  including the ongoing pivotal phase iii mds deletion q trial to support our maa seeking approval to market revlimid r in europe 
research and development expenses in consisted of million spent on human pharmaceutical clinical programs  million spent on other pharmaceutical programs  including toxicology  analytical research and development  drug discovery  quality and regulatory affairs  million spent on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs  and million spent on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs 
these expenditures support ongoing clinical progress in multiple proprietary development programs for revlimid r and thalomid r  and for other compounds such as cc  our lead anti inflammatory compound that inhibits pde  which results in the inhibition of multiple proinflammatory mediators such as tnf 
alpha 
and  which is currently being evaluated in phase ii clinical trials in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis  cc  cc and cc which are currently either being evaluated in healthy volunteer phase i clinical trials or for which phase ii clinical trials are planned or ongoing  and our kinase and ligase inhibitor programs as well as the placental stem cell program

in  we spent million on human pharmaceutical clinical programs  million on other human pharmaceutical programs  million on biopharmaceutical discovery and development programs  and million on placental stem cell and biomaterials programs 
as total revenue increases  research and development expense may continue to decrease as a percentage of total revenue  however the actual dollar amount may continue to increase as earlier stage compounds are moved through the preclinical and clinical stages 
due to the significant risk factors and uncertainties inherent in preclinical tests and clinical trials associated with each of our research and development projects  the cost to complete such projects can vary 
the data obtained from these tests and trials may be susceptible to varying interpretation that could delay  limit or prevent a project s advancement through the various stages of clinical development  which would significantly impact the costs incurred to bring a project to completion

this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
as the provisions of fin will be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption  the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of fin will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
this interpretation is effective for us beginning january  we are in the process of analyzing the impact of this interpretation and do not believe it will have a material impact on our results of operations 
however  we do expect to make certain balance sheet reclassifications to comply with fin in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
where applicable  this statement simplifies and codifies related guidance within generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
this accounting standard is effective for us beginning january  we have not yet determined the effect  if any  the adoption of fas may have on the our consolidated financial statements 
in february the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and  which permits a fair value re measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation 
this accounting standard is effective for us beginning january  we have not yet determined the effect  if any  the adoption of fas may have on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  or sab  which provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior period misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab provides for the quantification of the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on the current year financial statements 
sab is effective for fiscal years ending on or after november  we adopted the provisions of sab retroactive to january  and determined that it had no impact on our financial statements for the year ended december  critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operation and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition on collaboration agreements we have formed collaborative research and development agreements and alliances with several pharmaceutical companies 
these agreements are in the form of research and development and license agreements 
the agreements call for nonrefundable upfront payments  milestone payments on achieving significant milestone events  and in some cases ongoing research funding 
the agreements also contemplate royalty payments on sales if and when the compound receives fda marketing approval 
our revenue recognition policies for all nonrefundable upfront license fees and milestone arrangements are in accordance with the guidance provided in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  or sab in addition  we follow the provisions of emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  for multiple element revenue arrangements entered into or materially amended after june  eitf provides guidance on how to determine when an arrangement that involves multiple revenue generating activities or deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes  and if this division is required  how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
if the deliverables in a revenue arrangement constitute separate units of accounting according to the eitf s separation criteria  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for each identified unit 
if the arrangement is a single unit of accounting  the revenue recognition policy must be determined for the entire arrangement 
under arrangements where the license fees and research and development activities can be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting  nonrefundable upfront license fees are deferred and recognized as revenue on a straight line basis over the expected term of our continued involvement in the research and development process 
revenues from the achievement of research and development milestones  if deemed substantive  are recognized as revenue when the milestones are achieved  and the milestone payments are due and collectible 
milestones are considered substantive if all of the following conditions are met the milestone is nonrefundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved to achieve the milestone  and  the amount of the milestone appears reasonable in relation to the effort expended  the other milestones in the arrangement and the related risk associated with achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  we would recognize a proportionate amount of the milestone payment upon receipt as revenue that correlates to work already performed and the remaining portion of the milestone payment will be deferred and recognized as revenue as we complete our performance obligations 
gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  medicaid rebates and chargebacks our gross to net sales accruals for sales returns  medicaid rebates and chargebacks are based on our sales 
thalomid r is distributed under our steps r  or system for thalidomide education and prescribing safety  distribution program 
among other things  steps r  which is a proprietary comprehensive education and risk management distribution program  requires prescribers  patients and dispensing pharmacies to participate in a registry and an order cannot be filled unless the physician  patient and pharmacy have all obtained an appropriate registration number 
automatic refills are not permitted under the program 
each prescription may not exceed a day supply and a new prescription is required with each order 
although we invoice through traditional pharmaceutical wholesalers  all thalomid r orders are drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy overnight 
wholesaler stocking of this product is prohibited 
in addition  we do not offer commercial discounts on our products to pharmacies or hospitals and  therefore  have no commercial distributor chargebacks 
our chargebacks result from the difference between the wholesaler price and the lower federal ceiling price available to federally funded healthcare providers  such as veterans affairs and the us department of defense 
revlimid r is distributed under the revassist r program  which is a proprietary risk management distribution program tailored specifically to help ensure the safe use of revlimid r  and is sold primarily through contracted pharmacies lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel 
sales returns we record a sales returns allowance in the period the related product sale is recorded 
we base the allowance  which primarily relates to thalomid r sales returns  on actual returns history and known factors  such as the trend experience for lots where product is still being returned 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect future returns  then a change in the allowance would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be materially affected 
under this methodology  we track actual returns by individual production lots 
returns on closed lots  that is  lots no longer eligible for return credits  are analyzed to determine historical returns experience 
returns on open lots  that is  lots still eligible for return credits  are monitored and compared with historical return trend rates 
any changes from the historical trend rates are considered in determining the current sales return allowance 
we do not use information from external sources in estimating our product returns 
as indicated above  thalomid r is drop shipped directly to the prescribing pharmacy and  as a result  wholesalers do not stock the product 
in addition  since thalomid r has a relatively long shelf life  typically two years  short dated inventory has not historically been an issue 
revlimid r is distributed primarily through contracted pharmacies lending itself to tighter controls of inventory quantities within the supply channel and thus  resulting in lower returns activity to date 
the impact that external factors such as price changes from competitors and introductions of new and generic competing products could have on our sales returns accruals is highly judgmental and difficult to quantify 
our sales returns have not been impacted thus far by such external factors  however we continue to monitor such factors 
our sales returns allowances were million  million and million in  and  respectively  which equates to an accrual rate of  and of gross product sales in each of the three respective years 
a increase in our returns rate would have resulted in a million decrease in our reported revenue 
medicaid rebates the medicaid rebate formula  which is established by the center for medicare and medicaid services  provides for price increases based on increases in the consumer price index all urban consumers  or cpi u 
price increases in excess of the allowable increase results in a higher unit rebate amount  or ura 
our medicaid rebate accruals are computed using the medicaid ura  as determined under the medicaid rebate formula  applied to the estimated medicaid dispense quantities 
actual medicaid dispense quantities are reported by individual states on a day quarter end lag 
differences in medicaid rebate accruals resulting from differences in the estimated medicaid dispense quantities and actual medicaid dispense quantities are adjusted in the following period 
medicaid rebate allowances decreased in  compared to  primarily due to the impact of the new medicare  part d legislation  which became effective january  as a result of the new legislation many patients who had been eligible to receive thalomid r through medicaid coverage during the prior year period are now covered under medicare  part d 
partially offsetting the thalomid r decrease are medicaid rebate allowances included in the current year period for revlimid r sales 
distributor chargeback as indicated above  we do not offer commercial discounts on our products to pharmacies or hospitals and  therefore  have no commercial distributor chargebacks 
our distributor chargebacks result from the difference between the wholesaler price and the lower pricing available to federally funded healthcare providers  such as veteran affairs and the us department of defense 
we estimate distributor chargeback allowances at the time of sale based on the pharmacies to which the order was drop shipped and its eligibility for the lower pricing 
actual chargeback credits claimed by the wholesaler may significantly differ from our accruals 
distributor chargeback allowances relating to thalomid r are more sensitive to price increases and will typically increase as result of differences between annual contract pricing available to federally funded healthcare providers and our current wholesale acquisition cost 
on the other hand  revlimid r chargeback allowances are less sensitive to current wholesale acquisition cost price increases due to its relatively recent commercial launch date 
other gross to net sales accruals we record sales discounts accruals based on payment terms extended to customers and we record distributor services accruals based on contractual fees incurred for the wholesale distributor services provided 
income taxes we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for years in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse 
we provide a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
our effective tax rate is approximately 
the effective tax rate exceeds the statutory tax rate primarily due to certain expenses incurred in taxing jurisdictions outside the united states for which we do not presently receive a tax benefit and nondeductible expenses which include share based compensation expense related to incentive stock options 
we operate under an incentive tax holiday in switzerland that expires in and exempts us from certain swiss taxes 
likewise  expenses currently being incurred there do not provide a tax benefit 
to the extent we receive approvals in markets outside the united states  and manufacture and generate taxable income subject to our swiss tax holiday  we would expect our effective tax rate to be lower in the future 
at march   we determined it was more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets and as a result  eliminated certain deferred tax valuation allowances  which resulted in us recording an income tax benefit in of million and an increase to additional paid in capital of million 
the decision to eliminate the deferred tax valuation allowances was based on an external independent data monitoring committee s  or idmc  analyses of two phase iii special protocol assessment multiple myeloma trials and the conclusion that these trials exceeded the pre specified stopping rule 
the idmc found a statistically significant improvement in time to disease progression the primary endpoint of these phase iii trials in patients receiving revlimid r plus dexamethasone compared to patients receiving dexamethasone alone 
this  in concert with our nine consecutive quarters of profitability  led to the conclusion that it was more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the benefits of our deferred tax assets 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets  and reduce the carrying amount of these deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance to the extent we believe a portion will not be realized 
we consider many factors when assessing the likelihood of future realization of deferred tax assets  including our recent cumulative earnings experience by taxing jurisdiction  expectations of future taxable income  the carryforward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes  various income tax strategies and other relevant factors 
significant judgment is required in making this assessment and  to the extent future expectations change  we would have to assess the recoverability of our deferred tax assets at that time 
at december   it was more likely than not that we would realize our deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowances 
share based compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas r effective january   which requires that the cost resulting from all share based payment transactions be recognized in the financial statements at their fair values 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method under which the provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after the adoption date 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options 
management also makes decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected volatilities and the risk free interest rate used in the model 
fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been rendered that are outstanding as of the adoption date is recognized over the remaining service period after the adoption date for additional information see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
other than temporary impairments of available for sale marketable securities a decline in the market value of any available for sale marketable security below its cost that is deemed to be other than temporary results in a reduction in carrying amount to fair value 
the impairment is charged to earnings and a new cost basis for the security established 
the determination of whether an available for sale marketable security is other than temporarily impaired requires significant judgment on our part and requires consideration of available quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating the potential impairment 
our marketable securities consist primarily of debt securities whose fair value is affected by interest rate and credit rating changes 
the fair value of certain debt securities were negatively impacted by interest rate increases during if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  factors evaluated to determine whether the investment is other than temporarily impaired include significant deterioration in the issuer s earnings performance  credit rating  asset quality  business prospects of the issuer  adverse changes in the general market conditions in which the issuer operates  length of time that the fair value has been below our cost  our expected future cash flows from the security and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
assumptions associated with these factors are subject to future market and economic conditions  which could differ from our assessment 
during and  we determined that certain securities had sustained other than temporary impairments and  as a result  we recognized impairment losses of million and million in and  respectively  which were recorded in interest and investment income  net 
investment in affiliated companies our investment in entremed had a carrying value of million and a fair value of million at december  if the carrying value of our investment were to exceed its fair value  we would review it to determine whether an other than temporary decline in value of the investment has been sustained 
if the investment is determined to have sustained an other than temporary decline in value  the investment will be written down to its fair value 
such an evaluation is judgmental and dependent on the specific facts and circumstances 
factors that we considered in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred include the market value of the security in relation to its cost basis  the period of time that the market value is below cost  the financial condition of the investee and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in the market value of the investment 
we evaluate information that we are aware of in addition to quoted market prices  if any  in determining whether an other than temporary decline in value exists 
accounting for long term incentive plans we have established a long term incentive plan  or ltip  designed to provide key officers and executives with performance based incentive opportunities contingent upon achievement of pre established corporate performance objectives covering a three year period 
we currently have three year performance cycles running concurrently ending december   and the performance cycle was approved by the management compensation and development committee of the board of directors on february  and began on january  and will end on december  performance measures for the plans are based on the following components in the last year of the year cycle on earnings per share  on net income and on revenue 
payouts may be in the range of to of the participant s salary for the  and plans 
the estimated payout for the concluded plan is million and the maximum potential payout  assuming objectives are achieved at the level for the  and plans  are million  million and million  respectively 
such awards are payable in cash or  at our discretion  we can elect to pay the same value in our common stock based upon our stock price at the payout date 
we accrue the long term incentive liability over each three year cycle 
prior to the end of a three year cycle  the accrual is based on an estimate of our level of achievement during the cycle 
upon a change in control  participants will be entitled to an immediate payment equal to their target award  or  if higher  an award based on actual performance through the date of the change in control 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized expense related to the ltip of million  million and million  respectively 
accruals recorded for the ltip entail making certain assumptions concerning future earnings per share  net income and revenues  the actual results of which could be materially different than the assumptions used 
accruals for the ltip are reviewed on a regular basis and revised accordingly so that the liability recorded reflects updated estimates of future payouts 
in estimating the accruals management considers actual results to date for the performance period  expected results for the remainder of the performance period  operating trends  product development  pricing and competition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion provides forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risk 
market risk represents the potential loss arising from adverse changes in the value of financial instruments 
the risk of loss is assessed based on the likelihood of adverse changes in fair values  cash flows or future earnings 
we have established guidelines relative to the diversification and maturities of investments to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are reviewed periodically and may be modified depending on market conditions 
although investments may be subject to credit risk  our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure from any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
at december   our market risk sensitive instruments consisted of marketable securities available for sale  unsecured convertible notes issued by us and our notes payable to siegfried 
we may periodically utilize foreign currency denominated forward contracts to hedge currency fluctuations of transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency 
at december   we had one foreign currency forward contract outstanding to sell us dollars and buy british pounds for a notional amount of million 
the forward contract expires on march  and is an economic hedge of a us dollar receivable of a us foreign entity  which is remeasured through earnings each period based on changes in the spot rate 
at december   the unrealized loss on the forward contract was immaterial 
assuming that the year end exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound were to adversely change by a hypothetical ten percent  the change in the fair value of the contract would decrease by approximately million 
however  since the contract hedges a us dollar receivable of a u 
k foreign entity  any change in the fair value of the contract would be offset by a change in the underlying value of the hedged item 
marketable securities available for sale at december   our marketable securities available for sale consisted of us treasury securities  government sponsored agency securities  mortgage backed obligations  corporate debt securities  other asset backed securities and  shares of pharmion corporation common stock 
marketable securities available for sale are carried at fair value  are held for an indefinite period of time and are intended for use in meeting our ongoing liquidity needs 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities  which are deemed to be temporary  are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
the cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity 
the amortization  along with realized gains and losses  is included in interest and investment income  net 
at the end of  we determined that certain securities had sustained an other than temporary impairment due to a reduction in their future estimated cash flows and as a result  recognized a million impairment loss  which was recorded in interest and investment income  net 
as of december   the principal amounts  fair values and related weighted average interest rates of our investments in debt securities classified as marketable securities available for sale were as follows caption duration less than to to to total in thousands year years years years 
del principal amount      fair value      average interest rate del 
pharmion common stock at december   we held a total of  shares of pharmion corporation common stock  which had an estimated fair value of approximately million based on the closing price reported by the national association of securities dealers automated quotations  or nasdaq system  and  which exceeded the cost by approximately million 
the amount by which the fair value exceeded the cost ie  the unrealized gain was included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheet 
the fair value of the pharmion common stock investment is subject to market price volatility and any increase or decrease in pharmion s common stock quoted market price will have a similar percentage increase or decrease in the fair value of our investment 
convertible debt in june  we issued an aggregate principal amount of million of unsecured convertible notes 
the convertible notes have a five year term and a coupon rate of payable semi annually 
the convertible notes can be converted at any time into  shares of common stock at a stock split adjusted conversion price of per share for more information see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the fair value of the convertible notes exceeded the carrying value of million by approximately billion  which we believe reflects the increase in the market price of our common stock to per share as of december  assuming other factors are held constant  an increase in interest rates generally results in a decrease in the fair value of fixed rate convertible debt  but does not impact the carrying value  and an increase in our stock price generally results in an increase in the fair value of convertible debt  but does not impact the carrying value 
note payable at december   the fair value of our note payable to siegfried approximated the carrying value of the note of million due to the short period of time since we issued it 
assuming other factors are held constant  an increase in interest rates generally will result in a decrease in the fair value of the note 
the fair value of the note will also be effected by changes in the us dollar swiss franc exchange rate 
the note is denominated in swiss francs
