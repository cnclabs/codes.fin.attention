item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide information to assist you in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
we encourage you to read this md a in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
executive summary cephalon is an international biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the discovery  development and marketing of innovative products to treat human diseases 
we currently focus our efforts in four core therapeutic areas central nervous system cns disorders  pain  cancer and addiction 
in addition to conducting an active research and development program  we market six products in the united states and numerous products in various countries throughout europe 
consistent with our core therapeutic areas  we have aligned our person us field sales and sales management teams by area 
in europe  we have a sales and marketing organization numbering approximately persons that supports our presence in nearly european countries  including france  the united kingdom  germany  italy and spain 
our most significant product is provigil  which comprised approximately of our total consolidated net sales for the year ended december   of which approximately was in the us market 
for the year ended december   consolidated net sales of provigil increased over the year ended december  under our co promotion agreement with takeda pharmaceuticals north america  inc  takeda sales representatives began promoting provigil in the second position to primary care physicians and other appropriate health care professionals in the united states beginning july  effective january   an additional takeda sales representatives were added  all of whom are detailing provigil in the first position 
together with our cns field sales and sales management teams  we now have nearly  persons focused on detailing provigil in the united states 
our second most significant product in was actiq  which comprised approximately of our total consolidated net sales for the year ended december   of which approximately was in the us market 
in late september  barr laboratories  inc entered the us market with generic version of actiq generic otfc pursuant to our license and supply agreement 
as a result  actiq sales have been meaningfully eroded by generic otfc products sold by barr and by us through our sales agent  watson pharmaceuticals  inc  and we expect this erosion will continue during in addition  under our license and supply agreement with barr  we are obligated to sell generic otfc to barr for its resale in the united states 
while we currently have available fentanyl quota to produce actiq and generic otfc  in the future we could face shortages of quota that could negatively impact our ability to supply product to barr or to produce actiq or our generic otfc product 
if we are unable to provide product to barr  it is possible that either barr or the ftc could claim that this failure is a breach of our agreements with these parties 
during  two of our products were approved by the fda 
in late september  we received fda approval of our next generation proprietary pain product  fentora  and launched the product in the united states in early october 
fentora is indicated for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer who are already receiving and are tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain 
we are focusing our longer term clinical strategy on developing fentora for patients with breakthrough pain associated with other conditions  including neuropathic pain and back pain 
in october and january  we announced that data from phase clinical trials of fentora demonstrated efficacy in the management of breakthrough pain in opioid tolerant patients with chronic low back pain and chronic neuropathic pain  respectively 
pending positive data from an ongoing study in patients with non cancer breakthrough pain  our goal is to submit a snda to the fda in late this snda would seek to expand the labeled indications for fentora beyond breakthrough pain in patients with cancer 
in april  the fda approved vivitrol  and we launched the product in june 
vivitrol is indicated for the treatment of alcohol dependent patients who are able to abstain from alcohol in an outpatient setting and are not actively drinking when initiating treatment 
treatment with vivitrol should be used in combination with psychosocial support  such as counseling or group therapy 
under the license and collaboration agreement we signed with alkermes  inc in june  alkermes is responsible for manufacturing commercial supplies of vivitrol and we have primary responsibility for the marketing and sale of the product 
we also made progress in toward the approval of nuvigil with an anticipated indication for excessive sleepiness 
nuvigil is a single isomer version of modafinil  the active ingredient in provigil 
in may  we received an approvable letter from the fda  we currently expect a final approval decision from the fda on or before march  the fda is continuing to evaluate the single case of serious rash reported in a sparlon clinical study 
we have provided additional information to the fda to help the agency place this isolated case in the context of the safety profile for modafinil that has been established over more than a decade of commercial use 
the reviewing division has not requested any additional information related to nuvigil and is working with us to finalize the product s label 
since nuvigil is derived from the active ingredient in provigil  we expect that the safety information in the provigil label will be appropriately modified to reflect the safety information in the final nuvigil label 
nuvigil is protected by a composition of matter patent that will expire on december  and covers a novel polymorphic form of armodafinil  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in nuvigil 
in march  we announced that the fda s psychopharmacologic drugs advisory committee voted not to recommend approval of sparlon for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd in children and adolescents 
this recommendation was the result of concerns expressed by the advisory committee regarding a possible case of stevens johnson syndrome sjs  a rare but serious skin rash condition  in a child who participated in one of the phase clinical trials 
in august  we announced that the fda had issued a letter indicating that the sparlon snda was not approvable 
in light of the fda s decision  we currently are not pursuing development of sparlon 
as a biopharmaceutical company  our future success is highly dependent on obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our products and technology 
we intend to vigorously defend the validity  and prevent infringement  of our patents 
the loss of patent protection on any of our existing products  whether by third party challenge  invalidation  circumvention  license or patent expiration  could materially impact our results of operations 
in late and early  we entered into settlement agreements with each of teva pharmaceuticals usa  inc  mylan pharmaceuticals inc  ranbaxy laboratories limited and barr laboratories  inc as part of these separate settlements  we agreed to grant to each of these parties a non exclusive royalty bearing right to market and sell a generic version of provigil in the united states 
these licenses generally will become effective in april for more information concerning these settlements  please see central nervous systems disorders modafinil products and product candidates intellectual property position in part i  item of this annual report on form k 
in connection with the barr  ranbaxy and teva settlements  we also entered into a series of business arrangements related to modafinil with barr  ranbaxy and teva 
we received licenses to certain modafinil related intellectual property developed by each party and in exchange for these licenses  we agreed to make payments to these three companies collectively totaling up to million  consisting of upfront payments  milestones and royalties on net sales of our modafinil products 
in order to maintain an adequate supply of the active drug substance modafinil  we entered into agreements with three modafinil suppliers whereby we will purchase an annual minimum amount of modafinil over a six year period beginning in  with the aggregate payments over that period totaling approximately million 
our activities and operations are subject to significant government regulations and oversight 
in september  we announced that we had received subpoenas from the us attorney s office in philadelphia 
that same month  we received a voluntary request for information from the office of the connecticut attorney general 
both the subpoenas and the voluntary request for information appear to be focused on our sales and promotional practices with respect to actiq  gabitril and provigil  including the extent of off label prescribing of our products by physicians 
we are cooperating with the us attorney s office and the office of the connecticut attorney general  are providing documents and other information to both offices in response to these and additional requests and are engaged in ongoing discussions with both parties 
these matters may involve the bringing of criminal charges and fines  and or civil penalties 
we cannot predict or determine the outcome of these matters or reasonably estimate the amount or range of amounts of any fines or penalties that might result from a settlement or an adverse outcome 
however  a settlement or an adverse outcome could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
we have significant levels of indebtedness outstanding  nearly all of which consists of convertible notes 
under the terms of the indentures governing the notes  we are obligated to repay in cash the aggregate principal balance of any such notes presented for conversion 
for a more complete description of these notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
we do not have available cash  cash equivalents and investments sufficient to repay all of the convertible notes  if presented 
in addition  there are no restrictions on our use of this cash  and the cash available to repay indebtedness may decline over time 
as of december   the fair value of both the notes and the zero coupon notes is greater than the value of the shares into which such notes are convertible 
we believe that the share price of our common stock would have to significantly increase over the market price as of the filing date of this report before the fair value of the convertible notes would be less than the value of the common stock shares underlying the notes 
as such  we believe it is highly unlikely that holders of the notes or zero coupon notes will present significant amounts of such notes for conversion under the current terms 
in the unlikely event that a significant conversion did occur  we believe that we have the ability to raise sufficient cash to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand  raising money in the capital markets or selling our note hedge instruments for cash 
because the financing markets may be unwilling to provide funding to us or may only be willing to provide funding on terms that we would consider unacceptable  we may not have cash available or be able to obtain funding to permit us to meet our repayment obligations  thus adversely affecting the market price for our securities 
while we seek to increase profitability and cash flow from operations  we will need to continue to achieve growth of product sales and other revenues sufficient for us to attain these objectives 
the rate of our future growth will depend  in part  upon our ability to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection for our currently marketed products  and to successfully develop or acquire and commercialize new product candidates 
recent acquisitions and transactions for additional information related to each of the following acquisitions and transactions  please see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
co promotion agreement with takeda on june   we entered into a co promotion agreement with takeda with respect to provigil in the united states 
we also have an option to utilize the takeda sales force for the promotion of nuvigil  assuming fda approval of this product candidate 
the co promotion agreement has a three year term 
if we undergo a change of control during the three year term  we have the option to terminate the co promotion agreement  subject to our obligation to make certain specified payments to takeda 
we will pay takeda a royalty based on certain sales criteria for provigil and nuvigil during the three year term and  if specified sales levels are reached  during the three calendar years following the expiration of the co promotion agreement 
zeneus holdings limited acquisition on december   we completed our acquisition of all of the issued share capital of zeneus holdings limited 
total consideration paid in connection with the acquisition was approximately million  net of cash acquired 
trisenox acquisition on july   we completed our acquisition of substantially all assets related to trisenox from cell therapeutics  inc and cti technologies  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of cti 
the results of operations of trisenox have been included in the consolidated statements of operations since the acquisition date 
vivitrol license and collaboration in june  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with alkermes to develop and commercialize vivitrol in the united states 
concurrent with the execution of this agreement  we entered into a supply agreement under which alkermes provides to us finished commercial supplies of vivitrol 
we made an initial payment of million to alkermes upon execution of this agreement 
in april  we made an additional payment of million to alkermes following fda approval of the product 
alkermes also could receive up to an additional million in milestone payments that are contingent on attainment of certain agreed upon sales levels of vivitrol 
until december   alkermes is responsible for any cumulative losses up to million  and we are responsible for any cumulative losses in excess of million 
pre tax profit  as adjusted for certain items  and losses incurred after december  will be split equally between the parties 
we began recognizing revenue for vivitrol effective in the third quarter of in october  we amended the existing license and collaboration agreement with alkermes to provide that we would be responsible for our own vivitrol related costs during the period august  through december  and  for that period  such costs will not be chargeable to the collaboration and against the million cumulative loss cap 
the parties also agreed to amend the existing supply agreement to provide that we will purchase from alkermes two vivitrol manufacturing lines and related equipment 
at december   we incurred approximately million related to the construction of these two manufacturing lines 
we expect to incur up to an additional million for certain future capital improvements related to these two manufacturing lines 
we also have granted alkermes an option  exercisable after two years  to purchase these manufacturing lines at the then current net book value of the assets 
salmedix  inc acquisition on june   we completed our acquisition of salmedix  inc as a result of the acquisition  we obtained the rights to market treanda bendamustine hydrochloride 
the results of operations for salmedix have been included in our consolidated financial statements as of the acquisition date 
results of operations in thousands year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease united states europe total united states europe total united states europe total sales provigil gabitril cns actiq generic otfc fentora pain other total sales other revenues total revenues sales in the united states  we sell our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers  the largest three of which accounted for of our total consolidated gross sales for the year ended december  decisions made by these wholesalers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us can materially affect the level of our sales in any particular period and thus may not necessarily correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products as reported by ims health incorporated 
in  we finalized distribution service agreements with our major wholesaler customers 
these agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our products held at their warehouse locations  additionally  the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand 
as of december   we received information from substantially all of our us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our us branded products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that total inventory held at these wholesalers is approximately two weeks supply of our us branded products at our current sales levels 
during the fourth quarter of  we shipped launch quantities of our generic otfc 
at december   we believe that generic otfc inventory held at wholesalers and retailers is approximately two to three months 
sales of our generic otfc product to wholesalers and retailers include both the right of return of expired product and retroactive price reductions under certain conditions  while sales of fentora also include the right of return of expired product 
based on the sales levels and the prescription data during the fourth quarter of  and based on the number of units on hand in the pipeline at december  relative to the overall demand for the products  we have estimated and recorded all applicable product sales allowances related to generic otfc and fentora as of december  we have therefore recognized revenues for generic otfc and fentora based on a fixed and determinable sales price in for the year ended december   sales were impacted by changes in the product sales allowances deducted from gross sales as described further below and by changes in the relative levels of the number of units of inventory held at wholesalers and retailers 
for the year ended december   total sales increased by over the prior year 
the other key factors that contributed to the increase in sales are summarized by product as follows in cns  sales of provigil increased percent 
demand for provigil increased as evidenced by an increase in us prescriptions for provigil of  according to ims health 
for the year ended december   sales of provigil also were impacted by domestic price increases of approximately from period to period 
in pain  sales increased percent 
sales of actiq were impacted by an increase in domestic prices of approximately from period to period  offset slightly by a decline in demand for actiq as evidenced by a decrease in us prescriptions  according to ims health 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of revenue related to shipments of our generic otfc to barr and sales of our own generic otfc and million of revenue related to sales of fentora 
in  we expect overall sales of our pain products to decrease based on a shift in market share from actiq to generic otfc and the potential for further generic entrants into the market  partially offset by the anticipated growth in fentora 
other sales  which consist primarily of sales of other products and certain third party products  increased percent 
this increase is attributable to sales of products acquired in the trisenox and zeneus acquisitions in july and december  respectively 
other revenues the decrease of from period to period is primarily due to a decrease in partner reimbursements on our cep program  which was halted in  and a decrease in revenues from clinical studies performed for collaborators 
analysis of gross sales to net sales the following table presents the product sales allowances deducted from gross sales to arrive at a net sales figure year ended december  change change gross sales product sales allowances prompt payment discounts wholesaler discounts returns coupons medicaid discounts medicare part d discounts managed care and governmental contracts net sales product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales prompt payment discounts and returns allowances increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to the increase in sales 
wholesaler discounts decreased due to the fact that fewer incremental wholesaler discounts were required for the year ended december  as a result of price increases 
decreases in product sales allowances were also caused by lower medicaid discounts resulting from a significant number of participants transferring to the new part d of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of medicare part d program effective january  managed care and governmental contracts increased for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to additional rebates for certain managed care and governmental programs  offset by a reduction of million recognized in the third quarter of  representing amounts paid to the us department of defense dod under the tricare program from october through june  in october  the dod announced that it would reimburse all companies that had voluntarily made such payments under the tricare program due to the us court of appeals september ruling 
in the future  we expect product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales to trend upward due to the impact of potential future price increases on medicaid discounts and potential increases related to medicaid  medicare part d  managed care and governmental contracts sales 
we also recorded discounts for medicare part d for the year ended december  of million 
this reserve was established based on the number of medicare part d contracts that we have signed and an estimate of the amounts expected to be incurred under each contract based on expected enrollment and usage 
these estimates are based on preliminary data and may change significantly in the future based on actual experience 
year ended december  change change costs and expenses cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization impairment charge acquired in process research and development cost of sales the cost of sales was of net sales for the year ended december  and of net sales for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to an million inventory reserve related to sparlon recorded in the second quarter of see note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k  a million inventory reserve related to nuvigil recorded throughout as a result of fda postponement of their final approval decision until  the inclusion of zeneus product sales for the year ended december  for which the margins are lower than the average margin of our other products  as well as additional royalty expenses for the year ended december  for provigil 
these increases were partially offset by the net effect of price increases and lower product sales allowances on our three major us products 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily attributable to million of payments for four research and development collaborations and the recognition of million of stock based compensation expense representing one half of the total stock based compensation expense recorded during the year ended december  based on the employees compensation allocation as a result of the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  partially offset by lower expenses associated with reduced levels of clinical activity in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was due to higher selling and marketing costs in the united states resulting from the expansion of our sales force  increased promotional spending on provigil  vivitrol and fentora and expenses under our agreements with takeda and watson 
the increase was also due to the inclusion of zeneus selling  general and administrative expenses approximately million for the year ended december  in addition  we recognized million of stock based compensation expense representing one half of the total stock based compensation expense recorded during the year ended december  based on the employees compensation allocation as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december   primarily as a result of additional amortization expense resulting from intangible assets acquired during the last quarter of and during  and the inclusion of zeneus depreciation and amortization expenses approximately million for the year ended december  impairment charges in june  we announced that data from our phase clinical program evaluating gabitril for the treatment of generalized anxiety disorder gad did not reach statistical significance on the primary study endpoints 
we have no plans to continue further study of gabitril for the treatment of gad 
as a result  we performed a test of impairment on the carrying value of our investment in gabitril product rights and recorded an impairment charge of million in the second quarter of related to our european rights 
for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million for the write off of an intangible asset resulting from the termination of a distribution agreement in the united kingdom 
acquired in process research and development for the year ended december   we recorded acquired in process research and development expense of million for zeneus  million for salmedix and million for vivitrol

a decrease in interest expense for the year ended december  due primarily to the repurchase of substantially all of our convertible subordinated notes in july and to the write off of deferred debt issuance costs related to our notes in december and our zero coupon notes in january this decrease was partially offset by a full year of interest expense on our notes  which were issued in june a million charge resulting from the exchange of million of zero coupon notes and million of notes in december a million write off in of deferred debt issuance costs related to our zero coupon notes  as compared to a million write off in of deferred debt issuance costs related to our notes 
a million net gain on early extinguishment of debt in related to the convertible subordinated notes 
a million decrease in other income expense  net primarily due to fluctuations in foreign currency gains and losses in the comparable periods 
year ended december  change change income tax expense benefit income taxes for the year ended december   we recognized million of income tax expense on income before income taxes of million  resulting in an overall effective tax rate of percent 
this compared to income tax benefit for the year ended december  of million on loss before income taxes of million  resulting in an effective tax rate of percent 
the effective tax rate was impacted by an increase in the valuation allowance 
the effective tax rate was impacted by non deductible acquired in process research and development charges related to the salmedix and zeneus acquisitions for which no tax benefit was recorded  offset by a decrease in the valuation allowance 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for a reconciliation of the united states federal statutory rate to our effective tax rate 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease united states europe total united states europe total united states europe total sales provigil gabitril cns pain other total sales other revenues total revenues p sales in the united states  we sell our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers  the largest three of which accounted for of our total consolidated gross sales for the year ended december  decisions made by these wholesalers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us can materially affect the level of our sales in any particular period and thus may not necessarily correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products as reported by ims health 
we believe that speculative buying of product  particularly in anticipation of possible price increases  has been the historic practice of many pharmaceutical wholesalers 
in past years  we attempted to minimize these fluctuations both by providing  from time to time  discounts to our customers to stock normal amounts of inventory which we had historically defined as approximately one month s supply at our current sales level and by canceling orders if we believe a particular customer is speculatively buying inventory in anticipation of possible price increases 
in and  our wholesaler customers  as well as others in the industry  began modifying their business models from arrangements where they derive profits from the management of various discounts and rebates  to arrangements where they charge a fee for their services 
in connection with this new wholesaler business model  we finalized distribution service agreements in the third quarter of with our major wholesaler customers 
these agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our products held at their warehouse locations  additionally  the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand 
as of december   we received information from our three largest us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that total inventory held at these wholesalers is approximately two weeks supply at our current sales levels 
for the year ended december   total sales increased by over the prior year 
this change was impacted by changes in the relative levels of the number of units of inventory held at wholesalers and retailers and by changes in the product sales allowances deducted from gross sales 
the other key factors that contributed to the increase in sales are summarized by product as follows in cns disorders  sales of provigil increased percent 
demand for provigil increased as evidenced by an increase in us prescriptions for provigil of  according to ims health 
for the year ended december   sales of provigil also were impacted by domestic price increases of approximately from period to period 
sales of gabitril decreased percent 
us prescriptions for gabitril decreased according to ims health 
this decrease was driven primarily by our decision to reduce our sales and marketing efforts following an update in february to the label information for gabitril 
for the year ended december   sales of gabitril also were impacted by domestic price increases of approximately from period to period 
in pain  sales increased percent 
demand for actiq increased as evidenced by an increase in us prescriptions for actiq of  according to ims health 
for the year ended december   sales of actiq also were impacted by an increase in domestic prices of approximately from period to period 
other sales  which consist primarily of sales of other products and certain third party products  increased percent 
the most significant increases in this category are sales of products manufactured and sold to pharmaceutical partners by cima labs  which we acquired in august  sales of naxy clarithromycin  which we acquired in december and sales of trisenox which we acquired in july other revenues the increase of from period to period is primarily due to the inclusion of product development and licensing fees and royalties attributable to cima labs of million for the year ended december   compared to million from the acquisition date of august  to december  analysis of gross sales to net sales the following table presents the product sales allowances deducted from gross sales to arrive at a net sales figure year ended december  change change gross sales product sales allowances prompt payment discounts wholesaler discounts returns coupons medicaid discounts managed care and governmental contracts net sales product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales increases in the product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales from to primarily reflect the establishment of a wholesaler discount reserve in to provide for fees consistent with the terms of the distribution service agreements  increased medicaid discounts resulting from both increased usage and increased rebate percentages due to price increases  and additional rebates for certain governmental programs 
in the future  we expect product sales allowances as a percentage of gross sales to continue to trend upward due to the impact of potential future price increases on medicaid discounts and potential increases related to medicaid  managed care and governmental contracts sales 
year ended december  change change costs and expenses cost of sales research and development selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization impairment charge acquired in process research and development cost of sales the cost of sales was approximately of net sales for the year ended december  and of net sales for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due the inclusion of twelve months of cima labs product sales for which the margin is lower than our other products instead of only approximately months in this increase was also impacted by the net effect of price increases on our three major us products effective february and july and increases in our product sales allowances 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  of this increase  million is due to an increase in headcount and headcount related expenditures necessary to support higher levels of clinical activities and expenditures 
the remainder of the increase is largely due to increased research and development expenditures related to the exploration of the utility of gabitril in gad and phase studies of febt  increased research and development expenditures related to facilities and operations and the inclusion of a full year of cima labs 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in clinical research costs due to the conclusion in of four double blind studies in our nuvigil program 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   primarily due to expenditures associated with an increase in headcount  the inclusion of a full year of cima labs  which was acquired in august and increased sales and marketing costs in france to support naxy and mono naxy  which we acquired from sanofi synthelabo france in december these increases were partially offset by a reduction in gabitril marketing activity 
depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  this increase is primarily the result of increased capital investments in software  buildings  and leasehold and laboratory improvements at our west chester and frazer locations  increased spending on manufacturing equipment at our salt lake city location and the acquisition of property  plant and equipment associated with the cima labs acquisition 
amortization expense increased due to the amortization of technology  trademark and marketing rights acquired from cima labs in the third quarter of  the amortization of french marketing rights to naxy and mono naxy and the amortization of trisenox technology acquired in july impairment charges for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million for the write off of an intangible asset resulting from the termination of a distribution agreement in the united kingdom in march for the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of million for the write off of an investment in mds proteomics  inc acquired in process research and development acquired in process research and development increased million  or  for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the increase in acquired in process research and development expense in as compared to is primarily due to our acquisitions of zeneus and salmedix and the license and collaboration agreement we entered into with alkermes for vivitrol 
in  we recorded acquired in process research and development expense of million for zeneus  million for salmedix and million for vivitrol 
in  in connection with our acquisition of cima labs in august  we allocated approximately million of purchase price to in process research and development projects

this increase was partially offset by a million increase in interest expense due to higher average debt balances 
a million decrease in debt exchange expense which was recognized in related to the exchange of million of our convertible subordinated notes 
a million increase in write off of deferred debt issuance costs were recognized in related to the convertible senior subordinated notes 
a net gain charge on early extinguishment of debt of million in compared to million in the net gain in includes a million gain on the repurchase of approximately million of the convertible subordinated notes and a net loss of million on the termination of the interest rate swap agreement associated with million notional amount of the convertible subordinated notes 
the charge in relates to the repurchase of million and million of our convertible subordinated notes in private transactions in march and august  respectively 
a million increase in other income period over period primarily due to gains recorded in foreign currency transactions 
year ended december  change change income tax expense benefit income taxes for the year ended december   we recognized million of income tax benefit on a loss before income taxes of million  resulting in an overall effective tax rate of 
this compared to the year ended december  tax expense of million on a loss before income taxes of million  yielding an effective tax rate of 
the change in effective tax rates between and is primarily due to million non deductible acquired in process research and development charges related to the salmedix and zeneus acquisitions for which no tax benefit was recorded 
for tax reporting purposes  these acquisitions were treated as stock purchases 
in addition  we recorded a decrease in the valuation allowance by million and recognized a research and development tax credit of million 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash  cash equivalents and investments at december  were million  representing of total assets  as compared to million  representing of total assets  at december  and as compared to million  representing of total assets  at december  working capital is calculated as current assets less current liabilities 
our convertible subordinated notes contain conversion terms that will impact whether these notes are classified as current or long term liabilities and consequently affect our working capital position 
at december  and   million and million  respectively  of our convertible subordinated notes were convertible into cash and shares of common stock and were therefore classified as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents working capital surplus deficit the increase in cash and cash equivalents in is due to continued growth in income from product sales combined with a reduction in the use of cash and cash equivalents for investing and financing activities 
the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents during and is due primarily to significant investments in businesses  technologies and product rights 
the decrease in was partially offset by net proceeds received from our sale of convertible senior subordinated notes 
net cash provided by operating activities cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by growth in income from sales of our products offset by the timing of receipts and payments in the ordinary course of business 
while income from sales of provigil and actiq accounted for a significant portion of the growth in sales in  sales of generic otfc  fentora  trisenox and the portfolio of products obtained from the acquisition of zeneus  all of which are new sources of sales income in  also contributed to our growth in operating income over the prior year 
in and  growth in sales of provigil and actiq provided the most significant source of income from operations 
in conjunction with our acquisition of certain businesses in and  we recorded acquired in process research and development expense of million and million  respectively 
these amounts are shown in the statements of cash flows for those years as adjustments to reconcile the net loss to net cash provided by operating activities since they are reflected in investing activities as acquisition of businesses 
conversely  aggregate cash payments of million made in were recorded directly to acquired in process research and development expense and are reflected within the net loss from operations 
net cash used for investing activities cash used in investing activities primarily relates to acquisitions of business  technologies and product rights and funds invested in our administrative and manufacturing facilities to accommodate our growth 
in  we made capital expenditures of million  which included the purchase of a manufacturing line from alkermes  expenditures associated with our worldwide implementation of sap  and continued facility expansion and improvements 
the other primary use of funds for investing activities in was a payment of million made to alkermes following fda approval of vivitrol 
these uses of cash were largely offset by cash provided from sales and maturities of our investment portfolio 
in  we invested funds to acquire salmedix for million and zeneus for million  both net of cash acquired 
additionally  we purchased substantially all assets related to trisenox from cell therapeutics  inc for million and used funds to improve and expand our facilities primarily in pennsylvania  utah and france 
in  we acquired cima labs for million  net of cash acquired  and purchased the french marketing rights to naxy and mono naxy from sanofi synthelabo france for million 
we also increased our purchases of available for sale investments in order to benefit from rising interest rates on longer term investments 
net cash provided by used for financing activities financing activities for the years presented above primarily relate to proceeds and payments on long term debt and employee stock option activity 
in  we paid million in connection with our exchange of million of our outstanding convertible notes for cash and common stock and retired the remaining obligation of million of our convertible subordinated notes due december these uses of cash were largely offset by proceeds received from exercises of employee stock options 
in  we received net proceeds of million from the sale of convertible senior subordinated notes 
concurrent with the sale of the notes  we purchased a convertible note hedge for million and also sold warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds from the combined issuance of the notes  sale of warrants and purchase of convertible note hedge was partially offset by our tender offer whereby we purchased a significant portion of our convertible subordinated notes for million in cash 
during  cash used for financing activities was primarily related to the repurchase of million of then outstanding convertible subordinated notes 
commitments and contingencies legal proceedings for a complete description of legal proceedings  see note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
other commitments and contingencies the following table summarizes our obligations to make future payments under current contracts payments due by period contractual obligations total and and and thereafter debt obligations convertible notes purchase obligations capital lease obligations interest payments on debt operating leases pension obligations total contractual cash obligations at december   our notes and zero coupon notes first putable june  are considered to be current liabilities and are presented in current portion of long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
for a discussion of our obligations under our convertible notes  see outlook indebtedness below 
in addition to the above  we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our in licensing and development programs primarily in the area of research and development agreements 
payments generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable  we have not recorded a liability on our balance sheet for any such contingencies 
as of december   the potential milestone and other contingency payments due under current contractual agreements are approximately million 
outlook we expect to use our remaining cash  cash equivalents and investments for working capital and general corporate purposes  including the acquisition of businesses  products  product rights  or technologies  the payment of contractual obligations  including scheduled interest payments on our convertible notes and regulatory or sales milestones that may become due  and or the purchase  redemption or retirement of our convertible notes 
however  we expect that sales of our currently marketed products  together with sales of our near term product candidates  assuming approval in the anticipated time frames  should allow us to continue to generate positive cash flow from operations in at this time  we cannot accurately predict the effect of certain developments on the rate of sales growth in and beyond  such as the degree of market acceptance  patent protection and exclusivity of our products  the impact of competition  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and the outcome of our current efforts to develop  receive approval for and successfully launch our near term product candidates 
based on our current level of operations  projected sales of our existing products and estimated sales from our product candidates  if approved  combined with other revenues and interest income  we also believe that we will be able to service our existing debt and meet our capital expenditure and working capital requirements in the near term 
however  we cannot be sure that our anticipated revenue growth will be realized or that we will continue to generate significant positive cash flow from operations 
we may need to obtain additional funding for future significant strategic transactions  to repay our outstanding indebtedness  particularly if such indebtedness is presented for conversion by holders see indebtedness below  or for our future operational needs  and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
marketed products continued sales growth of provigil depends  in part  on the continued effectiveness of the various settlement agreements we entered into in late and early  as well as our maintenance of protection in the united states and abroad of the modafinil particle size patent through its expiration beginning in see note to the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
in addition  future growth of provigil may depend on the success of the efforts of our co promotion partner  takeda 
finally  growth of our modafinil based product sales in and beyond may depend in part on our ability to achieve final fda approval of nuvigil  which we anticipate on or before march  the growth of our pain franchise depends in large part on our ability to successfully market fentora  which we launched in the united states in october sales of our other pain product  actiq  have been meaningfully eroded by the entry of generic competition in late september and we expect this erosion will continue during in addition  sales of our own generic otfc could be significantly impacted by the entrance into the market of additional generic otfc products  which could occur at any time 
for vivitrol  our ability to achieve commercial success with this product in and thereafter will be impacted by our success in building awareness and acceptance of the product among the  addiction specialists and physicians who have been actively treating alcohol dependence with pharmacotherapy and our work towards educating the counseling community about vivitrol 
during the first few months of launch  we focused our efforts on establishing the logistical platform to effectively deliver the product to patients 
in  we will be focusing more of our sales and marketing efforts on driving product demand by educating physicians about vivitrol s benefits 
clinical studies over the past few years  we have incurred significant expenditures related to conducting clinical studies to develop new pharmaceutical products and exploring the utility of our existing products in treating disorders beyond those currently approved in their respective labels 
for  we expect to continue to incur significant levels of research and development expenditures 
we also expect to continue or begin a number of significant clinical programs including  among others our phase program evaluating treanda for the treatment of non hodgkin s lymphoma and other possible studies for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  small cell lung cancer and mantle cell lymphoma  a phase program evaluating cep for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia and other possible studies of cep in patients with myeloproliferative disorder  phase programs with fentora in non cancer breakthrough pain  and clinical programs with nuvigil in bi polar depression  cognition in schizophrenia and excessive sleepiness and fatigue in conditions such as parkinson s disease and cancer 
we may seek to mitigate the risk in our research and development programs by seeking sources of funding for a portion of these expenses through collaborative arrangements with third parties 
however  we intend to retain a portion of the commercial rights to these programs and  as a result  we still expect to spend significant funds on our share of the cost of these programs  including the costs of research  preclinical development  clinical research and manufacturing 
manufacturing  selling and marketing efforts during  we expect to continue to incur significant expenditures associated with manufacturing  selling and marketing our products 
we expect to continue in process capital expenditure projects at our research and development facilities in france and west chester 
the aggregate amount of our sales and marketing expenses in also will be significantly higher than that incurred in  primarily as a result of higher expenses associated with our promotional efforts related to provigil and fentora 
indebtedness we have significant indebtedness outstanding  consisting principally of indebtedness on convertible subordinated notes 
the following table summarizes the principal terms of our most significant convertible subordinated notes outstanding as of december  security outstanding in millions conversion price redemption rights and obligations convertible senior subordinated notes due june the notes generally not redeemable by the holder prior to december zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  the zero coupon notes redeemable on june  at either option of holder or us at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
zero coupon convertible notes due june  first putable june  the zero coupon notes redeemable on june  at either option of holder or us at a redemption price of of the principal amount redeemed 
stated conversion prices as per the terms of the notes 
however  each convertible note contains certain terms restricting a holder s ability to convert the notes  including that a holder may only convert if the closing price of our stock on the day prior to conversion is higher than  or with respect to the notes  the zero coupon notes or the zero coupon notes  respectively 
for a more complete description of these notes  including the associated convertible note hedge  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
in december  certain holders of our zero coupon notes and notes approached us and we agreed to exchange million aggregate principal amount of our convertible notes for cash payments totaling million and the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
concurrent with these exchanges  we amended our convertible note hedge agreements related to the zero coupon notes and notes and amended the warrant agreements related to the zero coupon notes 
the effect of these amendments was to terminate the portion of the convertible note hedge and  with respect to the zero coupon notes  the warrants agreements related to the million principal amount of notes exchanged 
in settlement of these amendments  we received million shares of our common stock from the counterparties to these agreements 
the warrants related to the notes exchanged in december remain outstanding 
our and zero coupon notes are convertible as of december  and  under the terms of the indentures governing the notes  we are obligated to repay in cash the aggregate principal balance of any such notes presented for conversion 
as of the filing date of this annual report on form k  we do not have available cash  cash equivalents and investments sufficient to repay all of the convertible notes  if presented 
in addition  there are no restrictions on our use of this cash and the cash available to repay indebtedness may decline over time 
if we do not have sufficient funds available to repay any principal balance of notes presented for conversion  we will be required to raise additional funds 
because the financing markets may be unwilling to provide funding to us or may only be willing to provide funding on terms that we would consider unacceptable  we may not have cash available or be able to obtain funding to permit us to meet our repayment obligations  thus adversely affecting the market price for our securities 
as of december   our notes and zero coupon notes are convertible because the closing price of our common stock on that date was higher than the restricted conversion prices of these notes 
as a result  the notes and zero coupon notes have been classified as current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for summary of our convertible debt  note hedge and call warrant 
as of february   the fair value of both the notes and zero coupon notes is greater than the value of the shares into which such notes are convertible 
we believe that the share price of our common stock would have to significantly increase over the market price as of the filing date of this report before the fair value of the convertible notes would be less than the value of the common stock shares underlying the notes and  as such  we believe it is highly unlikely that holders of the notes or zero coupon notes will present significant amounts of such notes for conversion under the current terms 
in the unlikely event that a significant conversion did occur  we believe that we have the ability to raise sufficient cash to repay the principal amounts due through a combination of utilizing our existing cash on hand  raising money in the capital markets or selling our note hedge instruments for cash 
the annual interest payments on our convertible notes outstanding as of december  are million  payable semi annually on june and december in the future  we may agree to exchanges of the notes for shares of our common stock or debt  or may determine to use a portion of our existing cash on hand to purchase or retire all or a portion of the outstanding convertible notes 
our notes and and zero coupon notes each are considered instrument c securities as defined by emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 convertible bonds with issuer option to settle for cash upon conversion eitf  therefore  these notes are included in the dilutive earnings per share calculation using the treasury stock method 
under the treasury stock method  we must calculate the number of shares issuable under the terms of these notes based on the average market price of our common stock during the period  and include that number in the total diluted shares figure for the period 
at the time we sold our notes and zero coupon notes we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements that together are intended to have the economic effect of reducing the net number of shares that will be issued upon conversion of the notes by increasing the effective conversion price for these notes  from our perspective  to and  respectively 
however  from a us gaap perspective  sfas no 
 earnings per share sfas considers only the impact of the convertible notes and the warrant agreements  since the impact of the convertible note hedge agreements is always anti dilutive  sfas requires that we exclude from the calculation of fully diluted shares the number of shares of our common stock that we would receive from the counterparties to these agreements upon settlement 
under the treasury stock method  changes in the share price of our common stock can have a significant impact on the number of shares that we must include in the fully diluted earnings per share calculation 
the following table provides examples of how changes in our stock price will require the inclusion of additional shares in the denominator of the fully diluted earnings per share calculation total treasury stock method incremental shares 
the table also reflects the impact on the number of shares we could expect to issue upon concurrent settlement of the convertible notes  the warrant and the convertible note hedge incremental shares issued by cephalon upon conversion share price convertible notes shares warrant shares total treasury stock method incremental shares shares due to cephalon under note hedge incremental shares issued by cephalon upon conversion represents the number of incremental shares that must be included in the calculation of fully diluted shares under us gaap represents the number of incremental shares to be issued by us upon conversion of the convertible notes  assuming concurrent settlement of the convertible note hedges and warrants 
acquisition strategy as part of our business strategy  we plan to consider and  as appropriate  make acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies 
our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to issue stock or raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete future transactions 
in addition  as a result of our acquisition efforts  we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses whether or not our efforts are successful that may include transaction costs  closure costs or acquired in process research and development charges 
other we may experience significant fluctuations in quarterly results based primarily on the level and timing of cost of product sales  achievement and timing of research and development milestones  collaboration revenues  cost and timing of clinical trials  regulatory approvals and product approvals  marketing and other expenses  manufacturing or supply disruptions  and costs associated with the operations of recently acquired businesses and technologies 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which we have prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing these financial statements  we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we develop and periodically change these estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and most demanding of their judgment 
management considers the following policies to be critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements and the uncertainties associated with the complex judgments made by us that could impact our results of operations  financial position and cash flows 
revenue recognition in the united states  we sell our products to pharmaceutical wholesalers  the largest three of which account for of our total consolidated gross sales for the year ended december  decisions made by these wholesalers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us may have materially affected the level of our sales in any particular period and thus our sales may not correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products as reported by ims health 
we have distribution service agreements with our major wholesaler customers 
these agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our products held at their warehouse locations  additionally  the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand 
product sales are recognized upon the transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product to the customer 
in the united states  we sell all commercial products fob shipping point 
transfer of ownership and risk of loss for the product pass to the customer at the point that the product is picked up by a common carrier for shipment to the customer 
in europe  product sales are recognized predominantly upon customer receipt of the product  except in certain contractual arrangements where different terms may be specified 
payments under co promotional or managed services agreements are recognized over the period when the products are sold or the promotional activities are performed 
the portion of the payments that represent reimbursement of our expenses is recognized as an offset to those expenses in our results of operations 
we recognize revenue on new product launches when sales returns can be reasonably estimated and all other revenue recognition requirements have been met 
when determining if returns can be estimated  we consider actual returns of similar products as well as sales returns with similar customers 
in cases in which a new product is not an extension of an existing line of product or where we have no history of experience with products in a similar therapeutic category such that we can not estimate expected returns of the new product  we defer recognition of revenue until the right of return no longer exists or until we have developed sufficient historical experience to estimate sales returns 
in developing estimates for sales returns  we consider inventory levels in the distribution channel  shelf life of the product and expected demand based on market data and prescriptions 
as of december   we received information from substantially all of our us wholesaler customers about the levels of inventory they held for our us branded products 
based on this information  which we have not independently verified  we believe that total inventory held at these wholesalers is approximately two weeks supply of our us branded products at our current sales levels 
during the fourth quarter of  we shipped launch quantities of our generic otfc 
at december   we believe that generic otfc inventory held at wholesalers and retailers is approximately two to three months 
sales of our generic otfc product to wholesalers and retailers include both the right of return of expired product and retroactive price reductions under certain conditions  while sales of fentora also include the right of return of expired product 
based on the sales levels and the prescription data during the fourth quarter of  and based on the number of units on hand in the pipeline at december  relative to the overall demand for the products  we have estimated and recorded all applicable product sales allowances related to generic otfc and fentora as of december  we have therefore recognized revenues for generic otfc and fentora based on a fixed and determinable sales price in sales of our generic otfc product could be subject to retroactive price reductions for units that remain in the pipeline if the price of generic otfc is reduced  including as a result of another generic entrant into the market  and as a result any estimated impact of such adjustments is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
this estimate of both the potential timing of a generic entrant and the amount of the price reduction is highly subjective 
at december   we are not aware of any expected additional entrants into the generic otfc market that would result in a price reduction to customers for inventory already purchased from us  and do not believe that any revenue recognized as of december  would be effected by a retroactive shelf stock adjustment 
if an additional generic entrant had occurred at the beginning of the first quarter on january   and generic otfc prices were reduced by  then a reduction of our reported revenues of million would result 
we utilize watson as our sales agent for the sales and distribution of our generic otfc 
we pay our sales agent a commission for these services and record this commission as sg a expense 
product sales allowances we record product sales net of the following significant categories of product sales allowances prompt payment discounts  wholesaler discounts  returns  coupons  medicaid discounts and managed care and governmental contracts 
in addition to these product sales allowances  in the first quarter of we also began recording an allowance to product sales for medicare part d discount reserves 
calculating each of these items involves significant estimates and judgments and requires us to use information from external sources 
prompt payment discounts we offer our us wholesaler customers a prompt pay cash discount as an incentive to remit payment within the first thirty five days after the date of the invoice 
prompt pay discount calculations are based on the gross amount of each invoice 
we account for these discounts by reducing sales by the discount amount when product is sold  and apply earned cash discounts at the time of payment 
since we began selling our products commercially in  our customers have routinely taken advantage of this discount 
based on common industry practices and our customers overall payment performance  we accrue for cash discounts on all us sales recorded during the period 
we adjust the accrual to reflect actual experience as necessary and  as a result  the actual amount recognized in any period may be slightly different from our accrual amount 
wholesaler discounts during  we finalized distribution service agreements with a number of our wholesaler customers that provide our wholesalers with the opportunity to earn up to in additional discounts in exchange for the performance of certain services 
these agreements are effective from january  we have therefore recorded a provision equal to of us gross sales for the twelve months ended december   less inventory appreciation adjustments for price increases 
in addition  at our discretion  we may provide additional discounts to wholesalers such as the discounts of million that were provided and recorded during the first quarter of and the additional discount offered to wholesalers on initial stocking orders of fentora 
actual discounts provided could therefore exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected discounts 
if these discounts were to increase by of gross sales from our six products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
returns customers can return short dated or expired product that meets the guidelines set forth in our return goods policy 
product shelf life from the date of manufacture for provigil is years  gabitril is to years  depending on product strength  and actiq and fentora are each years 
returns are accepted from wholesalers and retail pharmacies 
wholesaler customers can return short dated product with six months or less shelf life remaining and expired product within twelve months following the expiration date 
retail pharmacies are not permitted to return short dated product but can return full or partial quantities of expired product only within twelve months following the expiration date 
we base our estimates of product returns for each of our products on the percentage of returns that we have experienced historically 
notwithstanding this  we may adjust our estimate of product returns if we are aware of other factors that we believe could meaningfully impact our expected return percentages 
these factors could include  among others  our estimates of inventory levels of our products in the distribution channel  known sales trends and existing or anticipated competitive market forces such as product entrants and or pricing changes 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for returns at a weighted average rate of of gross sales  which is consistent with our actual historical return percentages 
the other factors described above did not have a significant impact for the year ended december  on our estimate of product returns 
actual returns could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future returns activity because of several factors  including  among other things  wholesaler and retailer stocking patterns and or competition 
if the returns provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our six products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
based on fourth quarter sales  we believe a reasonable estimate of our maximum exposure for potential returns related to product in our total supply pipeline as of december  is approximately million for provigil  million for actiq  million for generic otfc  million for fentora and million for gabitril 
coupons we offer patients the opportunity to obtain free samples of our products through a program whereby physicians provide coupons to qualified patients for redemption at retail pharmacies 
we reimburse retail pharmacies for the cost of these products through a third party administrator 
we recognize the estimated cost of this reimbursement as a reduction of gross sales when product is sold 
in addition  we maintain an accrual for unused coupons based on inventory in the distribution channel and historical coupon usage rates and adjust this accrual whenever changes in such coupon usage rates occur 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for coupons at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual coupon usage could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future coupon activity 
if the coupons provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our six products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
medicaid discounts we record accruals for rebates to be provided through governmental rebate programs  such as the medicaid drug rebate program  as a reduction of sales when product is sold 
these reductions are based on historical rebate amounts and trends of sales eligible for these governmental programs for a period  as well as any expected changes to the trends of our total product sales 
in addition  we estimate the expected unit rebate amounts to be used and adjust our rebate accruals based on the expected changes in rebate pricing 
rebate amounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for medicaid discounts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual medicaid discounts could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future medicaid patient activity or unit rebate amounts 
if the medicaid discounts provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our six products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
medicare part d discounts beginning in  we have entered into agreements with certain customers covered under part d of the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of whereby we provide agreed upon discounts to such entities based on formulary positioning 
we record accruals for these discounts as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on the discount rates and expected levels of sales volume of these customers during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on expected amounts and trends of sales by these entities and on any expected changes to the trends of our product sales 
discounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for medicare part d discounts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual medicare part d discounts could exceed our estimates of expected future medicare patient activity or unit rebate amounts 
if the medicare part d discounts provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our six products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
managed care and governmental contracts we have entered into agreements with certain managed care customers whereby we provide agreed upon discounts to such entities based on market share 
we record accruals for these discounts as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on the discount rates and expected levels of market share of these managed care customers during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical amounts and trends of sales by these entities and on any expected changes to the trends of our product sales 
discounts are generally invoiced and paid quarterly in arrears  so that our accrual consists of an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s activity  plus an accrual for prior quarters unpaid rebates and an accrual for inventory in the distribution channel 
we have entered into agreements with certain governmental customers other than medicaid whereby we provide legislatively mandated discounts and rebates to such entities 
we record accruals for these discounts and rebates as a reduction of sales when product is sold based on the discount amounts and expected levels of performance of these governmental customers during a period 
we estimate eligible sales based on historical sales amounts and trends of sales by these entities and on any expected changes to the trends of our product sales 
generally  discounts are granted to governmental customers by our wholesalers at time of purchase 
in other cases  rebates are paid directly to governmental customers based on reported levels of patient usage 
wholesalers charge these discounts and rebates back to us generally within one to three months 
we record accruals for our estimate of unprocessed chargebacks related to sales made during the period based on an estimate of the amount expected to be incurred for the current quarter s sales  plus an accrual based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel 
we recognized a reduction in the managed care and governmental contracts allowance of million in the third quarter of  representing amounts paid to the dod under the tricare program from october through june  in october  the dod announced that it would reimburse all companies that had voluntarily made such payments under the tricare program due to the us court of appeals september ruling and we received this reimbursement in december for the year ended december   we recorded a provision for managed care and governmental contracts at a weighted average rate of of gross sales 
actual chargebacks and rebates could exceed historical experience and our estimates of expected future participation in these programs 
if the chargebacks and rebates provision percentage were to increase by of gross sales from our six products marketed in the us  then an additional provision of million would result 
the following table summarizes activity in each of the above categories for the years ended december  and in thousands prompt payment discounts wholesaler discounts returns coupons medicaid discounts medicare part d discounts managed care governmental contracts total balance at january  provision current period prior periods total actual current period prior periods total balance at december  provision current period prior periods total actual current period prior periods total balance at december  given our return goods policy  we assume that all returns in a current year relate to prior period sales 
includes beginning reserve balances related to trisenox  which was acquired in the third quarter of  of million for prompt payment discounts and million for returns 
includes million related to the dod tricare program of which million related to the current period and million related to prior periods 
inventories our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  and include the cost of raw materials  labor  overhead and shipping and handling costs 
cost is computed on domestic inventories and certain of our foreign inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
for the majority of our foreign inventories  the first in  first out fifo method is utilized 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we regularly evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in our opinion  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  we establish a reserve against the inventories carrying value 
our determination that a valuation reserve might be required  in addition to the quantification of such reserve  requires us to utilize significant judgment 
we base our analysis  in part  on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements for forecasted product demand and the expiration dates of inventories 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated decreases in demand could have a material impact on the carrying value of our inventories and our reported operating results 
to date  inventory adjustments have not been material 
we expense pre launch inventory unless it is probable that the inventory will be saleable 
we have capitalized inventory costs associated with marketed products and certain products prior to regulatory approval and product launch  based on management s judgment of probable future commercial use and net realizable value 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval or pre launch inventory upon a change in such judgment  due to a denial or delay of approval by regulatory bodies  a delay in commercialization  or other potential factors 
at december   we had million of capitalized inventory costs related to nuvigil  net of reserves of million  as we do not expect that certain batches in inventory will be sold prior to their expiration date 
at december   we had an million inventory reserve related to the fda s determination that the sparlon snda was not approvable see note of the consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
at december   we had million  million and million of capitalized inventory costs related to nuvigil  sparlon and other pre launch products  respectively 
we have committed to make future minimum payments to third parties for certain raw material inventories 
the minimum purchase commitments total million as of december   the majority of which relate to modafinil and armodafinil 
we expect to fully utilize these contracts 
valuation of property and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill and investments our property and equipment have been recorded at cost and are being depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of those assets 
we regularly assess our property and equipment  intangible assets  goodwill and other long lived assets to determine whether any impairment in these assets may exist and  if so  the extent of such impairment 
to do this  in the case of goodwill we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units and compare it to the book value of their net assets 
in the case of intangibles and other long lived assets  we assess whether triggering events have occurred and if so  we compare the estimated cash flows of the related asset group and compare it to the book value of the asset group 
calculating fair value as well as future cash flows requires that we make a number of critical legal  economic  market and business assumptions that reflect our best estimates as of the testing date 
we believe the methods we use to determine these underlying assumptions and estimates are reasonable and reflective of common practice 
notwithstanding this  our assumptions and estimates may differ significantly from actual results  or circumstances could change that would cause us to conclude that an impairment now exists or that we previously understated the extent of impairment 
for additional information regarding our significant accounting policies with respect to goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets  see note of our consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
income taxes we provide for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax and financial reporting bases of assets and liabilities 
we provide for income taxes at a rate equal to our estimated annual combined federal  state and foreign statutory effective rates 
subsequent adjustments to our estimates of our ability to recover the deferred tax assets or other changes in circumstances or estimates could cause our provision for income taxes to vary from period to period  as it has for the current year ended december  based on our profitability for the year ended december   projected future results  and resolution of several generic challenges  during the fourth quarter of we concluded that it was likely that a significant portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
therefore  we again reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance 
at december   we retained a valuation allowance of million  against a total deferred tax asset balance of million  composed entirely of state and foreign net operating losses  and state tax credits 
we will continue to review and analyze the likelihood of realizing tax benefits related to deferred tax assets as there is more certainty surrounding our future levels of profitability related to specific company operations and the related taxing jurisdictions 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method  in which compensation cost was recognized based on the requirements of sfas r for a all share based payments granted after the effective date and b for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
sfas r requires the use of judgment and estimates in performing multiple calculations 
we estimate the fair value using the black scholes option pricing model when assessing the fair value of stock options granted 
the black scholes option pricing model requires several inputs  one of which is volatility 
the fair value of stock options is most sensitive to the volatility input 
our estimate of volatility is based upon the historical volatility experienced in our stock price as well as the implied volatility from publicly traded stock options on our stock 
to the extent volatility of our stock price or the option market on our stock increases in the future  our estimates of the fair value of stock options granted in the future could increase  thereby increasing stock based compensation expense in future periods 
for instance  an increase in estimated volatility of ten percentage points would have resulted in additional annual pre tax stock based compensation expense of approximately million for the year ended december  in addition  we apply an expected forfeiture rate when amortizing stock based compensation expense 
our estimate of the forfeiture rate is based primarily upon historical experience of employee turnover 
to the extent we revise this estimate in the future or actual experience differs from this estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
an estimated forfeiture rate of one percentage point lower would have resulted in an insignificant increase in stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  our expected term of stock options granted was derived from the average midpoint between vesting and the contractual term  as described in sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 share based payment 
in the future  as information regarding post vesting termination becomes more accessible  we may change our method of deriving the expected term 
this change could impact our fair value of stock options granted in the future 
we expect to refine our method of deriving expected term no later than january  recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in the tax return 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the effect the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated financial statements  but we do not expect it to be significant

   and r sfas 
sfas requires the recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan other than a multiemployer plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position  the measurement of a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year and the recognition of changes in that funded status in the year in which the changes occur through comprehensive income 
we adopted sfas effective december  our retirement plans are unfunded and our unrecognized gains or losses  prior service costs or credits  and transition assets or obligations at december  were not significant 
in september  the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the rollover method and the iron curtain method 
the rollover method focuses primarily on the impact of a misstatement on the income statement including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
sab is effective for any report for an interim period of the first fiscal year ending after november  we believe the adoption of this bulletin effective january  will have no impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk related to our operations in european subsidiaries that have transactions  assets  and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are translated into us dollars for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
historically  we have not hedged any of these foreign currency exchange risks 
for the year ended december   an average weakening of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which our european subsidiaries operate would have resulted in an increase of million in reported total revenues and a corresponding increase in reported expenses 
this sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not assume any changes in the level of operations of our european subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates to our investment portfolio  since all of our outstanding debt is fixed rate 
our investments are classified as short term and as available for sale 
we do not believe that short term fluctuations in interest rates would materially affect the value of our securities
