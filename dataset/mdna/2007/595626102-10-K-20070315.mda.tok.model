retail operations consist of franchised and company operated midas shops in north america and licensed midas shops in other countries 
supply chain activities include providing value added merchandising services to franchisees in which the company establishes relationships with vendors who distribute products and equipment directly to midas shops 
real estate activities include the development  ownership and leasing of midas shops in north america 
midas retail locations had historically operated as under car specialists focused on the replacement of exhaust  brakes  and shocks and struts 
as recently as  exhaust and brake repair services constituted of midas retail shop revenues in the us market 
as automobile manufacturers began to employ non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems in the mid s  the average life of an original equipment exhaust system began to increase from three years to over years 
as a result  beginning in the mid s  midas core exhaust replacement business began to experience sustained revenue declines 
this trend  combined with the increased technological complexity and durability of newer vehicles  has changed the nature of automotive repairs 
today  the services performed over the lifetime of a vehicle are more likely to be maintenance services and light repair work 
in response to these trends  the company began to broaden its service menu in  with the purpose of transforming itself from an under car specialist to a full service automotive repair and maintenance provider  leveraging midas strong brand name and nationwide presence 

table of contents in addition to managing the global midas retail system  the company historically distributed brake  shock  strut and other automotive parts to its dealers in north america through a network of automotive parts warehouses 
midas also manufactured and distributed exhaust products and equipment to midas dealers and independent exhaust distributors 
however  the dramatic decline in the retail exhaust business coupled with the broadening services menu and the emergence of quick delivery parts suppliers caused retail auto service providers  including midas dealers  to gradually reduce their investments in parts inventories within their shops  preferring to source required auto parts only at the time the part was needed for a specific customer 
as a result of these trends  the company s revenue from the wholesale distribution of parts declined and midas wholesale distribution and exhaust manufacturing operations became unprofitable 
in fiscal  midas management redirected the company s strategic focus towards the core midas retail operations 
during that year  the company shut down its network of parts distribution warehouses and outsourced parts distribution on behalf of midas dealers in the us and canada 
in fiscal  the company ceased production at its hartford  wisconsin exhaust manufacturing facility and began the process of liquidating all assets related to its exhaust manufacturing and distribution operation

the midas business transformation during fiscal  midas developed and began to implement a plan to dramatically restructure the company s operations and re direct the company s strategic focus towards the midas retail system 
this plan was intended to transform the company by improving profitability  enhancing the competitive position of the midas retail system  strengthening the company s balance sheet and reducing future capital requirements 
this transformation encompasses fundamental changes in the way midas dealers are supplied with midas brand products and other replacement auto parts  a re definition of the service relationship between midas dealers and their customers  and a shift in the way the company approaches its relationship with midas franchisees 
during  the company outsourced the wholesale distribution of midas brand products and other replacement parts  closed all but one of the company s regional distribution centers  disposed of its pwi quick delivery distribution locations through sale or closure  closed or re franchised company operated shops  and significantly reduced corporate administrative overhead 
in connection with the company s ongoing transformation  management determined that exhaust manufacturing and distribution no longer represented a strategic fit for the company s evolving retail focused business model 
in may  the company entered into new exhaust supply arrangements with its vendors  which allowed the company to exit its unprofitable exhaust manufacturing and distribution business 
as a result of these agreements  midas ceased production at its hartford  wisconsin exhaust manufacturing plant during the third quarter of fiscal midas continued to operate its exhaust distribution warehouse in chicago  illinois during the first quarter of in order to provide midas brand exhaust products to certain midas dealers prior to their final conversion to the new exhaust supply program 
during the first quarter of fiscal  all remaining exhaust inventory and equipment was sold and liquidated and the chicago exhaust distribution warehouse was closed 
in connection with the above described business transformation activities  the company recorded business transformation charges of approximately million from fiscal through the company s recently completed exit from exhaust manufacturing and distribution has further reduced overall company revenues and expenses compared to historical levels  but has increased the company s operating margin 
the company s vacant hartford  wi factory is the one asset that remains from the former exhaust manufacturing and distribution operation 
midas is currently seeking buyers for this facility and expects to ultimately record a gain upon the sale of this facility 

table of contents the midas business transformation  and the resulting changes to the way the company does business  continued in in the fourth quarter  the company closed six unprofitable company operated shops and re franchised three shops 
the company recorded charges of approximately million in connection with these actions 
additionally  in connection with midas ongoing retail transformation  the company recently began the rollout of a major update to its retail shop image 
the new image program incorporates changes to internal shop appearance and merchandising  as well as a significant redesign of the midas shop fa ade 
midas management believes the new image will better showcase the company s expansion into new services  enhance efforts to educate customers and significantly increase the visibility and curb appeal of the typical midas shop 
the company expects a majority of midas shops throughout north america to adopt the new shop image 
in order to encourage midas dealers to adopt this new image  the company has offered to provide a subsidy of up to  per shop for those franchisees who adopt the program prior to the end of fiscal approximately million in business transformation costs were recorded in fiscal in connection with this program and the company expects to record additional business transformation costs each quarter during midas believes the total charges for franchised locations will be approximately million 
the implementation of these business transformation initiatives has had the effect of substantially lowering overall company revenues and expenses in fiscal compared to historical periods 
furthermore  the implementation of the company s strategic initiatives has resulted in the company recording substantial business transformation charges to reflect the write down of assets  the disposition of lease agreements  severance costs  and other related expenses

this includes both comparable shop sales growth at existing midas locations and growth in overall shop count 
in addition  midas management believes that the company s brand name and system management expertise can be leveraged to generate incremental royalty revenue through growth of the midas system around the world 
this includes expansion into china  which management believes is positioned to become the world s largest automotive market 
however  the company s franchising business model generates substantial operating cash flow with relatively low ongoing capital investment requirements 
furthermore  the future growth of the midas retail system does not necessarily depend upon the company making significant capital investments or adding additional corporate overhead 
thus  midas management believes that it can also create shareholder value by efficiently allocating capital towards complementary franchising business acquisitions and repurchasing the company s stock 
these strategies for creating shareholder value are described in greater detail below

in fiscal  the company re defined the core services of the midas system to encompass exhaust  brakes and maintenance services 
this significantly expanded the revenue potential of the core midas system business model 
in fiscal  midas successfully launched a major retail initiative to significantly expand midas shop sales of tires and related tire services 
the typical midas shop in the us currently derives only of its revenues from tires and related services  but management believes that the typical midas shop can ultimately generate of its revenue from the category 
during fiscal  the company rolled out a series of initiatives to enhance the midas system s ability to build revenue from retail maintenance services 
these initiatives included the standardization of the midas oil change service and vehicle inspection process  providing all customers with factory maintenance schedules and increasing the midas shop s focus and capabilities in fluid exchange services 
as a result  maintenance services have risen to approximately of total shop sales and management believes the growth in maintenance services will continue 
most recently  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company launched a comprehensive program for increasing revenue from local and national fleet services 
currently  midas generates only of retail revenue in the us from fleet operations 
midas management believes the company s nationally respected brand name and national presence will enable it to meaningfully grow retail revenues from fleet in the next two years 
in connection with midas retail business model transformation  the company has developed a major update to the company s shop image 
the new image program was based on extensive customer research and incorporates changes to internal shop appearance and merchandising  as well as a significant redesign of the midas shop fa ade

consequently  midas has developed a package of incentives to promote independent shop conversions 
finally  the company is also considering the targeted acquisition of independent general auto repair operations as a means to accelerating growth in shop count 
the lead time for a new shop development can be up to months  thus the company s efforts to open new midas shops are only now beginning to become evident

nevertheless  midas international licensees have continued to invest in their operations and grow 
midas international shop count has grown every year since  with the international shop count increasing from shops in to shops in  even though the number of countries in which the company operates has not grown during that time

such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied  the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates  and the consistent application of those accounting principles 
due to the type of industry in which the company operates and the nature of its business  and the company s existing business transformation process  the following accounting policies are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents valuation of warranty liabilities customers are provided a written warranty from midas on certain midas products purchased from midas shops in north america  namely brake friction  mufflers  shocks and struts 
the warranty will be honored at any midas shop in north america and is valid for the lifetime of the vehicle  but is voided if the vehicle is sold 
the company maintains a warranty accrual to cover the estimated future liability associated with outstanding warranties 
the company determines the estimated value of outstanding warranty claims based on an estimate of the percentage of all warranted products sold and registered in prior periods at retail that are likely to be redeemed  and an estimate of the cost of redemption of each future warranty claim on a current cost basis 
these estimates are computed using actual historical registration and redemption data as well as actual cost information on current redemptions 
an increase of one percentage point in the estimated percentage of warranted products likely to be redeemed in the us would have the effect of changing midas december  outstanding us warranty liability by approximately million 
a change in the estimated current cost of warranty redemptions of one dollar would have the effect of changing midas outstanding us warranty liability by million 
valuation of receivables the company records receivables due from its franchisees and other customers at the time the sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
these receivables consist of amounts due from the sale of products  royalties due from franchisees and suppliers  rents and other amounts 
the future collectibility of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it feels may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables and by monitoring the financial strength of its franchisees and other customers 
where the company becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg where it is in financial distress or has filed for bankruptcy  the company specifically reserves for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of receivables is performed on a quarterly basis

the company s funding policy for the us plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate

amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss consist of unrecognized actuarial gains  losses  and prior service costs  net of tax 
as of december   the million prepaid pension cost  net of valuation reserves of approximately million pertaining to the partial wind up of the canadian salaried pension plan and the full wind up of the canadian hourly pension plan  was recorded in the company s balance sheet as a million prepaid asset and a million accrued pension liability 
to account for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 the company must make three main determinations at the end of each fiscal year first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments and periodic published rate ranges 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the discount rates used by year 

table of contents second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for rates of increase in compensation levels used in the calculation of the accumulated and projected benefit obligations for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
in determining this rate the company looks at its historical and expected rates of annual salary increases 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the rates of increase in compensation levels used by year 
third  the company must determine the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption that is used to determine the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is deferred under sfas no 
and is recognized to net periodic pension cost over a five year period 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the expected long term rates used by year 
the company assumed a long term rate of return on pension assets of in both fiscal and  and experienced gains on plan assets of million in fiscal and million in fiscal carrying values of long lived assets midas evaluates the carrying values of its long lived assets to be held and used in the business by reviewing undiscounted cash flows by asset group 
such evaluations are performed whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the projected undiscounted cash flows over the remaining lives of the related assets does not exceed the carrying values of the assets  the carrying values are adjusted for the differences between the fair values and the carrying values 
additionally  in the case of fixed assets related to locations that will be closed or sold  the company writes down fixed assets to their estimated recovery value 
in fiscal  the company recorded a million charge to reflect the impairment of certain long lived assets related to the manufacturing and distribution of exhaust 
these assets have been liquidated 
in fiscal  the company determined that impairment existed with respect to long lived assets used in company operated shops 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge to operating expense of million and reduced long lived assets 
deferred income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at december  in the event that management determines the company would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of december   the company had recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain state income tax net operating loss carryovers because the company has determined that it is more likely than not that this portion of these deferred tax assets will not be realized
