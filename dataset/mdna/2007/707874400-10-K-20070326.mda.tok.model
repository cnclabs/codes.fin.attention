item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies amounts in thousands the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures 
such estimates and assumptions significantly affect various reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
management discusses the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee 
management has made estimates in the past that we believed to be appropriate but which were subsequently revised to reflect actual experience 
if our future experience differs materially from these estimates and assumptions  our financial condition and results of operations could be affected 
management considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimated amounts that could have been selected could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
policy reserves and deferred acquisition costs our policies are accounted for as long duration policies 
as a result there are two components of the liabilities associated with our policies 
the first is a liability for future policyholder benefits  represented by the present value of future benefits less the present value of future premium collections 
in calculating these reserves we utilize assumptions  including estimates for persistency policies that do not terminate  morbidity claims expectations  interest rates  expenses and premium rate increases 
these assumptions are estimated in the year a policy is issued 
once the assumptions are established  we continue to utilize those assumptions unless our assessment of deferred acquisition costs dac indicates that the current unamortized dac asset is not recoverable in future periods 
any variance from the assumptions established in the year a policy is issued could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the significant assumptions utilized in setting our reserves for future policyholder benefits are the use of a voluntary lapse rate that ranges from to  depending on the age of the policyholder  the number of years the policy has been in force and other characteristics 
the high end of the lapse rate range is  which is utilized for our more recently issued policies in their first year of issue at policyholder ages of and above 
a significant majority of our policyholders are between the ages of to at the time we issue them a policy 
the lapse rates for these ages range from a high of in the first year a policy is issued down to in the later durations 
morbidity based upon past company experience and industry data 
we also include an estimate for improving morbidity trends in the general population 
the use of the select and ultimate  sex distinct  actuarial table for mortality 
for policies issued in through  we use a interest rate to discount future experience 
for policies issued prior to  we use a interest rate to discount future experience 
we also include an estimate of premium rate increases for certain policies issued prior to  based on the premium rate increases we estimated as of september  this is the last time we revised our assumptions and recorded an impairment to our dac 
we have achieved of these premium rate increases as of june  consideration of the terms and expected recapture timing of the centre agreement 
our assumptions remain unchanged in future periods regardless of actual experience unless we impair our dac due to an expected loss in future periods using updated assumptions for all of the above 
however  when actual experience differs from our expectations  the incremental difference between actual and expected results is recognized in the current period 
in connection with the sale of our insurance policies  we defer and amortize a portion of the policy acquisition costs over the related premium paying periods of the life of the policy 
these costs include all expenses that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of the policy  including commissions  underwriting and other policy issue expenses 
we defer of new premiums for the general and administrative expenses related to issuing a policy 
the premium paying periods of the life of the policy are the same assumptions utilized for persistency in the future benefit reserves 
we assess the recoverability of our unamortized dac asset on a quarterly basis  through actuarial analysis 
to determine recoverability  the present value of anticipated future premiums less future costs and claims are added to current reserve balances 
if this amount is greater than the current unamortized dac  then the dac is deemed recoverable 
if this amount is less than the current unamortized dac  then we impair our dac and record a charge in our current period results of operations 
the dac recoverability analysis includes our most recent assumptions for persistency  morbidity  interest rates  expenses and premium rate increases  all or any of which may be different than the assumptions utilized in establishing our benefit reserves 
the significant assumptions utilized in the dac recoverability analysis that differs from our current assumptions for policy reserves and dac include an investment income rate of initially  grading to the for newly investable funds by an estimate that claims expense will improve beyond the assumptions we utilized in our locked in estimates due to the expected results from recently implemented and future planned improvements to our claims adjudication procedures 
recognition of actual premium rate increases achieved as well as an estimate related to premium rate increases that we began filing in november of our assumption is that most of these premium rate increases will be implemented beginning in the second half of through the end of  although we also assume that some of the premium rate increases will be implemented in and there is also an assumption related to an increased number of people lapsing due to the premium rate increases and therefore an assumption related to anti selection as a result of the premium rate increases 
anti selection is the lapsation of policies held by healthier policyholders  leading to a higher expected ratio of claims to premiums in future periods 
mortality assumptions based on a study completed in september which measured our actual mortality experience  considering underwriting class as well as age and gender 
voluntary lapse rates based on a new study completed in november of  which indicate that policies are lapsing at a slower rate than we previously assumed consideration of the terms and expected recapture timing of the imagine agreement 
the premium rate increases we are filing vary by the policy type  benefit period  underwriting class and the age of the policyholder 
the aggregate average increase is approximately  although the policy forms for which we have filed premium rate increase requests have an average increase ranging from to 
the timing of state approvals for premium rate increases varies 
some states will approve the amount we filed within to months of the receipt of the filing while other states will take up to a year and may only approve a portion of the amount we filed 
in those situations  we will file for additional premium rate increases as soon as practicable in order to obtain the remaining portion of the premium rate increase  so long as it is still actuarially justified 
therefore  to implement of the premium rate increases may take as long as or years 
we have received approval from one state for one of our policy forms in that state as of the date of the filing of the form k 
long term care insurance has fixed annual premiums that can be adjusted only upon approval of the insurance departments of the states where the premiums were written 
the process for filing for premium rate increases requires us to demonstrate to the insurance department that expected claims experience is anticipated to exceed original assumptions 
the approval of premium rate increases is at the discretion of the insurance department 
we have filed and implemented premium rate increases on most of our in force policies 
we have and are continuing to file and implement additional premium rate increases on the majority of our policies issued prior to we have been successful in obtaining premium rate increases in the past 
however  there has been increased public and regulatory scrutiny and litigation over the practice of obtaining premium rate increases on long term care insurance 
we base our premium rate increase assumptions on our past experience and our expectations of the amounts of actual rate increases that we will be able to achieve 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining the assumed level of premium rate increases  we could recognize an impairment in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
changes in one or a combination of these assumptions can produce significant volatility in the recoverability of dac 
claim reserves the second component of the liabilities associated with our policies is a reserve we establish for incurred  either reported or not yet reported  claims 
this amount represents the benefits to be paid in the future for our current claims 
the significant assumptions utilized in establishing claim reserves are expectations about the duration  cost of care being reimbursed  the interest rate utilized to discount the claim reserves  claims that have been incurred but not yet reported  claims that have been closed but are expected to reopen and assumptions about which claims that are currently in their eligibility review stage will eventually become claims that have payments associated with them 
we establish our claim reserves in each period based upon our most currently available information and assumptions 
a significant majority of our claims do not go beyond three years in duration 
due to the relatively large amount of data we have on claims in these early durations  the assumption about the length of claims in these durations is primarily based on our own past experience 
the expected duration of claims is derived through continuance studies 
continuance studies determine our assumption about the probability of a claim continuing once it has reached a certain point 
the continuance studies are done by segments of similar claims which include categories such as policy type nursing home  home health care  or comprehensive  medical condition causing the claims which is categorized as short term  intermediate  long term or cognitive impairment  the age of the claimant at time of claim and gender 
there is no guarantee that past performance is an indicator of future performance 
if our assumptions about continuance are incorrect and individuals stay on claim longer than expected  it could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations both our experience and the industry s experience with claims that last longer than three years is much more limited due to the relatively small number of claims that go past the third year 
a majority of our policies were written in the late s through and therefore there are only a limited number of claims on which to base any conclusions 
therefore  we rely on a combination of our experience and studies performed by the society of actuaries or other sources for claims in the later durations 
due to the limited amount of data  there is a higher likelihood of variance related to this assumption and any variance could have a material affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  we changed our assumption related to claims that lasted longer than three years  resulting in a revised assumption that once a claim lasted longer than three years  it would last longer than we previously assumed 
as a result of this change in assumptions  we increased claim reserves approximately  in the fourth quarter of as part of continuance assumptions  we also try to reflect anticipated changes in mortality of disabled lives and recovery rates of people on claim 
reviewing past experience is a partial guide  but changes in the future may not follow past patterns 
the cost of care being utilized is also based on our historical experience 
in general  a significant portion of our older polices reimburse claimants that are receiving care in a facility on an indemnity basis  meaning that we pay of the maximum daily benefit regardless of the cost of the care provided 
our newer generations of products pay facility claims on a cost incurred basis  meaning that we only reimburse for the cost of care provided up to the maximum daily benefit 
however  all of our home health care benefits are paid on a cost incurred basis regardless of when the policy was issued 
if our assumptions related to the percentage of the maximum daily benefit that we will pay on claims are higher than anticipated  it could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
because our claim payments are made over a period of time  we utilize a discount rate of for claim reserves in order to determine the present value of future expected payments 
this discount rate approximates the current yield to maturity of our assets supporting this future liability 
we make an assumption that there have been a number of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported 
this assumption is based on historical studies related to the number of claims that are reported after the date of the financial statements that have been incurred prior to the date of financial statements 
this assumption also reflects recent patterns relating to incidence rates 
there are also assumptions related to claims that are closed but are expected to reopen 
these are typically claims where we have requested information that has not been received and therefore close the claim and receive the requested information subsequent to closing the claim 
the assumption related to these claims is also based on our historical experience 
the other significant assumption we make is for the likelihood of a reported claim that has not yet had a payment  because it is in its initial eligibility assessment  becoming a claim with payments in the future 
this assumption is also based on our past experience 
we also make an assumption related to improvements in our claims adjudication processes that we believe will result in lower benefits expense than our historical experience would indicate 
these improvements  some of which have been fully implemented and some of which are in the process of being implemented  include  but are not limited to the use of our in house nursing staff to establish and manage plans of care for a larger number of claims than in the past  expanded claim audit process 
increased fraud investigation 
enhancements to our systems to reduce manual procedures 
as part of our monitoring of claims reserves  we compare actual results to our expectations 
any deviation from our expectations is recorded in the period in which the deviation occurs 
any changes in our estimates in the future may have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
litigation and contingencies we are involved in legal proceedings relating to our operations 
we recognize an estimated loss for contingencies when we believe it is probable that a loss has occurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
however  it is difficult to measure the actual loss that might be incurred related to litigation and contingency matters 
as time passes and additional facts and circumstances become known  our estimation of the probability of loss as well as our ability to reasonably estimate a loss may change 
the ultimate outcome of litigation and other contingencies could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
imagine reinsurance agreements the imagine reinsurance agreements the imagine agreement and the imagine agreement are being accounted for using deposit accounting for reinsurance contracts 
we are using deposit accounting because we believe the reinsurance contracts do not result in the reasonable possibility that the reinsurer will suffer a significant loss 
we assessed these long duration reinsurance contracts using the reasonable possibility of significant loss criteria due to certain contract provisions that limit the risk to the reinsurer  including an aggregate limit of liability for the reinsurer  experience refund provisions and expense and risk charges provided to the reinsurer 
we also entered into the reinsurance agreements with the intent of commuting the agreements in the future 
however  the agreement meets the requirements to qualify for reinsurance treatment under statutory accounting rules  which requires a reinsurance agreement to transfer risk to the reinsurer  but does not require the reasonable probability of a significant loss required under gaap 
as noted above  the imagine agreement contains commutation provisions and allows the company to recapture the reinsured policies as of january   or on january of any year thereafter 
if the agreement is commuted on january   the company will be obligated to pay an early termination fee equal to two quarters of expense and risk charges 
the company intends  but is not required  to commute the agreement on january  in the event the company does not commute the imagine agreement on or before january   the expense and risk charge paid to the reinsurer will increase by percent 
in the event the company does not commute the agreement on or before january   but does commute at a later date  the experience refund will not exceed the statutory reserves as of the date of commutation  resulting in the company s forfeiture of any accumulated statutory profits 
in order to commute the agreement and remain in compliance with requisite regulatory minimum standards  we will need to have a risk based capital ratio of at least 
while our current modeling and actuarial projections suggest that our rbc ratio will be at or slightly above and therefore we will be able to commute the imagine agreement on january   we also believe that we should have an additional margin for any adverse development in order to recapture the block of business 
we believe that alternatives such as modifications to the current reinsurance agreement  new reinsurance agreements  or additional capital issuances are available to obtain the necessary margin  if needed 
these projections include assumptions related to premiums new sales  persistency  and the timing of premium rate increases  investment income  expense levels  incurred claims paid claims plus change in claim reserves and changes in our future policyholder benefits 
if there is any negative variance in our assumptions related to these projections  we may not be able to commute the imagine agreement on january   as planned  which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in the event the company determines that commutation of the imagine agreement is unlikely on or before january   but likely at some future date  it will include additional annual expense and risk charges in its unamortized deferred acquisition cost dac recoverability analysis 
as a result  it could impair the value of its dac asset and record the impairment in its financial statements at that time 
however  the company currently believes that ptna and anic will have sufficient statutory capital and surplus to commute the agreement on january  our agreement requires us to file premium rate increases within days of our determination of need for these increases 
failure to file such rate increases within the prescribed time is defined in the agreement as a material breach event  which  if uncorrected would ultimately lead to a reduction in the reinsurer s liability to reimburse claims made in the future under the agreement 
although we filed our premium rate increases more than days after our determination of need in  thereby creating a material breach event  the reinsurer considers our ultimate filings to be sufficient to cover our obligations under the agreement and has not reduced the aggregate limit of liability 
goodwill our goodwill relates to the purchase of our insurance agencies  united insurance group agency  inc uig and network insurance senior health division nishd 
we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis unless an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that an impairment has occurred 
during we performed our impairment test on a quarterly basis due to declining sales 
the test is done at the reporting unit level  which combines the operations of uig and nishd 
uig and nishd are both insurance agencies that sell senior market insurance products  and therefore have similar economic characteristics 
during our quarterly impairment test as of december   we determined that the goodwill was impaired 
this impairment was a result of declining sales  particularly in the fourth quarter of  which led to lower than planned net income at the reporting unit level 
the decline in sales is attributable to a decline in sales across the long term care industry during as a result of higher priced policies and the negative impact of premium rate increases that have been implemented on previously issued policies 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined utilizing the present value of cash flows  which includes assumptions for future growth in sales 
during the impairment test  we lowered the assumptions related to future sales growth and as a result recognized an impairment of  in there was no impairment in the significant assumptions in our impairment test include future growth in sales of insurance policies  the persistency of the renewal commission stream and estimated future expenses 
the projection encompasses a year period  and we utilized a discount rate 
we assume that our agencies are capable of future growth from both the sale of our products and from the sale of other carriers products 
our future growth assumptions ranged from in the first years and stabilized at in the later years of our analysis 
the growth rates in the early years are dependent upon the ability of our agencies to execute on recently signed agreements with unaffiliated insurance companies and to sell policies underwritten by our insurance subsidiaries 
the renewal commission stream is based on the contracts that the agencies have with various insurance carriers and historical patterns of persistency 
valuation allowance for income taxes we have net operating loss carryforwards of  or  on a tax affected basis  which have been generated by taxable losses at the parent company  and if unused will expire between and we have net operating loss carryforwards of  or  on a tax effected basis  which have been generated by taxable losses at our insurance subsidiaries  and if unused  will expire in the parent company s net operating loss carryforwards can be utilized by our insurance subsidiaries  subject to a limitation equal to the lesser of of the insurance subsidiary taxable income or of the current aggregate carryforward amount 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of  against our net operating loss carryforwards on a tax affected basis 
we recorded the valuation allowance due to a change in ownership as defined in the internal revenue code 
as a result of the change in ownership  we are now subject to a limitation on the amount of prior period net operating loss carryforwards we can utilize 
if we do not generate enough taxable income in the future we may need to record an additional valuation allowance  which could have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
overview our principal products are individual  defined benefit accident and health insurance policies that consist of nursing home care and home health care 
our insurance subsidiaries are subject to the insurance laws and regulations of the states in which they are licensed to write insurance 
these laws and regulations govern matters such as payment of dividends  settlement of claims and loss ratios 
state regulatory authorities must approve premiums charged for insurance products 
in addition  our insurance subsidiaries are required to establish and maintain reserves with respect to reported and incurred but not reported claims  as well as estimated future benefits payable under our insurance policies 
these reserves must  at a minimum  comply with mandated standards 
our reserves are certified annually by our consulting actuary as to standards required by the insurance departments for our domiciliary states and for the other states in which we conduct business 
we believe we maintained adequate reserves as mandated by each state in which we are currently writing business at december  and results of operations twelve months ended december  and amounts in thousands premium revenue 
total premium revenue earned in the twelve months ended december   decreased to  compared to  in the same period in total first year premium revenue earned in increased to  compared to  in first year long term care premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in we believe that the increase in first year premiums is due to the recommencement of sales in additional states  the engagement of additional independent agents that had not previously sold our policies  and the introduction of our new products  which have higher annual premiums than our previously sold products 
while many of our new products are sold at higher premium levels than previous products with similar benefits  a portion of the higher premium is attributable to an additional margin for future adverse claims deviation  as required by many states 
while these products yield increased profits due to the additional margin  future premium rate increases  if needed  may be more difficult to achieve due to the revised state insurance department rules regarding these increases 
total renewal premium revenue earned in decreased to  compared to  in renewal long term care premiums earned in decreased to  compared to  in the decrease in renewal premium revenue is due to the lapsation of existing policies 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience reduced levels of renewal premium revenue until such time as the combination of an increased level of new premiums and the implementation of premium rate increases on policies issued prior to is sufficient to offset the lapsation of existing policies 
our persistency was and for the and periods  respectively 
net investment income 
net investment income earned in increased to  from  in our average yield on invested assets at cost  including cash and cash equivalents  was and in and  respectively 
our net investment income included an investment income component from our centre agreement notional experience account prior to may  and for all of the investment income component of our notional experience account investment credit generated  and  in and  respectively 
the notional experience account yielded a fixed return based upon the yield to maturity of the underlying benchmark indices  which were comprised of us treasury strips  government agencies and investment grade corporate bonds with weightings of approximately  and  respectively  and had a duration of approximately years 
the average yield on the notional experience account was and in and  respectively 
we commuted the centre agreement in may of and received investments of approximately million as a result of the commutation 
we have gradually reduced the duration of this portfolio to approximately years at december  by selling long duration us treasury strips and purchasing medium duration mortgage backed securities 
net realized capital losses gains 
we recorded capital losses of  in compared to capital gains of in we reduced our cost basis on bonds in by due to differences deemed other than temporary 
we reduced our cost basis for these bonds because the fair value for these bonds was below amortized cost for a period of greater than months 
the remaining capital losses in were due to sales of securities that were part of our strategy of shortening the duration of our portfolio and increasing the yield on our portfolio 
market gain on notional experience account 
we recorded a gain on our notional experience account of  and  in and  respectively 
following the commutation of our centre agreement in may  we no longer record gains or losses attributable to a notional experience account 
during the period of january through may the interest rates on the underlying investments in the benchmark indices supporting our notional experience account declined resulting in a market gain 
during the interest rates on the underlying investments in the benchmark indices supporting our notional experience account were lower at the end of the year compared to the beginning of the year  resulting in a market gain 
the total return of the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index was and in and  respectively 
the total return on our notional experience account  which generated the majority of our net investment income through may and throughout  was and for the five months of and all of  respectively 
we attribute the favorable return achieved from the notional experience account in and to the impact of declining market interest rates upon the long duration of the underlying benchmark indices 
following the commutation of our centre agreement in may  we invested our assets in instruments similar to the benchmark indices underlying our notional experience account 
from july through december  this portfolio had a total loss of 
we believe that this loss in total return is consistent with the observed increase in market interest rates for the period  the duration of the portfolio  and the yields imbedded in the portfolio compared to comparable investment vehicles available for purchase in the market during that time 
change in preferred interest on early conversion 
we recorded a gain of  on the change in preferred interest on early conversion or our convertible debt in as compared to a gain of  in the fair value of the embedded derivative decreased to zero in october  the date the offer ended for the additional shares of our common stock 
as a result  a gain of  was recorded for the gain in was a result of  of conversions and the decrease in the value of the interest we would pay upon the conversion due to the shortening of the time period between the date of conversion and october all of our outstanding convertible debt was converted to our common stock in november other income 
we recorded  in other income in  as compared to  in the increase is attributable to a number of items  including the recognition of a deferred gain from the sale of our disability business 
the sale was done as a quota share agreement  in contemplation of a subsequent assumption of the business  where actual ownership of the policies would change 
for  the process to complete the remaining policyholder assumptions was completed and we recorded  as other income 
we recorded a gain of as a result of the commutation of the centre agreement 
the commission income related to our agency subsidiaries increased to  in compared to  in the increase in commission income was related to the sale of medicare private fee for service and part d medicare products by our agency subsidiaries 
benefits to policyholders 
total benefits to policyholders in increased to  compared to  in our loss ratio  or policyholder benefits to premiums  was in  compared to in in our long term care claim reserves increased approximately  compared to a decrease of approximately million in the increase in was primarily a result of an adjustment to our assumption related to the length of time a claim will stay open after it has been open for more than three years along with a change in the discount rate used to set our claim reserves from to  based on the yield of our portfolio at december  the decrease in is attributable to refinements to the model we utilized to calculate claim reserves  including the addition of diagnosis code data  payment frequency data  and further delineation of policy forms for purposes of evaluation of existing continuance tables 
as a result claims reserves were reduced by approximately  an increase in the discount rate used for claim reserves from to  reflecting our improved investment portfolio performance  which reduced reserves by approximately  during  fewer claims that were closed as of december  reopened than we had estimated  resulting in a reduction of approximately  and claim reserve adjudication process improvements implemented in the second half of and throughout the remaining variance between and is attributable to the change in our future policyholder benefits 
this is due to variances between our original assumptions for lapses  morbidity and mortality compared to our actual experience 
in addition  although we achieved of our projected aggregate premium rate increases as of december  from our locked in assumptions  premium rate increases on individual forms were either above or below the average  which resulted in additional increases to our reserve for future policyholder benefits 
we achieved of the assumed premium rate increases by june and therefore do not anticipate any additional variances caused by this assumption 
we establish reserves for current claims based upon current and historical experience of our policyholder benefits  including an expectation of claims incidence and duration  as well as the establishment of a reserve for claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported ibnr 
we continuously monitor our experience to determine the best estimate of reserves to be held for future payments of these claims 
as a result  we periodically refine our process to incorporate the most recent known information in establishing these reserves 
claims experience can differ from our expectations due to numerous factors  including mortality rates  duration of care and type of care utilized 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating historical claims experience and statistical information with respect to the probable number and nature of such claims 
we compare actual experience with estimates and adjust reserves on the basis of such comparisons 
we evaluate our prior year assumptions by reviewing the development of reserves for the prior period 
during  reserve amounts relating to december  and prior had an unfavorable development of  these changes to prior year reserve amounts particularly when calculated as a percentage of the prior year end reserve balance provide a relative measure of deviation in actual performance as compared to our initial assumptions 
the adjustments to reserves for claims incurred in prior periods are primarily attributable to claims incurred from our long term care insurance policies  which represent approximately of our premium in force 
the unfavorable development in is attributable to the change in our assumption related to the mortality of policyholders that are on claim in excess of three years 
commissions 
commissions to agents decreased to  in  compared to  in first year commissions on accident and health business in increased to  compared to  in  primarily due to the increase in first year accident and health premiums 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in and in this increase was due to the first year commission paid to one fmo that is paid a higher first year commission and lower renewal commissions than our traditional structure 
we collected  of premium for this fmo and paid first year commissions of  this arrangement was not material in the ratio of first year accident and health commission to first year accident and health premiums would have been in without this arrangement 
renewal commissions on accident and health business in decreased to  compared to  in primarily due to the decrease in renewal accident and health premiums 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in and in we have implemented premium rate increases on a majority of policies written prior to december  we do not pay commissions on the additional premium collected as a result of a premium rate increase  which reduces the ratio of renewal commissions to renewal premium revenue 
we anticipate that this ratio will continue to decline until all premium rate increases are fully implemented 
net policy acquisition costs amortized 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs amortized in decreased to  compared to  in deferred costs are typically all costs that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of new premiums 
these costs include the variable portion of commissions  which are defined as the first year commissions less ultimate renewal commissions  and variable general and administrative expenses related to policy sales  underwriting and issuance 
deferred costs are amortized over the life of the policy based upon actuarial assumptions  including persistency of policies in force 
in the event that a policy lapses prematurely due to death or termination of coverage  the remaining unamortized portion of the deferred amount is immediately recognized as expense in the current period 
the net amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is affected by new business generation  imputed interest on prior reserves and policy persistency 
the amortization of deferred costs is generally offset largely by the deferral of costs associated with new premium generation 
however  the level of new premium sales during the and periods produced less expense deferral than needed to offset amortized costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in increased to  compared to  in the ratio of total general and administrative expenses to premium revenues was in  compared to in the increase in was primarily related to additional costs related to accounting  actuarial and consulting fees 
these fees increased due to work related to our increase in claim reserves in the fourth quarter of  our written submission to the sec related to prospective unlocking and the delay in filing our form k 
in addition the general and administrative expenses at our agency subsidiaries increased in  corresponding with their increase in other income 
litigation accrual expense 
during  we accrued for the final resolution of the two lawsuits related to the sale of long term care policies 
in addition we accrued related to the final resolution of two additional lawsuits in during  we accrued  related to the anticipated resolution of two lawsuits related the sale of long term care policies 
in addition  we accrued  in related to the settlement of a separate lawsuit 
see item legal proceedings for details 
loss due to impairment of property  plant and equipment 
subsequent to december   we determined that the new administrative system that we were in the process of installing would not yield the benefits and efficiencies to operations that were originally intended 
as a result of this determination we have decided not to continue to pursue this project and have impaired its capitalized value through a charge to income of  there are additional amounts of approximately that were capitalized in that will also be impaired through a charge to income 
commutation expense 
the centre agreement was commuted effective may  we recorded a termination fee of  in related to the early commutation of this agreement 
reinsurance warrants expense 
as part of the centre agreement  the reinsurer was granted four tranches of warrants to purchase shares of non voting convertible preferred stock 
the warrants were forfeited as part of the early commutation of the agreement 
the remaining value of  was recorded as an expense in expense and risk charges on reinsurance 
in and  we incurred expense and risk charges of  and  respectively 
our imagine agreements provide the reinsurer an expense and risk charge equal to the sum of of total ceded statutory reserves at the end of a quarter and of the value of the combination of any letters of credit or funds deposited in trust by the reinsurer as of the beginning of the quarter 
our centre agreement provided the reinsurer with expense and risk charges 
the annual charge consisted of a fixed cost and a variable component based upon reserve and capital levels needed to support the reinsured business 
excise tax expense 
we were subject to an excise tax for premium payments made to a foreign reinsurer under the centre agreement equal to one percent of the net premium revenue ceded to the foreign reinsurer 
we recorded and  for excise tax expenses in and  respectively 
the amount decreased in due to the commutation of the centre agreement effective may  there are no excise taxes related to the imagine agreements 
interest expense 
interest expense in decreased to  compared to  in the interest expense in and is primarily related to our convertible subordinated notes  which bore interest at an annual rate of 
we incurred additional interest expense related to the conversion of our convertible subordinated notes prior to october  holders of our convertible subordinated notes were entitled to convert their notes into shares of our common stock before october  and receive a discounted amount of interest that they would have otherwise received through october  had they not converted the notes 
we incurred of interest expense from the conversion of  in convertible subordinated notes during we incurred  of interest expense from the conversion of  in convertible subordinated notes during in addition  interest expense decreased due to a reduction in outstanding notes as a result of the conversions 
the notes automatically converted to shares of the company s common stock on november  the conversion occurred under the terms of the notes because the average closing price of the company s common stock on the fifteen trading days following october  was greater than of the conversion price of 
there was  of notes outstanding on november  immediately after the conversion on november   there were  shares of common stock issued and outstanding 
benefit provision for federal income taxes 
in  we recorded a benefit for federal income taxes of  compared to a provision for federal income taxes of  in the effective tax rate was in compared to in in  the effective tax rate utilized to record our benefit for federal income taxes was higher than our statutory tax rate of primarily due to the release of  of contingency reserves related to tax positions taken in the past for which the tax years are no longer open to audit 
in  the effective tax rate utilized to record our provision for federal income taxes was higher than our statutory tax rate of primarily due to the impairment charge recorded against the goodwill of uig  which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
twelve months ended december  and amounts in thousands premium revenue 
total premium revenue earned in the twelve months ended december   decreased to  compared to  in the same period in total first year premium revenue earned in increased to  compared to  in first year long term care premiums earned in increased to  compared to  in we believe that the increase in first year premiums is due to the recommencement of sales in additional states  the engagement of additional independent agents that had not previously sold our policies  and the introduction of our new products  which have higher annual premiums than our previously sold products 
total renewal premium revenue earned in decreased to  compared to  in renewal long term care premiums earned in decreased to  compared to  in the decrease in renewal premium revenue is due to the lapsation of existing policies 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience reduced levels of renewal premium revenue until such time as the combination of an increased level of new premiums and the implementation of premium rate increases on policies issued prior to is sufficient to offset the lapsation of existing policies 
our persistency was and for the and periods  respectively 
net investment income 
net investment income earned in increased to  from  in our average yield on invested assets at cost  including cash and cash equivalents  was and  respectively  in and the investment income component of our notional experience account investment credit generated  and  in and  respectively 
the notional experience account yields a fixed return based upon the yield to maturity of the underlying benchmark indices  which are comprised of us treasury strips  government agencies and investment grade corporate bonds with weightings of approximately  and  respectively 
the notional experience account has a duration of approximately years and the average yield on the notional experience account was and for and  respectively 
market gain loss on notional experience account 
we recorded a market gain on our notional experience account of  in compared to a market loss of  in during the interest rates on the underlying investments in the benchmark indices supporting our notional experience account were lower at the end of the year compared to the beginning of the year  resulting in a market gain 
during  although interest rates were volatile during the year  interest rates at the beginning and end of the year were relatively unchanged 
the total return of the lehman brothers us aggregate bond index was and for and  respectively 
the total return on our notional experience account  which generates the majority of our net investment income  was and in and  respectively 
management attributes the favorable return achieved from its notional experience account in to the impact of declining market interest rates upon the long duration of the underlying benchmark indices 
in  market interest rates remained stable  producing an immaterial impact upon the total market return of the notional experience account 
change in preferred interest on early conversion 
the fair value of the embedded derivative as of the date that the option to receive discounted interest was granted was  due to the issuance of additional convertible debt in february and november of  we recorded an additional  representing the fair values of these embedded derivatives 
as of december   we adjusted the embedded derivative to its then fair value of  by recording a gain of  compared to a loss of in the value decreased in as a result of  of conversions and the decrease in the value of the interest we would pay upon the conversion due to the shortening of the time period between the date of conversion and october during  the liquidity of our common stock rose significantly  as did the average daily trading volume  which indicated that the market could absorb additional shares without significant reduction of the market price 
as a result  we increased our estimates of the value of the embedded derivative based on an assumption that conversions were more likely to occur without stock price deflation 
other income 
we recorded  in other income during  as compared to  in the income generated from our ownership of corporate owned life insurance policies coli decreased to in  compared to  in the cash value of these policies is invested in investment grade corporate bonds and equity indexes 
we receive a crediting rate  net of insurance costs and fees  for maintaining a stable value of the assets  which was reduced significantly during due to deterioration in the underlying bond and equity investments of the funds supporting the coli 
in addition  the average balance decreased from approximately  in to approximately  in due to death benefit payments 
the average yield on the income generated from the corporate owned life insurance was in  compared to in the commission income related to our agency subsidiaries decreased to  in compared to  in this decrease was a result of lower sales in  primarily related to the sale of long term care insurance 
the long term care industry experienced a decrease in new policy sales in compared to benefits to policyholders 
total benefits to policyholders in decreased to  compared to  in our loss ratio  or policyholder benefits to premiums  was in  compared to in we believe the improvement in the loss ratio is primarily due to the impact of premium rate increases  changes in certain assumptions used in the calculation of our claim reserves and improved claims adjudication procedures implemented during and we establish reserves for current claims based upon current and historical experience of our policyholder benefits  including an expectation of claims incidence and duration  as well as the establishment of a reserve for claims that have been incurred but are not yet reported ibnr 
we continuously monitor our experience to determine the best estimate of reserves to be held for future payments of these claims 
as a result  we periodically refine our process to incorporate the most recent known information in establishing these reserves 
claims experience can differ from our expectations due to numerous factors  including mortality rates  duration of care and type of care utilized 
the amount of reserves relating to reported and unreported claims incurred is determined by periodically evaluating historical claims experience and statistical information with respect to the probable number and nature of such claims 
we compare actual experience with estimates and adjust reserves on the basis of such comparisons 
we evaluate our prior year assumptions by reviewing the development of reserves for the prior period 
during  reserves amounts relating to december  and prior had a favorable development of  compared to a favorable development of  during for reserve amounts relating to december  and prior 
these changes to prior year reserve amounts particularly when calculated as a percentage of the prior year end reserve balance provide a relative measure of deviation in actual performance as compared to our initial assumptions 
the adjustments to reserves for claims incurred in prior periods are primarily attributable to claims incurred from our long term care insurance policies  which represent approximately of our premiums in force 
the favorable development in is attributable to refinements to the model we utilized to calculate claim reserves  including the addition of diagnosis code data  payment frequency data  and further delineation of policy forms for purposes of evaluation of existing continuance tables 
as a result claim reserves were reduced by approximately  an increase in the discount rate used for claim reserves from to  reflecting our improved investment portfolio performance  which reduced reserves by approximately  during  fewer claims that were closed as of december  reopened than we had estimated  resulting in a reduction of approximately  and claim reserve adjudication process improvements implemented in the second half of and throughout the development of our prior year assumptions were in line with our expectations for commissions 
commissions to agents decreased to  in  compared to  in first year commissions on accident and health business in increased to  compared to  in  primarily due to the increase in first year accident and health premiums 
the ratio of first year accident and health commissions to first year accident and health premiums was in and in long term care policies  other than our secured risk policy  pay a first year commission based on the age of the policyholder  ranging from at ages to at ages and higher 
in both and the secured risk policy paid a flat first year commission of regardless of the age of the policyholder 
the increase in the ratio of first year accident and health commissions in compared to is primarily due to a decrease in the average age of new policyholders from approximately in to approximately in this is partially offset by an increase in the percentage of secured risk policies issued in each respective year  from approximately in to in renewal commissions on accident and health business in decreased to  compared to  in due to the decrease in renewal accident and health premiums and a reduction in the percentage of renewal premiums paid in the form of renewal commissions 
the ratio of renewal accident and health commissions to renewal accident and health premiums was in and in we have implemented premium rate increases on a majority of policies written prior to december  we do not pay commissions on the additional premium collected as a result of a premium rate increase  which reduces the ratio of renewal commissions to renewal premium revenue 
we anticipate that this ratio will continue to decline until all premium rate increases are fully implemented 
net policy acquisition costs amortized 
the net deferred policy acquisition costs amortized in increased to  compared to  in deferred costs are typically all costs that are directly related to  and vary with  the acquisition of new premiums 
these costs include the variable portion of commissions  which are defined as the first year commissions less ultimate renewal commissions  and variable general and administrative expenses related to policy sales  underwriting and issuance 
deferred costs are amortized over the life of the policy based upon actuarial assumptions  including persistency of policies in force 
in the event that a policy lapses prematurely due to death or termination of coverage  the remaining unamortized portion of the deferred amount is immediately recognized as expense in the current period 
the net amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs is affected by new business generation  imputed interest on prior reserves and policy persistency 
the amortization of deferred costs is generally offset largely by the deferral of costs associated with new premium generation 
however  the level of new premium sales during the and periods produced less expense deferral than needed to offset amortized costs 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in decreased to  compared to  in the ratio of total general and administrative expenses to premium revenues was in  compared to in in we recorded expenses of  related to the initial recognition of future retirement benefits payable to our former chairman and severance related expenses for certain managers and employees whose positions were eliminated 
we did not have a similar charge in expenses at one of our agency subsidiaries were approximately  less in than in due to reductions in staff and the closing of certain unprofitable agency offices 
legal fees were approximately less in than due to a reduction in activity related to our litigation 
outside actuarial fees were approximately  less in than in as the combination of less premium rate increase filings and increased internal staffing levels served to reduce reliance on outside parties 
also in there was a reduction in expenses related to the implementation of internally developed software of approximately while we were in the process of choosing a new vendor 
these reductions were partially offset by increases in variable costs related to increased sales levels 
impairment of goodwill 
the goodwill at both december  and relates to the purchase of our insurance agencies  uig and nishd 
we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis unless an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not indicate that an impairment has occurred 
we tested for impairment on a quarterly basis during due to declining sales 
the test is done at a reporting unit level  which combines the operations of uig and nishd 
uig and nishd are both insurance agencies that sell senior market insurance products  and therefore have similar economic characteristics 
during our quarterly impairment test as of december   we determined that the goodwill related to the agency reporting unit was impaired 
this impairment was a result of declining sales  particularly in the fourth quarter of  which led to lower than planned net income at the reporting unit level 
the decline in sales is attributable to a decline in sales across the long term care industry during as a result of higher priced policies and the negative impact of premium rate increases that have been implemented on previously issued policies 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined utilizing the present value of cash flows  which includes assumptions for future growth in sales 
during the most recent impairment test  we lowered the assumptions related to future sales growth and as a result recognized an impairment of  in there was no impairment recognized in litigation accrual expense 
during  we accrued  for the anticipated resolution of two lawsuits related to the sale of long term policies 
in addition  we accrued  related to the settlement of a separate lawsuit 
see item legal proceedings for details 
expense and risk charges on reinsurance and excise tax expense 
our reinsurance agreement provides the reinsurer with annual expense and risk charges  which are credited against our notional experience account in the event of future commutation of the agreement 
the annual charge consists of a fixed cost and a variable component based upon reserve and capital levels needed to support the reinsured business 
in and  we incurred charges of  and  respectively for this item 
in addition  we are subject to an excise tax for premium payments made to a foreign reinsurer equal to one percent of the premium revenue ceded to the foreign reinsurer 
we recorded  and  for excise tax expenses in and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense in increased to  compared to  in during february and november of  we issued  and  respectively of additional convertible subordinated notes 
during  we issued  of additional convertible subordinated notes and paid our entire obligation of  related to convertible subordinated notes that matured in our average outstanding convertible subordinated debt for was  compared to  in the amount of interest expense related to the outstanding principal balance was  and  in and  respectively 
holders of our convertible subordinated notes are entitled to convert their notes into shares of our common stock before october and receive a discounted amount of interest that they would have otherwise received through october had they not converted the notes 
we incurred  and  of interest expense from the early conversion of  and  in convertible subordinated notes during and  respectively 
the  of convertible subordinated notes issued in november of  were issued when the price of our common stock was per share 
because this price exceeded the conversion price of per share  we recorded additional interest expense of in provision benefit for federal income taxes 
in  we recorded a provision for federal income taxes of  compared to a benefit from federal income taxes of  in the effective tax rate was in compared to in in  the effective tax rate utilized to record our provision for federal income taxes was higher than our statutory tax rate of primarily due to the impairment charge recorded against the goodwill of uig  which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes 
in  the effective tax rate utilized to record our benefit from federal income taxes was lower than our statutory rate due to the valuation allowance we recorded 
liquidity and capital resources amounts in thousands our consolidated liquidity requirements have historically been met from the operations of our insurance subsidiaries  from our agency subsidiaries and from funds raised in the capital markets 
our primary sources of cash from normal operations are premiums  investment income and maturities of investments 
we have obtained  and may in the future obtain  cash through public and private offerings of our common stock  the exercise of stock options and warrants and other capital markets activities including the sale or exchange of debt instruments 
our primary uses of cash are policy acquisition costs principally commissions  claim payments to policyholders  investment purchases  deposits to our notional experience account  debt service and general and administrative expenses 
our cash increased  in primarily due to  from operations  the receipt of  from the commutation of the centre agreement and the sale of  of bonds 
the major source of cash from operations was premiums received 
cash decreased in primarily due to the purchase of  in bonds 
our cash increased  in primarily due to  in additional funds generated from the issuance of convertible subordinated debt 
this was supplemented by  from operations and the sale of  of bonds 
the major source of cash from operations was premium received 
cash decreased in primarily due to payments made to our reinsurer of  and the purchase of  in bonds 
we invest in securities and other investments authorized by applicable state laws and regulations and follow an investment policy designed to maximize yield to the extent consistent with liquidity requirements and preservation of assets 
as of december   shareholders equity was decreased by  due to unrealized losses of  in the investment portfolio 
as of december   shareholders equity was increased by due to unrealized gains of in the investment portfolio 
the maturities of our principal contractual cash obligations at december   are as follows amounts in thousands thereafter total on balance sheet pension and post retirement benefits capital lease obligations insurance liabilities off balance sheet operating leases vendor contracts total insurance liabilities consist of future policy benefits and unpaid claims and claim expenses relating to the company s insurance products 
substantially all of the amounts contained in this table with respect to such liabilities consist of estimates by the company s management based on various actuarial and other assumptions relating to morbidity  mortality and persistency 
in accordance with gaap  a substantial portion of such liabilities are carried on a discounted basis on the consolidated balance sheet  however  the amounts contained in the table are presented on an undiscounted basis 
the actual payments relating to these liabilities will differ  both in amount and timing  from indicated in the table 
parent company operations amounts in thousands cash flow needs of the parent company primarily include operating expenses 
the funding is primarily derived from the operating cash flow of our agency subsidiary operations and dividends from the insurance subsidiaries 
however  the dividend capabilities of the insurance subsidiaries are limited and we may need to rely upon the dividend capabilities of our agency subsidiaries to meet current liquidity needs 
we have historically engaged in financing activities  including issuance of debt securities to fund our liquidity and subsidiary capital needs 
we did not engage in financing activities in or in the first and third quarters of  we issued an additional  and  respectively in notes 
we used the proceeds to supplement parent liquidity  for general working capital purposes and to further supplement our subsidiaries statutory surplus 
all notes have been converted to common shares as of december  our cash needs for at the parent company are approximately  which are needed for operating expenses 
we have approximately  of cash and investments at the parent company and approximately  of cash and investments at our agency subsidiaries to fund these expenses 
in addition we believe that we will have available approximately  of additional funds available based on projections of net income at our agency subsidiaries 
we have never paid and do not anticipate paying any dividends from the parent company to our shareholders in the foreseeable future due to restrictions on the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the parent company 
subsidiary operations our insurance subsidiaries are regulated by various state insurance departments 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic has risk based capital rbc requirements for insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks  such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines minimum capital standards that an insurer must maintain 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the enterprise s regulatory total adjusted capital  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within certain levels  each of which may require specific corrective action depending upon the insurer s state of domicile 
the majority of our insurance subsidiaries cash flow results from our existing long term care policies  which have been ceded to the reinsurer under this agreement 
our subsidiaries ability to meet additional liquidity needs and cover fixed expenses in the future is highly dependent upon our ability to issue new policies and to control expense growth 
our future growth and new policy issuance is dependent upon our ability to continue to expand our historical markets  retain and expand our network of agents and effectively market our products and our ability to fund our marketing and expansion while maintaining minimum statutory levels of capital and surplus required to support such growth 
states also restrict the dividends our insurance subsidiaries are permitted to pay 
dividend payments will depend on profits arising from the business of our insurance company subsidiaries  computed according to statutory formulae 
under the insurance laws of pennsylvania  new york and florida  where our insurance subsidiaries are domiciled  insurance companies can pay ordinary dividends only out of earned surplus 
in addition  under pennsylvania law  our pennsylvania insurance subsidiaries including our primary insurance subsidiary must give the department at least days advance notice of any proposed extraordinary dividend and cannot pay such a dividend if the department disapproves the payment during that day period 
for purposes of that provision  an extraordinary dividend is a dividend that  together with all other dividends paid during the preceding twelve months  exceeds the greater of of the insurance company s surplus as shown on the company s last annual statement filed with department or its statutory net income as shown on that annual statement 
statutory earnings are generally lower than earnings reported in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles due to the immediate or accelerated recognition of all costs associated with premium growth and benefit reserves 
additionally  our plan requires the department to approve all dividend requests made by ptna  regardless of normal statutory requirements for allowable dividends 
we believe that the department is unlikely to consider any dividend request in the foreseeable future as a result of ptna s current statutory surplus position 
although not stipulated in the plan  this requirement is likely to continue until such time as ptna meets normal statutory allowances  including reported net income and positive cumulative earned surplus 
under new york law  our new york insurance subsidiary american independent network insurance company of new york must give the new york insurance department days advance notice of any proposed dividend and cannot pay any dividend if the regulator disapproves the payment during that day period 
in addition  our new york insurance company must obtain the prior approval of the new york insurance department before paying any dividend that  together with all other dividends paid during the preceding twelve months  exceeds the lesser of of the insurance company s surplus as of the preceding december or its adjusted net investment income for the year ended the preceding december under florida law  our florida insurance subsidiary southern security life insurance company  the purchase of which remains subject to regulatory approval  must give the florida department of insurance regulation days advance notice of any proposed extraordinary dividend or any other extraordinary distribution to our shareholders and cannot pay such a dividend or distribution if the regulator disapproves the payment during that day period 
for purposes of that provision  an extraordinary dividend or extraordinary distribution is any dividend or distribution that exceeds the greater of i the lesser of of the insurance company s surplus or net gain from operations  not including realized capital gains  ii of surplus  with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus of unrealized capital gains  or iii the lesser of of surplus or net investment income net gain before capital gains plus a year carryforward with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus of unrealized capital gains  but shall not include prorata distributions of any class of our florida insurance subsidiary s own securities 
ptna and anic have not paid any dividends to penn treaty in  or and are unlikely in the foreseeable future to be able to make dividend payments due to insufficient statutory surplus and anticipated earnings 
however  our new york subsidiary is not subject to the plan and in march we received a dividend from our new york subsidiary of  the new york subsidiary has not paid any dividends in  or southern security life insurance company has not paid any dividends to penn treaty in  or new accounting principles in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no 
r sfas r share based payment 
sfas r replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires that the cost of share based payment transactions including those with employees and non employees be recognized in the financial statements 
sfas r applies to all share based payment transactions in which an entity acquires goods or services by issuing or offering to issue its shares  share options  or other equity instruments except for those held by an esop or by incurring liabilities in amounts based even in part on the price of the entity s shares or other equity instruments  or that require or may require settlement by the issuance of an entity s shares or other equity instruments 
we have adopted the provisions of sfas r on january   but have not yet determined the impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june of  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no  accounting for purchases of life insurance determining the amount that could be realized in accordance with fasb technical bulletin no 
eitf 
eitf relates to accounting for corporate owned life insurance coli 
we own a coli policy  which is utilized to fund the future payment of employee benefit expenses 
the eitf reached a consensus that a policyholder should consider any additional amounts included in the contractual terms of the policy in determining the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract 
the eitf also reached a consensus that a policyholder should determine the amount that could be realized under the life insurance contract assuming the surrender of an individual life by individual life policy or certificate by certificate in a group policy 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we have not yet determined if the adoption of eitf will have an impact on our financial statements or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return 
the interpretation requires public companies to recognize the tax benefits of uncertain tax positions only where the position is more likely than not to be sustained assuming examination by tax authorities 
the amount recognized would be the amount that represents the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority 
a liability would be recognized for any benefit claimed  or expected to be claimed  in a tax return in excess of the benefit recorded in the financial statements  along with any interest and penalty if applicable on the excess 
fin will require a tabular reconciliation of the change in the aggregate unrecognized tax benefits claimed  or expected to be claimed  in tax returns and disclosure relating to accrued interest and penalties for unrecognized tax benefits 
discussion will also be required for those uncertain tax positions where it is reasonably possible that the estimate of the tax benefit will change significantly in the next months 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we currently are evaluating the impact of adopting fin in february  fasb issued sfas no 
the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this statement provides an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities  including insurance contracts  at fair value 
sfas no 
can be adopted january  so long as the decision to adopt is made within days of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption 
we would need to make this decision by april  we are in the process of evaluating this decision and do not yet know the impact of adopting sfas no 
in september  the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
the interpretations in this sab express the staff s views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
specifically  the sec staff believes that registrants must quantify the impact on current period financial statements of correcting all misstatements  including both those occurring in the current period and the effect of reversing those that have accumulated from prior periods 
this sab should be applied beginning with the first fiscal year ending after november   with early adoption encouraged 
we have elected to adopt sab no 
early  and it is therefore effective for our financial statements for the year ended december  sab no 
permits companies to initially apply its provision either by restating prior financial statements or recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the methodology for quantifying errors described in sab no 
as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
we have elected to record the effects of applying sab no 
using the cumulative effect transition method 
the following table summarizes the effects of applying the guidance in sab no 
cumulative prior to january  year ended december  adjustment recorded as of january  accounts payable and other liabilities federal income taxes receivable or payable impact on net income retained earnings as of january   we discovered errors related to prior period financial statements for the years that on a cumulative basis total  on a pre tax basis and  net of federal income taxes 
the entire amount relates to return of premium benefits that should have been paid to policyholders in prior years but due to an error in our process of identifying which policyholders should be paid  not all of the policyholders were properly identified 
this process has been corrected for although these individual errors are immaterial to the prior periods  the cumulative amount is material to the financial statements because of the adoption of sab no 
mentioned above 
forward looking statements certain statements made by us in this report may be considered forward looking within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of although we believe that our expectations are based upon reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations  there can be no assurance that actual results of our operations will not differ materially from our expectations 
an investment in our securities includes certain risks  which may be specific to us or to the long term care insurance industry 
factors which could cause actual results to differ from expectations include  among others  our ability to comply with the corrective action plan  the florida consent order  the orders or directives of other states in which we do business or any special provisions imposed by states in connection with the resumption of writing new business  our ability to commute our reinsurance agreement and to recapture our reinsured policies  whether our corrective action plan will be accepted and approved by all states  our ability to secure premium rate increases  our ability to meet our future risk based capital goals  the adverse financial impact of suspending new business sales  our ability to raise adequate capital to meet regulatory requirements and to support anticipated growth  the cost associated with recommencing new business sales  liquidity needs and debt obligations  the adequacy of our loss reserves and the recoverability of our dac asset  our ability to sell insurance products in certain states  our ability to resume generating new business in all states  our ability to comply with government regulations and the requirements which may be imposed by state regulators as a result of our capital and surplus levels  the ability of senior citizens to purchase our products in light of the increasing costs of health care  our ability to defend ourselves against adverse litigation  the results of the sec review of our request related to prospective unlocking of future policyholder benefits and our ability to recapture  expand and retain our network of productive independent agents  especially in light of the suspension of new business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in securities and other investments authorized by applicable state laws and regulations and follow an investment policy designed to maximize yield to the extent consistent with liquidity requirements and preservation of assets 
a significant portion of assets and liabilities are financial instruments  which are subject to the market risk of potential losses from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
our primary market risk exposures relate to interest rate risk on fixed rate domestic medium term instruments and  to a lesser extent  domestic short term and long term instruments 
we have established strategies  asset quality standards  asset allocations and other relevant criteria for our portfolio to manage our exposure to market risk 
our financial instruments are held for purposes other than trading 
our portfolio does not contain any significant concentrations in single issuers other than us treasury and agency obligations  industry segments or geographic regions 
although sufficient assets to support our statutory reserve liabilities are secured by trust accounts and irrevocable letters of credit with major united states financial institutions  the accumulated profits of our reinsured business are susceptible to significant credit risk of the reinsurer 
we urge caution in evaluating overall market risk from the information below 
actual results could differ materially because the information was developed using estimates and assumptions as described below  and because insurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables are excluded in the hypothetical effects insurance liabilities represent of total liabilities 
the hypothetical effects of changes in market rates or prices on the fair values of our financial instruments as of december   excluding insurance liabilities and reinsurance receivables on unpaid losses because such insurance related assets and liabilities are not carried at fair value  would have been as follows if interest rates had increased by basis points at december   there would have been a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value of our investment portfolio 
a basis point increase in market rates at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value 
if interest rates had decreased by basis points  there would have been a net increase of approximately million in the net fair value of our total investments 
if interest rates had increased by basis points at december   there would have been a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value of our investment portfolio including our notional experience account less our long term debt 
a basis point increase in market rates at december  would have resulted in a decrease of approximately million in the net fair value 
if interest rates had decreased by basis points  there would have been a net increase of approximately million in the net fair value of our total investments and debt 
we hold certain mortgage and asset backed securities as part of our investment portfolio 
the fair value of these instruments may react in a convex or non linear fashion when subjected to interest rate increases or decreases 
the anticipated cash flows of these instruments may differ from expectations in changing interest rate environments  resulting in duration drift or a varying nature of predicted time weighted present values of cash flows 
the result of unpredicted cash flows from these investments could cause the above hypothetical estimates to change 
we evaluate the impact of changing market interest rates upon these instruments and model the expected impact of changing market rates  duration and convexity in our estimates
