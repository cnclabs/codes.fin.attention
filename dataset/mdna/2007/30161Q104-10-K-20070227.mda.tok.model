item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are committed to developing innovative therapies for cancer and other serious diseases 
through our drug discovery and development activities  we are building a portfolio of novel compounds that we believe have the potential to be high quality  differentiated pharmaceutical products 
utilizing our library of more than four million compounds  we integrate high throughput processes  medicinal chemistry  bioinformatics  structural biology  and early in vivo testing in parallel to characterize thousands of compounds  a process that is designed to enable us to move with speed in research and development 
this approach allows us to select highly qualified drug candidates that meet our extensive list of development criteria from a large pool of compounds 
to date  we have filed investigational new drug applications inds 
we believe that our deep pool of drug candidates will enable us to continue to file multiple new inds each year for the foreseeable future 
as our compounds advance into clinical development  we expect to generate a critical mass of data that will help us to understand the full clinical and commercial potential of our product candidates 
in addition to guiding the potential commercialization of our innovative therapies  these data may contribute to the understanding of disease and help improve treatment outcomes 
our current pipeline includes the following compounds compound principal targets indication stage of development xl egfr  her  vegfr cancer phase ii xl adam  mmp diabetic nephropathy phase ii xl vegfr  pdgfr  fgfr  flt cancer phase ii xl met  vegfr cancer phase ii xl kit  vegfr  pdgfr cancer phase i xl met  vegfr cancer phase i xl chk  chk cancer phase i xl mek cancer ind xl akt  sk cancer ind xl raf cancer ind xl abl  src  igfr cancer ind xl pik cancer preclinical xl pik  mtor cancer preclinical xl jak cancer preclinical xl mr hypertension preclinical xl fxr atherosclerosis preclinical out licensed to symphony evolution  inc and subject to a repurchase option as described in this report 
in co development collaboration with genentech  inc xl and xl are out licensed to sankyo and wyeth pharmaceuticals  respectively  as described in this report 
enrollment of new patients was suspended in november to evaluate safety 
pursuant to a product development and commercialization agreement between exelixis and glaxosmithkline  glaxosmithkline has the option  after completion of clinical proof of concept by exelixis  to elect to develop up to three compounds in exelixis product pipeline  which may include xl and the cancer compounds identified in the table above except xl  xl  xl and xl 
table of contents we have established collaborations with major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies based on the strength of our expertise in biology  drug discovery and development that allow us to retain economic participation in compounds and support additional development of our proprietary products 
through these collaborations  we obtain license fees  research funding  a share of the profits and the opportunity to receive milestone payments and royalties from research results and subsequent product development activities 
we also have collaborations in which we retain the right to co promote products in the united states 
we have ongoing commercial collaborations with several leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including glaxosmithkline  bristol myers squibb company and genentech 
we expect to continue to use corporate partnering as a strategic tool to cultivate our assets  fund our operations and expand the therapeutic and commercial potential of our pipeline 
as our company has matured and our development efforts have intensified  we have restructured our organization as needed to reallocate resources and enhance the efficiency of our operations 
we believe that these efforts have strengthened us by enabling us to achieve an appropriate functional balance within our organization 
certain factors that may affect our business industry wide factors successful development of drugs is inherently difficult and uncertain 
our business requires significant investments in research and development over many years  often for product candidates that fail during the research and development process 
our long term prospects depend upon our ability and the ability of our partners to successfully commercialize new therapeutics in highly competitive areas such as cancer treatment 
company specific factors our performance is driven by many factors  including clinical trials 
we currently have multiple compounds in clinical testing and expect to continue to advance more compounds into clinical development 
our compounds may fail to show safety or efficacy in clinical testing 
furthermore  predicting the timing of the completion or initiation of clinical trials is exceedingly difficult and our trials may be delayed due to many factors  including factors outside of our control 
the future development path of each of our compounds depends upon the results of each stage of clinical development 
in general  we will incur increased operating expenses for compounds that advance to the next stage of clinical development  whereas expenses will end for compounds that do not warrant further clinical development 
liquidity 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities  which included investments held by symphony evolution sei of million and restricted cash and investments of million 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities  investments held by sei and other funding that we expect to receive from collaborators  which assumes a moderate level of business development activity  will enable us to maintain our operations for a period of at least months following december  however  our future capital requirements will be substantial and depend on many factors  including the timing of key events in our agreements with glaxosmithkline and sei that may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we currently anticipate 
we will have to obtain additional funding in order to support our plans for the aggressive development of our broad clinical and preclinical pipelines 
our minimum liquidity needs are also determined by certain financial covenants contained in our loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline  which require us to maintain working capital of at least million and cash and investments of at least million 
our ability to raise additional funds may be severely impaired if any of our product candidates fails to show safety or efficacy in clinical testing 

table of contents reliance on partners 
we currently have no pharmaceutical products that have received marketing approval  and we have generated no revenues from the sale of such products 
we do not expect to generate product revenues from the sale of pharmaceutical products in the near term and expect that all of our revenues  such as milestone and royalty revenues  will be generated from collaboration agreements with our partners 
milestones under these agreements may be tied to factors that are outside of our control  such as significant clinical or regulatory events with respect to compounds that have been licensed to our partners 
glaxosmithkline compound selection 
pursuant to our product development and commercialization agreement with glaxosmithkline  glaxosmithkline has the option  after completion of clinical proof of concept by us  to elect to develop up to three compounds in our product pipeline  which may include xl  xl  xl  xl  xl  xl  xl  xl  xl  xl and two earlier stage oncology programs 
xl  xl and xl have been licensed to sei  as described below 
a compound selection by glaxosmithkline would trigger milestone payments to us 
the size of these milestone payments depends largely on how quickly we can advance compounds to proof of concept 
delays in obtaining clinical proof of concept for compounds subject to glaxosmithkline s election rights may significantly decrease the size of any glaxosmithkline milestones and negatively affect our financial position 
under our loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline  any milestone payments relating to compounds not licensed to sei ie  compounds other than xl  xl and xl must be used to pay down our loan with glaxosmithkline as long as the loan is outstanding and will therefore not affect our cash balances 
in addition  any milestone s received from glaxosmithkline will be reduced by million to account for a milestone that glaxosmithkline advanced to us in as part of an amendment to the product development and commercialization agreement 
symphony evolution 
in  we licensed three of our lead compounds xl  xl and xl to sei in return for million in investment for the clinical development of these compounds 
we continue to be primarily responsible for the development of these compounds in accordance with specified development plans and related development budgets 
we have retained an exclusive option to reacquire the compounds from sei s investors at a specified purchase price 
we may repurchase the compounds in cash  our common stock or a combination thereof 
the repurchase price for the compounds licensed to sei increases over the length of the option period 
if glaxosmithkline elects any of the compounds licensed to sei for further development  we would be forced to repurchase all of the compounds from sei 
if we repurchase the compounds from sei  we may have to raise additional funds to cover the repurchase price or issue a substantial number of shares to sei s investors 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements and related notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting 
table of contents policies reflect the more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition most of our revenues are generated from the terms of our research and licensing arrangements 
these research and licensing arrangements may include up front non refundable payments 
although these up front payments are generally non refundable  under gaap we defer the revenues under these arrangements and recognize the revenues on a straight line basis over our expected period of continuing involvement  generally the research term specified in the agreements 
our research and license arrangements may also include milestone payments 
although these milestone payments are generally non refundable once the milestone is achieved  we recognize the milestone revenues on a straight line basis over the research term of the arrangement 
this typically results in a portion of the milestone being recognized on the date the milestone is achieved  with the balance being recognized over the remaining research term of the agreement 
it is our understanding that there is diversity in practice on the recognition of milestone revenue 
other companies have adopted an alternative acceptable milestone revenue recognition policy whereby the full milestone fee is recognized upon completion of the milestone 
if we had adopted such a policy  our revenues recorded to date would have increased and our deferred revenues would have decreased by a material amount compared to total revenue recognized 
some of our research and licensing arrangements have multiple deliverables in order to meet our customer s needs 
for example  the arrangements may include a combination of up front fees  license payments  research and development services  milestone payments and future royalties 
multiple element revenue agreements entered into on or after july  are evaluated under emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf  to determine whether the delivered item has value to the customer on a stand alone basis and whether objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item exists 
deliverables in an arrangement that do not meet the separation criteria in eitf must be treated as one unit of accounting for purposes of revenue recognition 
generally  the revenue recognition guidance applicable to the final deliverable is followed for the combined unit of accounting 
for certain arrangements  the period of time over which certain deliverables will be provided is not contractually defined 
accordingly  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
for example  we recognized revenue of approximately million in related to arrangements for which the period of time over which the research and development will be performed was not contractually defined 
for this arrangement  if the research and development were delayed  the amount of revenue to be recognized could be different 
to date  there has not been a change in an estimate or assumption in the past that had a material impact on revenue recognition 
goodwill and intangible impairment as of december   our consolidated balance sheet included million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under gaap  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we will also evaluate other intangible assets for impairment when impairment indicators are identified 
the impairment tests for goodwill are performed at the reporting unit level and require us to perform a two step impairment test 
our reporting units have been determined to be consistent with our operating segments 
in the first step  we compare the fair value of our reporting units to their respective carrying values 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit  goodwill is not impaired and we are not required to perform further testing 
if the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit  we perform the second step of the impairment test in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value  then we record an impairment loss equal to the difference 

table of contents determining the fair value of a reporting unit or assessing the recoverability of our other intangible assets is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
we do not believe other reasonable assumptions would have yielded an impairment of goodwill 
actual future results may differ from those estimates 
clinical trial accruals substantial portions of our preclinical studies and all of our clinical trials have been performed by third party contract research organizations cros and other vendors 
we accrue expenses for preclinical studies performed by our vendors based on certain estimates over the term of the service period and adjust our estimates as required 
we accrue costs for clinical trial activities performed by cros based upon the estimated amount of work completed on each study 
for clinical trial expenses  the significant factors used in estimating accruals include the number of patients enrolled and the duration for which they will be enrolled in the study 
we monitor patient enrollment levels and related activities to the extent possible through internal reviews  correspondence with cros and review of contractual terms 
however  if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred 
no material adjustments to preclinical study and clinical trial expenses have been recognized to date 
stock option valuation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  shared based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method and black scholes option pricing model  and therefore have not restated prior periods results 
under this method  we recognize stock based compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted after january  and granted prior to but not yet vested as of january   in accordance with sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we recognize stock based compensation expense net of an estimated forfeiture rate and recognize compensation cost for only those shares expected to vest on a straight line basis over the requisite service period of the award 
prior to sfas r adoption  we accounted for share based payment awards under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
accordingly  no compensation expense was recognized in our financial statements for the stock options granted to employees  which had an exercise price equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
under the new standard  our estimate of compensation expense requires us to determine the appropriate fair value model and a number of complex and subjective assumptions including our stock price volatility  employee exercise patterns  future forfeitures and related tax effects 
the most significant assumptions are our estimates of the expected volatility and the expected term of the award 
we have limited historical information available to support the underlying estimates of certain assumptions required to value stock options 
the value of a stock option is derived from its potential for appreciation 
the more volatile the stock  the more valuable the option becomes because of the greater possibility of significant changes in stock price 
because there is a market for options on our common stock  we have considered implied volatilities as well as our historical realized volatilities when developing an estimate of expected volatility 
the expected option term also has a significant effect on the value of the option 
the longer the term  the more time the option holder has to allow the stock price to increase without a cash investment and thus  the more valuable the option 
further  lengthier option terms provide more opportunity to exploit market highs 
however  empirical data shows that employees  for a variety of reasons  typically do not wait until the end of the contractual term of a nontransferable option to exercise 

table of contents accordingly  companies are required to estimate the expected term of the option for input to an option pricing model 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  from time to time we will likely change the valuation assumptions we use to value stock based awards granted in future periods 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to stock options is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on stock based compensation

table of contents research and development funding totaling million 
this decrease was partially offset by increases in funding of million from bristol myers squibb  million in funding attributable to customers of our german subsidiary and million in funding from genentech 
the increase in research and development funding from to was driven primarily by increases in funding of million from glaxosmithkline  million in funding from the recognition of an early termination fee associated with the termination of our genoptera collaboration and million in funding from genentech 
the increase in milestone revenues from to was driven primarily by achieving and recognizing as revenue milestones of million under our collaboration with wyeth pharmaceutical division and a million milestone under our collaboration with helsinn and million in revenues associated with achieving two milestones under one of our collaborations with bristol myers squibb 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in milestone revenues related to the conclusion of our genoptera collaboration in june the increase in milestone revenues from to was driven primarily by million in revenues associated with achieving two milestones under our collaboration with glaxosmithkline and a million acceleration of milestone revenues associated with the termination of our genoptera collaboration 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million in milestone revenues related to the termination of one of our bristol myers squibb collaborations 
the increase in revenues from to from the delivery of compounds of million was related to the delivery of compounds under our chemistry collaboration agreement with bayer cropscience 
the decrease in revenues from to from the delivery of compounds was due to the termination of most of our chemistry collaborations effective december  these collaborations included agreements with cytokintetics  elan  schering plough  scios and merck 
the increase from to in the amortization of upfront payments  including premiums paid on equity purchases  was driven primarily by upfront payments from sankyo  resulting in increased revenues of million  wyeth  resulting in increased revenues of million  and bristol myers squibb  resulting in increased revenues of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million related to the conclusion of our genoptera collaboration in june  which included acceleration of upfront payments  and by a decrease of million related to the conclusion of our collaboration with helsinn 
the increase from to was driven primarily by an additional million in revenues from the acceleration of upfront payments associated with the termination of our genoptera collaboration  upfront payments from helsinn that resulted in increased revenues of million and the upfront payment from genentech that resulted in increased revenues of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of million related to the termination of one of our bristol myers squibb collaborations

facilities facilities expense increased by million  or  primarily due to our expansion into two additional buildings in south san francisco  california largely as a result of our expanding development operations 
we occupied the first building in july and the second in july the increase was also attributable to an additional building lease in san diego  california  which we assumed in connection with our acquisition of x ceptor in october 
table of contents lab supplies lab supplies expense decreased by million  or  primarily due to the termination of most of our combinatorial chemistry collaborations 
we generally estimate that typical phase i clinical trials last approximately one year  phase ii clinical trials last approximately one to two years and phase iii clinical trials last approximately two to four years 
however  the length of time may vary substantially according to factors relating to the specific clinical trial  such as the type and intended use of the product candidate  the clinical trial design and ability to enroll suitable patients 
we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase as we advance our compounds through development 
we currently do not have estimates of total costs to reach the market by a particular drug candidate or in total 
our potential therapeutic products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain regulatory process that may involve unanticipated additional clinical trials and that may not result in the necessary regulatory approvals 
failure to receive the necessary regulatory approvals would prevent us from commercializing the product candidates affected 
in addition  clinical trials of our potential products may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy  which could prevent or significantly delay regulatory approval 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and development  including the purchase of property and equipment  to support our expanding preclinical and clinical development operations

table of contents intangible assets result from our acquisitions of x ceptor  genomica  artemis and agritope renamed exelixis plant sciences 
these assets are amortized over specified time periods 
the decrease in amortization of intangibles expense in as compared to was due to the developed technology intangible asset related to our acquisition of artemis in becoming fully amortized in october the increase in amortization expense in compared to was due to the partial year amortization in of the assembled workforce that we acquired as a part of x ceptor in october restructuring charges during the second quarter of  we implemented a restructuring and consolidation of our research and discovery organizations 
the restructuring included a reduction in force of employees  the majority of whom were research personnel located in south san francisco  california 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million during the year ended december   comprised of involuntary termination benefits 
during the third quarter of  we implemented a restructuring of our research and development organization that was substantially complete as of march  in connection with this restructuring plan  we recorded a cumulative charge of million  of which million was recorded during the year ended december  this charge consisted primarily of severance payments  retention bonuses  relocation costs  lease buyout costs and legal and outplacement services fees 
acquired in process research and development in may  we purchased from bayer cropscience its interest in agrinomics llc  our joint venture with bayer cropscience  in exchange for releasing bayer cropscience from all future obligations under the joint venture agreement 
we recorded the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition  as determined by management based on valuation techniques in accordance with gaap 
as a result  we recorded net tangible liabilities of million  intangible assets of million and expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  representing the fair value of two primary research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
in october  we completed the acquisition of x ceptor  a company focused on the discovery and development of therapies targeting metabolic and cardiovascular disorders 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets 
the total consideration for the acquisition was million  which consisted of million shares of our common stock  million in cash and million in transaction costs 
the transaction costs included financial advisory  legal  accounting and other fees 
as a result  we recorded tangible assets of million  liabilities of million  assembled workforce of million and expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of million  representing the fair value of three primary research projects that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use due to the early stage of the programs and the significant regulatory requirements remaining 
independent valuation experts assisted us during the valuation of the intangible assets acquired 
the valuation of the acquired in process research and development of million was determined using the income approach for each of the three projects in process 
the in process projects relate to the development of programs that are focused on lxr  valued at million  fxr  valued at million  and mr  valued at million  which at the time of the acquisition were expected to be completed over approximately the next seven to ten years 
at the time of the acquisition  these programs did not have a development candidate 
in december and march  we entered into license and collaboration agreements under which we granted licenses to wyeth  bristol myers squibb and sankyo to the intellectual property related to fxr  lxr and mr  respectively 
the income approach estimates the value of each acquired project in process based on its expected future cash flows 
the valuation analysis considered the percent complete of each in process research and development 
table of contents project 
the expected present value of the cash flows associated with the in process research and development projects was computed using a risk adjusted rate of return of which is considered commensurate with the inherent risk and percentage of completion of the in process projects 
the purchased technology was not considered to have reached technological feasibility and since it has no alternative future use due to the early stage of the programs  the considerable complexity and uniqueness of the programs and the significant regulatory requirements remaining  it was recorded as a component of operating expense 
the revenues  expenses  cash flows and other assumptions underlying the estimated fair value of the acquired in process research and development involve significant risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties associated with completing the acquired in process projects include obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals in a timely manner and being able to successfully and profitably produce  distribute and sell products

table of contents shareholders of sei and net proceeds of million received through the sale of our common stock 
in addition  we received million in cash from the purchase of million shares of our common stock by glaxosmithkline  which included a million premium 
we finance property and equipment purchases through equipment financing facilities  such as notes and bank obligations 
proceeds from collaboration loans and common stock issuances are used for general working capital purposes  such as research and development activities  merger and acquisition expenses and other general corporate purposes 
during  we have the ability to draw up to an additional million on an equipment line of credit 
over the next several years  we are required to make certain payments on notes  bank obligations and loans from collaborators 
cash requirements we have incurred net losses since inception  including a net loss of million for the month period ended december   and we expect to incur substantial losses for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development activities  including manufacturing and development expenses for compounds in preclinical and clinical studies 
we anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities  investments held by sei and other funding that we expect to receive from collaborators  which assumes a moderate level of business development activity  will enable us to maintain our operations for a period of at least months following december  however  our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors that may require us to consume available capital resources significantly sooner than we currently anticipate 
these factors include the timing and progress of the clinical development of our product candidates xl  xl and xl  which are out licensed to sei if any of the phase ii clinical trials for xl  xl or xl show positive results that support our further clinical development of any such product candidate  we must  if we decide to further develop such product candidate s  reacquire all three product candidates from sei through the exercise of our exclusive purchase option  which is described in this report 
under our amended purchase option agreement with sei  we cannot repurchase a single promising product candidate from sei without also repurchasing the other two product candidates 
the purchase price  which may be paid in cash and or stock  would be equal to the sum of i the total amount of capital invested in sei by its investors ie  million and ii an amount equal to per year on such funded capital  subject to specified adjustments  whether and when glaxosmithkline selects at proof of concept ie  at or around the end of phase iia clinical trials for further development xl  xl or xl  which would require us to repurchase all three product candidates through the exercise of our purchase option glaxosmithkline has the right to select for further clinical development at proof of concept any of the product candidates licensed to sei 
if glaxosmithkline selects any of the product candidates licensed to sei  we would be forced to repurchase all three product candidates licensed to sei through the exercise of our purchase option in order to satisfy our contractual obligations under the glaxosmithkline collaboration agreement  the amount of any selection milestones received from glaxosmithkline as a result of a product candidate selection by glaxosmithkline compared to the amount we are required to pay to reacquire xl  xl and xl through the exercise of our purchase option under our collaboration agreement with glaxosmithkline  a product candidate selection by glaxosmithkline would trigger milestone payments 
the size of these milestone payments depends largely on how quickly we can advance product candidates to proof of concept 
delays in obtaining clinical proof of concept for xl  xl or xl may significantly decrease the size of any glaxosmithkline milestones  which may therefore cover only a small portion of the sei repurchase price 
in addition  any milestone s received from glaxosmithkline will be reduced by million to account for a milestone that glaxosmithkline advanced to us in as part of an amendment to the product development and commercialization agreement  
table of contents whether any milestone payments from glaxosmithkline relate to a product candidate licensed to sei ie  xl  xl and xl under our loan and security agreement with glaxosmithkline  any milestone payments relating to product candidates not licensed to sei must be used to pay down our loan with glaxosmithkline as long as the loan is outstanding 
as of december   the aggregate principal and interest outstanding under our glaxosmithkline loan was million  the level of payments received under existing collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements as well as our ability to enter into new collaboration agreements  licensing agreements and other arrangements that provide for additional payments  our ability to remain in compliance with  or amend or cause to be waived  financial covenants contained in agreements with third parties  the progress and scope of our collaborative and independent clinical trials and other research and development projects  future clinical trial results  our need to expand our product and clinical development efforts  our ability to share the costs of our clinical development efforts with third parties  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of clinical and research supplies of our product candidates  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the filing  maintenance  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the cost of any acquisitions of or investments in businesses  products and technologies  and the cost and timing of establishing or contracting for sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
in addition  we will have to obtain additional funding in order to stay in compliance with financial covenants contained in our collaboration with glaxosmithkline 
under a loan and security agreement  dated october   which  as amended  contains financial covenants pursuant to which our working capital the amount by which our current assets exceed our current liabilities as defined by the agreement must not be less than million and our cash and investments total cash  cash equivalents and investments as defined by the agreement  which excludes restricted cash must not be less than million 
if we were to default on the financial covenants under the loan and security agreement  glaxosmithkline may  among other remedies  declare immediately due and payable all outstanding obligations thereunder 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will have to raise additional funds 
we currently have shelf registration statements on file with the sec that allow us to offer for sale from time to time common stock  preferred stock  debt securities and warrants  either individually or in units 
however  we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets and enter into covenants that would restrict certain business activities or our ability to incur further indebtedness and may contain other terms that are not favorable to our stockholders or us 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 

table of contents we have contractual obligations in the form of operating leases  notes payable and licensing agreements 
the following chart details our contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years notes payable and bank obligations licensing agreements convertible loans operating leases total contractual cash obligations includes interest payable on the convertible loans of million 
the debt and interest payable can be repaid in cash or common stock at our election 
this obligation is described in further detail in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
if glaxosmithkline were to select one of the compounds licensed by us to symphony evolution for further clinical development  we would be required to exercise our option to repurchase all three compounds licensed to symphony evolution in order to be able to satisfy our obligations under our agreements with glaxosmithkline

recent accounting pronouncement in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing the recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and is required to be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss and credit carryforwards of approximately million that may be subject to annual limitation  due to certain substantial changes in ownership  under the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating loss and credit carryforwards before utilization 
as of december   all of our deferred tax assets have been fully offset by a valuation allowance because the realization of these assets is dependent upon future earnings 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of fin will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
because our deferred tax assets are fully offset by a valuation allowance  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on our results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined by applicable sec regulations that are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  except warrants and stock options 
our off balance sheet arrangements are described in further detail in notes and of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our financing arrangement with symphony evolution sei does not qualify as an off balance sheet arrangement as defined by applicable sec regulations 
however  if glaxosmithkline were to select one of the compounds licensed by us to sei for further clinical development  we would have to exercise our option to repurchase all of the compounds licensed to sei in order to be able to satisfy our obligations under our agreements with glaxosmithkline 
this obligation is described in further detail in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  investments held by sei and restricted cash and investments of million and million  respectively 
our marketable securities and investments are subject to interest rate risk  and our interest income may fluctuate due to changes in us interest rates 
by policy  we limit our investments to money market instruments  debt securities of us government agencies and debt obligations of us corporations 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and consequently are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of estimated income taxes 
we manage market risk through diversification requirements mandated by our investment policy  which limits the amount of our portfolio that can be invested in a single issuer 
we manage credit risk by limiting our purchases to high quality issuers 
through our money managers  we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate risk 
the risk management control systems use analytical techniques  including sensitivity analysis 
at december  and  we had debt and capital leases outstanding of million and million  respectively 
our payment commitments associated with these debt instruments are fixed during the corresponding terms and are comprised of interest payments  principal payments or a combination thereof 
the fair value of our debt will fluctuate with movements of interest rates  increasing in periods of declining rates of interest  and declining in periods of increasing rates of interest 
we have estimated the effects on our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities based on a one percentage point hypothetical adverse change in interest rates as of december  and as of december  and  a decrease in the interest rates of one percentage point would have had a net adverse change in the fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of million and million  respectively 
we have assumed that the changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument containing interest rate risks 
significant variations in market interest rates could produce changes in the timing of repayments due to available prepayment options 
the fair value of such instruments could be affected and  therefore  actual results might differ from our estimate
