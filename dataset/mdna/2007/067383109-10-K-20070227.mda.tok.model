table of contents new accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
the intent of fin is to clarify the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
this interpretation imposes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this interpretation is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year beginning after december  bard will be required to adopt this interpretation in the first quarter of the company is evaluating the requirements of fin and estimates that this adoption will increase retained earnings between million and million in in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements fas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of fas are effective as of the beginning of bard s fiscal year 
the company is currently evaluating the impact this adoption will have on the consolidated financial statements 
management s use of non gaap measures net sales on a constant currency basis and ongoing net sales are non gaap financial measures 
the company analyzes net sales on a constant currency and ongoing basis to better measure the comparability of results between periods 
because changes in foreign currency exchange rates have a non operating impact on net sales  the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales on a constant currency basis provides an additional and meaningful assessment of net sales 
constant currency growth rates are calculated by translating the prior year s local currency sales by the current period s exchange rate 
constant currency growth rates are not indicative of changes in corresponding cash flows 
during  the company disposed of certain assets  the net sales of which are reported in the oncology products group 
the company believes that evaluating growth in net sales of the products from operating assets which were not divested  or ongoing net sales  provides an additional and meaningful assessment of comparable operations 
the limitation of these non gaap measures is that  by excluding certain items  they do not reflect results on a standardized reporting basis 
all non gaap financial measures are intended to supplement the applicable gaap disclosures and should not be viewed as a replacement for gaap results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in the company s notes to consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
the critical accounting policies described below are areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result 
revenue recognition the company recognizes product revenue  net of discounts and rebates  when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  title and risk of loss has transferred  the buyer s price is fixed or determinable  contractual obligations have been satisfied and collectibility is reasonably assured 
unless agreed otherwise  the company s terms with domestic distributors provide that title and risk of loss passes fob origin 
certain sales to domestic and european distributors are fob destination 
for arrangements where the company s terms state fob destination  the company records sales on this basis 
in the case of consignment inventories  revenues and associated costs are recognized upon the notification of usage by the customer 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
for most domestic divisions cost is determined using the last in first out lifo method 
for all other inventories cost is determined using the ii 
table of contents first in first out fifo method 
due to changing technologies and cost containment the difference between the inventory valuation under the lifo method and the fifo method is not significant 
share based compensation the company accounts for share based compensation in accordance with fas r  as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we utilize a binomial model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
the company s expected volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of the company s stock and the implied volatility from publicly traded options 
the company reviews the trading volumes and option life of its publicly traded options in order to determine the appropriate weighting of implied volatility 
this approach is used as a predictor of future realized and implied volatilities and is directly related to stock option valuations 
for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended december  the company used a weighted average expected stock price volatility of percent based upon a weighting of percent historical volatility and percent implied volatility at the time of issuance 
with respect to the weighted average option life assumption  the company considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
for stock option grants issued during the fiscal year ended december   the company assumed a weighted average expected option life of years 
as share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
fas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
legal reserve estimates the company is at times involved in legal actions  the outcomes of which are not within the company s complete control and may not be known for prolonged periods of time 
in some cases  the claimants seek damages  as well as other relief  which  if granted  could require significant expenditures 
a liability is recorded in the company s consolidated financial statements for these actions when a loss is known or considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
if the loss is not probable or cannot be reasonably estimated  a liability is not recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
tax estimates the company has filed tax returns with positions that may be challenged by the tax authorities 
these positions relate to  among others  the allocation and or recognition of income on intercompany transactions  the timing and amount of deductions and the tax treatment of acquisitions and divestitures 
although the outcome of tax audits is uncertain  in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for potential liabilities resulting from such matters 
the company regularly assesses its tax position for such matters and includes reserves for those differences in position 
the reserves are utilized or reversed once the statute of limitations has expired or the matter is otherwise resolved 
the company believes that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not have a material impact on its financial position or liquidity but may be material to the income tax provision and net income in a future period 
the company operates in multiple taxing jurisdictions  both within the united states and outside the united states 
the company faces audits from these various tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due 
such audits can involve complex issues and may require an extended period of time to resolve 
the company s us federal tax filings have been examined by the irs for calendar years ending prior to the company believes all tax differences arising from those audits have been resolved and settled

allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns management makes estimates of the uncollectibility of the company s accounts receivable  amounts that are rebated to specific customers in accordance with contractual requirements and inventory adjustments to reflect inventory valuation at the lower of cost or market 
in estimating the reserves necessary for the allowance for doubtful accounts  management considers historical bad debt trends  customer concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated amounts that are uncollectible from customers 
in estimating the allowance for customer rebates  management considers the lag time between the point of sale and the payment of the customer s rebate claim  customer specific trend analysis and contractual commitments including the stated rebate rate 
the company establishes an allowance for customer rebates and reduces sales for such rebate amounts 
in estimating the adjustment for inventory writedowns  management considers product obsolescence  quantity on hand  future demand for the product and other market related conditions 
the company records an adjustment for inventory writedowns when such conditions cause the inventory market value to be below carrying value 
the company records such adjustments to cost of sales in the period the condition exists 
it is possible that the underlying factors discussed above for the allowance for doubtful accounts  customer rebates and inventory writedowns could change 
depending on the extent and nature of the change to the underlying factors  the impact to the company s financial position and results of operations could be material in the period of change 
valuation of purchased r d  goodwill and intangible assets when the company acquires another company  the purchase price is allocated  as applicable  between purchased r d  other identifiable intangible assets  tangible assets and goodwill as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
purchased r d is defined as the value assigned to those projects for which the related products have not received regulatory approval and have no alternative future use 
determining the portion of the purchase price allocated to purchased r d and other intangible assets requires the company to make significant estimates 
the amount of the purchase price allocated to purchased r d and other intangible assets is determined by estimating the future cash flows of each project or technology and discounting the net cash flows back to their present values 
the discount rate used is determined at the time of the acquisition in accordance with accepted valuation methods 
for purchased r d  these methodologies include consideration of the risk of the project not achieving commercial feasibility 
goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of net assets  including purchased r d  of the acquired businesses 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually  or more frequently if changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest an impairment exists 
the test for impairment requires the company to make several estimates about fair value  most of which are based on projected future cash flows 
the company s estimates associated with the goodwill impairment tests are considered critical due to the amount of goodwill recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheets and the judgment required in determining fair value amounts  including projected future cash flows 
ii 
table of contents intangible assets consist primarily of patents and other intellectual property  which are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
the company reviews these intangible assets for impairment annually or as changes in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggest the remaining value is not recoverable 
pension plans the company sponsors pension plans covering substantially all domestic employees and certain foreign employees who meet eligibility requirements 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of future compensation increases as determined by the company  within certain guidelines 
in addition  the company s actuarial consultants also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to estimate these factors 
the actuarial assumptions used by the company may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter life spans of the participants 
these differences may have a significant effect on the amount of pension expense recorded by the company 
risks and uncertainties  cautionary statement regarding forward looking information certain statements contained herein or in other company documents and certain statements that may be made by management of the company orally may contain forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historic or current facts 
they use words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  forecast  plan  believe and other words and terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
in particular  these include statements relating to product approvals  future performance of current and anticipated products  sales efforts  expenses  the outcome of contingencies  such as legal proceedings  and financial results 
in addition  there are substantial risks inherent in the medical device business 
the company s business involves the design  development  manufacture  packaging  distribution and sale of life sustaining medical devices 
these devices are often utilized on  or permanently or temporarily implanted in  seriously ill patients in clinically demanding circumstances  such as operating rooms  emergency units  intensive care and critical care settings  among others 
these circumstances  among other factors  can cause the products to become associated with adverse clinical events  including patient mortality and injury  and could lead to product liability claims and other litigation  product withdrawals  recalls  field corrections or regulatory enforcement actions relating to one or more of the company s products  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
because actual results are affected by these and other risks and uncertainties  the company cautions investors that actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied 
it is not possible to predict or identify all risks and uncertainties  but the most significant factors  in addition to those addressed above and those under the heading risk factors  that could adversely affect our business or cause the actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied include  but are not limited to effective management of and reaction to risks involved in our business  including the ability to achieve manufacturing or administrative efficiencies  including gross margin benefits from our manufacturing process and supply chain programs or in connection with the integration of acquired businesses  the effects of negative publicity concerning our products  which could result in product withdrawals or decreased product demand and which could reduce market or governmental acceptance of our products  ii

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk bard operates on a global basis and therefore is subject to the exposures that arise from foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
the company manages these exposures using operational and economic hedges as well as derivative financial instruments 
the company s foreign currency exposures may change over time as changes occur in the company s international operations 
the company s objective in managing its exposures to foreign currency fluctuations is to minimize earnings and cash flow volatility associated with assets  liabilities  net investments and probable commitments denominated in foreign currencies 
in order to reduce the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the company will from time to time enter into derivative financial instruments to hedge a portion of its expected foreign currency denominated cash flow from operations 
the instruments that the company uses for hedging are forward contracts and options with major financial institutions 
the company expects that the changes in fair market value of such contracts will have a high correlation to the price changes in the related hedged cash flow 
the principal currencies the company hedges are the euro  the british pound  the mexican peso and the japanese yen 
any gains and losses on these hedge contracts are expected to offset changes in the value of the related exposure 
bard s risk management guidelines prohibit entering into financial instruments for speculative purposes 
the company enters into foreign currency transactions only to the extent that foreign currency exposure exists 
a sensitivity analysis of changes in the fair value of all foreign exchange derivative contracts at december  indicates that if the us dollar uniformly strengthened by against all currencies  the fair value of these contracts would increase by million  and if the us dollar uniformly weakened by against all currencies  the fair value of these contracts would increase by million 
any gains and losses on the fair value of derivative contracts would be largely ii 
table of contents offset by gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
these offsetting gains and losses are not reflected in the above analysis 
in december  the company issued million of notes due note holders had a one time option to redeem the notes at par value on december   and accordingly  the company had classified the notes as current during the month period ending december  in the fourth quarter of  approximately million of the notes were redeemed and the remaining balance of approximately million has been reclassified as long term debt 
the market value of the notes approximates million at december  assuming a basis point increase or decrease in us interest rates and assuming that the notes are held to maturity  the market value of the notes would approximate million or million  respectively  on december  ii
