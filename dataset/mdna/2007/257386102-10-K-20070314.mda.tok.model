table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a leading builder of high quality homes and condominiums in central ohio primarily the columbus metropolitan statistical area and louisville and lexington  kentucky 
our customer driven focus targets primarily entry level and move up home buyers 
we offer a variety of homes and condominiums that are differentiated by price  size  included features and available options 
our homes range in price from approximately  to  and in size from approximately  to  square feet 
reduced revenues  combined with a higher cost of sales as a percentage of revenues  resulted in a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the twelve months ended december  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for the twelve months ended december  net income for the twelve months ended december  was million  or per diluted share 
the decline in profitability over this period reflects lower unit sales and reductions in our gross profit margins to in compared to in and in the substantial decline in gross margin that occurred during  as well as the smaller decline from to  reflect intensified pricing pressure in our markets  significant reductions in volume  charges to cost of real estate sold related to real estate inventory impairments and the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs incurred for land that we decided not to purchase 
these non cash charges reduced gross margin by in  in and in gross margins excluding these items would have been in  in and in our geographic markets were historically relatively stable markets for new home sales 
however  from through the early part of  new home sales in our markets were particularly strong and resulted in record sales levels for us 
then  in mid  new home sales in our markets began to slow and that trend has continued through we believe the reasons for this slowdown include a decline in the overall demand for new homes  slowing sales and price competition in the resale home market  increased supply of existing home inventory  increased interest rates compared to prior years  a lower level of consumer confidence and slower economic activity in our markets 
during  we delivered  homes with revenues of million  compared to  homes with revenues of million during and  homes with revenues of million in we sold  homes with a sales volume of million during compared to  homes with a sales value of million during and  homes with a sales value of million in our year end backlog  which consists of homes sold but not yet delivered  declined approximately to sales contracts  with an aggregate sales value of million at december   from sales contracts  with an aggregate sales value of million in the average sales value of homes in backlog at year end declined approximately from the prior year 
in response to the declining sales volumes  we implemented an initial series of cost cutting initiatives in late and continued to aggressively manage and control all overhead 
table of contents expenses throughout for the twelve months ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses declined to million from million in selling  general and administrative expenses were million in which indicates a reduction over the two year period 
the primary reasons for the year over year declines were reductions in headcount  stricter cost controls and lower sales and incentive compensation expenses as a result of decreased home deliveries and net income 
we expect the reduced cost structure will continue to generate additional cost reductions from the levels as the impact of these initiatives is fully reflected in the operating results 
on a quarterly basis  selling  general and administrative expense was million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
our land position  which had grown to support the sales levels that were achieved during and  became disproportionate to the lower demand for our homes that we experienced during and in response to the sales downturn  we slowed the acquisition of land not required for immediate use and delayed the commencement of construction activities for some land that was not already in the development process 
in addition  in we sold million of land and recognized gains of million and in we sold million of land and recognized gains of million in cost of real estate sold includes land or real estate impairment charges and write offs of costs and deposits for land we decided not to purchase of million in and million in we evaluate the recoverability of our real estate inventories each quarter in accordance with sfas no 
our analysis includes factors such as the recent level of sales activity  estimated average selling prices  estimated sales  absorption rates  gross margin trends  projected cash flows and planned development activities for each community 
as a result of weakening sales trends and compression of gross margins in late  we recorded million of these charges in the fourth quarter of our land inventory  including estimated lots to be developed on unimproved land  was reduced by to  lots at december  from  lots at december  and  lots at december  based on the  closings that took place in  our land inventory represented an year supply versus our target of maintaining a four to six year supply 
as a result  we expect to continue to reduce our total investment in land inventories during by selling raw land and developed lots that are not required in the near term  delaying significant land acquisitions and continuing to limit land development activities to those subdivisions where we do not have an adequate supply of developed lots 
as of december   land held for sale was million representing approximately  lots 
on march   we entered into a new joint venture  centennial home mortgage  llc centennial with wells fargo bank  na and its wholly owned subsidiary wells fargo ventures  llc collectively  wells fargo 
centennial is currently operating as a full service mortgage bank to our customers and the general public 
centennial provides our customers access to a full range of competitively priced mortgage products from a aaa rated mortgage lender and nationally recognized loan servicer 
our mortgage financing services subsidiary  dominion homes financial services dhfs  ceased day to day operations during the fourth quarter of after it had fully satisfied all commitments to borrowers for loans 

table of contents on december   the company  all of its participating lenders  the huntington national bank as administrative agent  and silver point finance  llc  as senior administrative agent entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility for the amendment of our existing credit facilities 
subsequently  on january  and march   the company and its lenders agreed to amend certain provisions and covenants of the credit facility 
the amended credit facility will now terminate on december  the credit facility includes i a million senior secured revolving line of credit the revolving line of credit  ii a million senior secured term a loan facility term a notes  and iii a million senior secured second lien term b loan facility term b notes 
the variable interest rate on the revolving line of credit and the term a notes of at december  is slightly higher than the rate which applied to the entire facility prior to the amendment 
the term b notes bear interest at a fixed interest rate of and include detachable stock purchase warrants for  common shares of the company  which  if exercised  would represent approximately of our fully diluted common shares 
we believe that the amended credit facility should provide adequate liquidity to weather an anticipated loss in as a result of the expected continued weakness in the housing market  and should allow the company to be well positioned when conditions in the home building market become more favorable 
additional information regarding the amended credit facility is provided below under contractual obligations and liquidity and capital resources

seasonality and variability in quarterly results our business is significantly affected by changes in economic cycles and activity in the markets where we build homes 
we historically have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  variability in results on a quarterly basis 
closing on a home usually occurs approximately three to six months after the date of the sales contract  however  weather and other delays may cause the closing to take longer

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as percentages of total revenues  as well as certain operating data year ended december  consolidated statements of operations data revenues cost of real estate sold gross profit selling  general and administrative income loss from operations interest expense income loss before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income loss operating data unaudited homes sales contracts  net of cancellations closings backlog at period end average sales price of homes closed during the period in thousands average sales price of homes in backlog at period end in thousands aggregate sales value of homes in backlog at period end in thousands we include a home in sales contracts when a home buyer signs our standard sales contract  which requires a deposit and generally has no contingencies other than for purchaser financing or for the sale of an existing home  or both 
homes in backlog represent our signed sales contract  for which the closing has not occurred as of the end of the period 
we recognize revenue and cost of real estate sold at the time of closing 
closings or deliveries occur when ownership has transferred to the home buyer 
homes included in sales contracts in the foregoing table are net of cancellations 
most cancellations occur when home buyers cannot qualify for financing or cannot sell an existing home 
our average cancellation rate was  and in  and  respectively 
compared to revenues 
our revenues for were million from the delivery of  homes compared to million from the delivery of  homes during despite delivering fewer homes  the average delivery price of homes for of  remained consistent with the  average delivery price for homes in contributing to the decline in 
table of contents revenues was our decision to wind down the operations of our mortgage financing services subsidiary dhfs 
our revenues included fee revenue from dhfs of million compared to million in as of december  dhfs had ceased day to day operations 
during  we did not sell any homes for lease back as models 
revenues for included the sale of model homes  with a sales value of million  which we leased back for use as sales models 
gross profit 
our gross profit as a percentage of net revenues for declined to in compared to in one factor contributing to the decline in gross profit margin was larger sales discounts  which increased to of gross revenues for compared to of gross revenues for thus reducing our net revenue and lowering the gross profit recognized per home closing 
the major components of gross profit margin for and were percent of house cost before sales discounts percent of house cost before sales discounts sales discounts land construction costs other costs the other costs item in the above table includes a million non cash charge to cost of real estate sold related to real estate inventory impairment charges and the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs incurred for land that we decided not to purchase and  of gains from land sales of million 
included in other costs is a similar charge of million related to the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs incurred for land we decided not to purchase and million of gains from land sales of million 
these transactions reduced our gross profit margin by and in and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million for compared to million for  principally as a result of delivering fewer homes and our efforts to better align the scale of our operations with our current sales pace 
the primary factors that contributed to the decline in total selling  general and administrative expense were a reduction in the number of total employees to as of december  from as of december   the close out of dhfs operations during  lower sales commissions due to fewer home deliveries and stringent cost controls implemented during in addition  we reduced the salaries of certain executives and eliminated most incentive compensation plans for on a quarterly basis  selling  general and administrative expense was million in the first quarter  million in the second quarter  million in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter 
although total selling  general and administrative expenses declined from to  it increased as a percentage of revenues to for from in this is due to the fact that certain corporate expenses  including public company reporting and compliance costs  real estate taxes and building occupancy costs are typically fixed and certain other corporate items such as insurance  information technology  architecture  accounting  and legal expenses are not directly related to increases or decreases in revenues 

table of contents interest expense 
our interest expense was million for compared to million for the increase is due to having a higher average borrowing rate and slightly higher average borrowings outstanding  offset by million more interest capitalized in than our weighted average borrowing rate for  excluding amortization of bank fees  increased to in compared to in our average borrowings outstanding were relatively constant at million for compared to million for provision benefit for income taxes 
our income tax benefit for was million compared to income tax expense of million for the company s annual effective tax rate decreased to for compared to for the decrease is primarily a result of our establishment of a full million valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets based on the uncertainty regarding the future realization through future taxable income or carryback opportunities 
if in the future the company believes that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax benefits will be realized  the valuation allowances will be reversed 
the effective income tax rate was also impacted by an  reduction of prior year tax liabilities resulting from favorable tax settlements 
compared to revenues 
our revenues for decreased by to million from the delivery of  homes compared to revenues for of million from the delivery of  homes 
during  the average delivered price of homes increased to  from  for and partially offset the loss in revenues caused by delivering fewer homes 
revenues for include million from the sale of homes that we leased back for use as sales models 
revenues for include million from the sale of homes that we leased back for use as sales models 
total revenues include fee revenue from our mortgage financing services subsidiary 
during  these fee revenues decreased to million for from million for this was primarily because of the reduction in the number of home buyers for whom we provided mortgage financing services 
we provided mortgage financing services to  or approximately  of our home buyers during compared to  or approximately  of our home buyers during gross profit 
our gross profit for decreased by to million from million for  primarily due to the fewer number of homes delivered  the reduction in mortgage financing services income as discussed above  higher sales discounts  higher costs of real estate and higher construction costs compared to in addition  cost of real estate sold for includes reserves and write offs of costs and deposits for land we decided not to purchase of approximately million and gains on land sales of approximately million 
cost of real estate sold for includes similar reserves and write offs of costs and deposits for land we decided not to purchase of approximately million 
as a percentage of revenues  our gross profit margin declined to for from for 
table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for decreased by to million from million for the primary reasons for the year over year decline were a reduction in headcount  stricter cost controls and lower sales and incentive compensation expenses as a result of decreased home deliveries and net income 
interest expense 
our interest expense for increased by to million from million for due to having higher average borrowings outstanding and a higher average borrowing rate 
our average revolving line of credit borrowings outstanding increased to million for compared to million for due to increased investment in land and land development 
in addition  the weighted average borrowing rate for  excluding amortization of bank fees  increased to from for provision for income taxes 
our income tax expense for decreased to million from million for our annual effective tax rate decreased to for  from for  primarily due to a reduction of estimated tax liabilities for prior years resulting from favorable tax audit settlements  a charitable contribution of appreciated property  and statutory tax changes in ohio and kentucky 
these reductions were partially offset by estimated additional state taxes related to previously filed tax returns 
liquidity and capital resources historically  our capital needs have depended on sales volume  asset turnover  land acquisition and inventory levels 
our traditional sources of capital have been internally generated cash  bank borrowings and seller financing in connection with our land purchases 
at times  we also have sold our common shares in the public market 
we have incurred indebtedness in the past and expect to incur indebtedness in the future to fund our operations and fund our investment in real estate inventories 
on december   the company  all of the participating lenders  the huntington national bank as administrative agent  and silver point finance  llc  as senior administrative agent entered into the third amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility for the amendment of our existing credit facilities 
subsequently  on january  and march   the company and its lenders agreed to amend certain provisions and covenants of the credit facility 
the amended credit facility terminates on december  the credit facility includes i a million senior unsecured revolving line of credit  ii a million senior secured term a loan facility  and iii a million senior secured second lien term b loan facility with detachable warrants exercisable for  common shares of the company 
we rely on the cash flow from home sale closings  proceeds from the sale of land and developed lots and funds from our credit facility to meet our short term cash obligations 
the primary reasons that we could require additional capital are sustained operating deficits  recoveries and expansions in our existing markets that would require us to fund the development of additional lot and homes under construction inventories or purchase of a homebuilding company 
see part i  item ia risk factors our business is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in national and local economic  business and other conditions  most of which are beyond our control 

table of contents during we slowed the acquisition of additional land and delayed the commencement of construction activities for land not already in the development process 
we also identified various land parcels and developed lots that we are offering for sale and have classified these parcels and lots as land held for sale as of december  we will continue to evaluate our land holdings and expect that we may identify additional excess inventory that will be offered for sale 
we believe that by limiting future land acquisition and development activities  selling excess inventory of undeveloped land and developed lots and reducing our developed lot inventories through the sale of new homes  we will be able to significantly reduce our total investment in land inventories and apply a significant portion of the proceeds toward reducing outstanding borrowings 
sources and uses of cash for the three year period ended december  our net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in the improvement was primarily attributable to significant reductions in our real estate inventories as a result of home closings  land sales and slowed land acquisition and development activities 
the change in real estate inventories during included land sales of million  which generated gains on sale of  and million of non cash impairment charges and write offs of land and lot option deposits and pre acquisition costs 
the change in real estate inventories during included land sales of million  which generated gains on sale of million  and million of non cash impairment charges and write offs of land and lot option deposits and pre acquisition costs 
partially offsetting the cash generated by the reduction in real estate inventories were the net loss recorded in  and declines in accounts payable and accrued liabilities in as compared to our net cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in the increase in cash used in investing activities is attributable to million of cash deposited as collateral for outstanding letters of credit in partially offsetting this increase in restricted cash were proceeds of million received from the sale of a ownership interest in centennial 
in addition  our capital expenditures decreased from million in to million in our financing activities provided cash of million during compared to million during we paid million of fees and costs directly related to amendments to  and for the establishment of new  borrowing arrangements during compared to only  of such costs during we made payments of  on seller financed debt during compared to million of payments during net proceeds from our credit facility borrowings were million in compared to million in we also received million of cash related to the termination of our interest rate swap agreements during during  we generated million of cash flow from operations before net cash flows associated with real estate inventories 
net cash spent on real estate inventories was 
table of contents million  driven by net spending of million associated with increases in land and land development and other costs  as we added additional communities  offset by net cash received of million associated with the decrease in homes under construction 
we used million of net additional borrowings under our bank credit facility and cash from operations to finance the increase in real estate inventories 
real estate inventories the following table sets forth an estimate of our land inventory as of december   and includes a land that we own and b land that we control under option agreements and contingent contracts and that has already been zoned for our needs or which we otherwise believe is reasonably likely to result in a purchase 
the estimated number of lots is based on our current development plans  but the number of lots may change if our development plans change 
we generally do not purchase land for resale 
however  when land that we own no longer fits into our development plans  we offer this land for sale  primarily to other homebuilders and commercial developers 
land inventory finished lots lots under development unimproved land estimated lots estimated total number of lots inventory value land we own central ohio kentucky land we control central ohio kentucky held for sale central ohio kentucky total land inventory at december  total land inventory at december  lots on which inventory homes are being constructed are included in homes under construction in our consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the table above 
as of december   we had inventory homes  including in kentucky  in various stages of construction  representing an aggregate investment of million 
from a long term planning perspective  we attempt to maintain total land inventories that are sufficient to meet our anticipated lot needs for the next four to six years 
as of december   we owned lots or land that we estimate could be developed into approximately  lots  including  lots in kentucky 
as of that date  we also controlled  through option agreements or contingent contracts  land that we estimate could be developed into approximately additional lots  all of which are in ohio 
we hold additional contingent agreements for land that may allow us to develop additional lots that are not included in these totals 
however  based on our land review process  we have concluded that it is unlikely that all of the contingencies contained in these other agreements will be satisfied in the near future 
consequently  we did not consider these contingent agreements when estimating the total amount of land or number of lots that we control 
approximately  of deposits and  of pre acquisition and due 
table of contents diligence costs were recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  in connection with these contingent contracts 
the option agreements that we determined were more likely than not to have the contingencies satisfied expire at various dates through we decide whether to exercise any particular option or otherwise acquire additional land based upon our assessment of a number of factors  including our existing land inventory at the time  the status of purchase contingencies and our evaluation of the future demand for our homes 
our business strategy is to be the developer in substantially all of the communities in which we build homes 
the process of acquiring land  obtaining entitlements and developing communities is a multi year process and once we have begun the development of a new community  it is difficult and  at times  impractical to discontinue development activities 
as a result  in periods of declining sales and backlog  such as we have experienced during the past two years  our land inventory position may exceed our near term needs 
based on the  homes delivered during  our inventory of  lots as of december  represented an approximately year supply compared to our target range of a four to six year supply 
in contrast  during the preceding five years  from through  we sold  homes 
based on average annual sales during that five year period of  homes  our inventory of  lots as of december  would have represented a year supply 
as noted previously  our gross margin as a percent of revenues decreased to for compared to for the decline in gross margin is primarily the result of larger sales discounts  write offs of deposits and pre acquisition costs for land we decided not to purchase  impairment charges on communities and land held for sale  and gains and losses from the sale of land 
we provided sales incentives and special pricing promotions throughout in order to maintain market share and generate cash flow from the continued reduction of inventories 
we believe that these discounts are reflective of extremely competitive pricing in our markets and anticipate that gross margins will slowly begin to recover in future periods as the housing market recovers 
the reduced number of homes delivered and lower gross margins contributed to operating losses and deficits in operating cash flow during these factors have also required us to amend our credit facility and to obtain waivers during with respect to compliance with certain of its financial covenants 
in response to these concerns  we have significantly reduced selling  general and administrative expenses to align our cost structure with the current level of sales activity  slowed all land acquisition efforts  delayed the commencement of construction activities except where required for near term sales and have offered for sale various developed lots and land parcels that are not needed based on current absorption rates 
we completed million of land sales and recognized a gain of  during we completed million of land sales and recognized a gain of million during the gains relate to land sales where the net proceeds from the sale exceed the capitalized value of the land 
we review the recoverability of inventory carrying values quarterly and reduce the carrying value to fair value when cost is not expected to be recovered 
approximately million of the land sales and million of the land sales represent parcels previously written down to the estimated sales price on which no gain or loss was recognized at the time of sale 

table of contents land held for sale as of december  includes unimproved land and lots under development with an aggregate inventory value of million of our total land inventory and represents  lots of our total estimated lots 
the carrying value of land held for sale includes reserves of million that were recorded to reduce the carrying value of certain of the parcels to fair value 
approximately million of the land held for sale as of december  is subject to sales contracts 
these contracts generally contain due diligence requirements and other contingencies that allow the purchaser to cancel the contract  subject only to forfeiture of any non refundable deposits 
we evaluate the recoverability of our real estate inventories each quarter in accordance with sfas no 
our analysis includes factors such as the recent level of sales activity  estimated average selling prices  estimated sales  absorption rates  gross margin trends  projected cash flows and planned development activities for each community 
we record impairment charges  determined based on a discounted cash flow analysis  to reduce inventory carrying values to fair value in those instances where the cost is not expected to be recovered as a result of either the construction and delivery of a new home or the sale of the land parcel or lot 
during and  we recorded non cash charges to cost of real estate sold related to real estate inventory impairment charges and the write off of deposits and pre acquisition costs incurred for land that we decided not to purchase of million and million respectively 
of the various impairment charges previously recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of certain communities to their fair recoverable value  approximately million are included on the balance sheet at december  as a reduction in the basis of land and land development costs and homes under construction 
a discount rate of was applied to calculate the level of impairment charges recorded at december  real estate market prices for both developed and undeveloped lots are subject to a number of economic factors including new home demand  current selling prices for both new and existing homes  inventory levels in specific markets and interest rates 
further deterioration in either the demand for new homes in our markets or the gross margins that we are able to achieve from home sales may require additional inventory write downs in future periods

off balance sheet arrangements performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit 
we are often required to obtain performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit related to our obligations to various municipalities and other individuals with respect to the performance and completion of certain land development activities and as collateral for contingent land purchase commitments 
as of december   we had million and million of outstanding performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit  respectively 
the expiration dates of irrevocable letters of credit coincide with the expected completion dates of the related projects 
if the obligations related to a project are ongoing  annual extensions of the irrevocable letters of credit are typically granted 
performance bonds do not have stated expiration dates 
we are released from performance bonds when the contractual performance is completed 
in the event any of the performance bonds or irrevocable letters of credit are called  we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer of the performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit 
however  we do not believe that any currently outstanding performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit will be called 
the availability and cost of surety instruments is subject to the level of construction activity  our financial condition and other industry factors 
although at times we have experienced difficulty in obtaining performance bonds  we believe that we have sufficient capacity from insurers and under our letter of credit facility to satisfy the requirements of our development plans 

table of contents variable interest entities 
from time to time  we selectively enter into joint ventures with other homebuilders to own and develop communities 
through the creation of joint venture partnerships and limited liability companies  these joint ventures engage in land development activities for the purpose of distributing developed lots to the partners in the joint ventures 
the partners in the joint ventures acquire substantially all of the lots developed by the joint ventures and fund the development costs in proportion to their equity interests 
we receive our percentage interest in the lots developed in the form of capital distributions 
as of december   we had ownership interests in seven active joint ventures with ownership interests ranging from to 
these joint ventures generally do not incur debt  except for seller requested financing arrangements upon purchasing the land for the joint ventures 
we have determined that our land development joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities that would require consolidation in our financial statements 
see note  joint ventures  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herein 
in managing our land inventories  we enter into land option and contingent purchase contracts with third parties to acquire unimproved land and developed lots  which  depending on the circumstances  could qualify as variable interest entities under fin r 
these contracts may be with individual land owners or entities that hold land for sale and generally require us to pay or issue one or a combination of the following refundable deposits  non refundable deposits and letters of credit 
we have evaluated all of our land options and contingent purchase contracts and have concluded that  as of december   we did not have any outstanding contracts requiring consolidation as a result of the application of fin r 
cancelable contractual obligations consist of options under which we have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase land and contingent purchase contracts under which our obligation to purchase land is subject to the satisfaction of zoning  utility  environmental  title or other contingencies 
we continually evaluate our cancelable contractual obligations to purchase unimproved land and developed lots 
as of december   we had million of cancelable contractual obligations for which we had determined it is reasonably likely that we will complete the land or lot purchase 
we had not made any good faith deposits or incurred any related due diligence costs on these cancelable contractual obligations as of december  however   of performance bonds and irrevocable letters of credit were outstanding as collateral for these contingent land purchase commitments as of december  assuming that the contingencies are satisfied and that no other significant obstacles to development arise  we expect to purchase most of the residential lots and unimproved land that are subject to these cancelable contractual obligations within the next several years 
we expect to fund our land acquisition and development obligations from internally generated cash and from borrowings 
we are in the process of evaluating million of additional cancelable contractual obligations for which we have not yet determined whether it is reasonably likely that we will complete the land or lot purchase 
as of december   good faith deposits and related due diligence costs on these contracts were  good faith deposits and related due diligence costs are normally charged to earnings when we determine the purchase of the land or lots will not be completed 

table of contents we own a interest in alliance title agency  ltd 
alliance  a title insurance agency that provides closing services for our central ohio homes 
we determined that alliance is a variable interest entity and consolidated it with our other homebuilding operations effective january  as of december   our investment in alliance was  minority interest associated with alliance is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
the following is a summary of our commercial commitments under off balance sheet arrangements as of december  in thousands amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts committed less than year years years after years commercial commitments letters of credit performance bonds cancelable land contracts total commercial commitments inflation and other cost increases we are not always able to reflect all of our cost increases in the sales price of our homes because competitive pressures and other factors sometimes require us to maintain or discount our sales prices 
while we attempt to maintain material  labor and subcontractor costs from the date a sales contract with a customer is accepted until the date construction is completed  we may incur unanticipated costs which cannot be passed on to the customer 
for example  delays in construction of a home can cause the mortgage commitment to expire and can require us  if mortgage interest rates have increased  to pay significant amounts to the mortgage lender to extend the original mortgage interest rate 
in addition  during periods of high construction activities  we may incur additional costs to obtain subcontractors when certain trades are not readily available  which can result in lower gross profits 
periods of rapid price increases can result in lower gross profits

critical accounting policies the foregoing management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation is based upon our consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we 
table of contents evaluate our estimates  including those related to real estate inventories  warranty obligations  and construction costs for homes closed 
we base these estimates on historical trends and experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements reserves to reduce our real estate inventories to net realizable value are recorded using several factors  including  but not limited to  the recent level of sales activity  estimated average selling prices  estimated sales  absorption rates  gross margin trends  projected cash flows and planned development activities 
impairment charges are based upon a discounted cash flow analysis to reduce inventory carrying values to fair value in those instances where the cost is not expected to be recovered as a result of either the construction and delivery of a new home or through the sale of land parcel or lot 
the adequacy of our reserves could be materially affected by changes in market conditions 
estimates for remaining construction costs for homes closed are recorded in the period when the related home is closed 
these estimates are based on detailed budgets for each home  amounts spent to date and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs change  significant variances may be encountered 
reserves for the estimated cost of homes under warranty are recorded in the period in which the related home is closed and are based on historical experience and trends in actual warranty costs 
if actual warranty experience changes  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
estimates for the costs to complete land development are recorded upon completion of the related land development project 
estimates for land and land development costs are allocated to development phases based on the total number of lots expected to be developed within each community and are based on detailed budgets for the land development project and historical experience and trends 
if actual costs or the total number of lots developed changes  significant variances may be encountered 
estimates for capitalized overhead and interest costs are recorded in real estate inventories for interim financial reporting purposes and then adjusted to actual results at year end 
annualized capitalization rates for indirect overhead and interest are determined by estimating the total current year projected development costs  indirect construction costs  interest  closings and ending inventory 
if actual costs  closings or inventory levels change  significant variances to the estimated quarterly capitalization rates results may be encountered 
to minimize this risk  management closely monitors the estimated to actual results on a quarterly basis 
self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with workers compensation and medical benefits 
these accruals include estimates that are based on assumptions about historical loss development factors and actual benefit costs 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual materially different from the calculated amounts 

table of contents we record income tax liabilities utilizing known obligations and estimates of potential obligations 
a deferred tax asset or liability is recognized whenever there are future tax effects from existing temporary differences and tax credit carry forwards 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the balance that is more likely than not to be realized 
we use an estimate of the annual effective tax rate at each interim period based on the facts and circumstances available at that time  while the actual effective tax rate is calculated at year end 
if circumstances change  our estimated annual effective tax rate could change  creating variances in quarterly results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a number of market risks in the ordinary course of business 
our primary market risk exposure relates to fluctuations in interest rates on borrowings under our credit facility  which permits borrowings up to million  subject to limitations on availability 
under the credit facility  interest on our revolving line of credit and term a notes is variable and calculated  at our option  based on either libor plus or the prime rate plus 
as of december   our revolving line of credit and term a notes bear interest at a rate of  which was determined using the libor option 
the following table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates for our borrowings outstanding as of december  expected maturity date total liabilities variable rate average interest rate fixed rate average interest rate does not include impact of amortization of debt discount and debt issuance costs 
at times we have managed a portion of our market risk related to interest rate fluctuations through interest rate swap contracts 
as of december   we were a party to interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million that effectively fixed the interest rate for a portion of the variable rate borrowings under our line of credit 
in october  we closed all of the outstanding positions in our interest rate swap contracts 
the table below presents information relating to our outstanding borrowings and interest rate swap contracts held as of december  for the outstanding borrowings  the table presents principal cash flows and the related weighted average interest rate by expected maturity date
