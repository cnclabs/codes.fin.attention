discontinued operations include the results from our collectible trading card business and die cast sports collectibles product line  which were disposed of in connection with the sale of rc south  inc effective november  item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading designer  producer and marketer of innovative  high quality toys  collectibles  and infant products that are targeted to consumers of all ages 
we reach our target consumers through multiple channels of distribution supporting more than  retail outlets throughout north america  europe  australia and asia pacific 
our product categories include i infant and toddler products  ii preschool products and iii youth and adult products 
we market a significant portion of our products with licenses from other parties  and we are currently a party to over license agreements  approximately of which are actively used in our current product lines 
sales 
our sales are primarily derived from the sale of infant and toddler products  preschool products and youth and adult products and are recognized upon transfer of title of product to our customers 
we market our products through a variety of distribution channels  including chain retailers  specialty retailers  wholesalers and oem dealers  and corporate promotional  direct to consumer and other 
for the years ended december   and  sales to chain retailers comprised  and  respectively  of our net sales 
our products are marketed and distributed in north america  europe  australia and asia pacific 
international sales  defined as sales outside of north america  constituted  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect international sales to increase over the next several years as we expand our geographic reach 
our net sales have not been materially impacted by foreign currency fluctuations 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from some of the world s largest retailers 
our top five customers accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
wal mart  our largest customer accounted for and of our net sales in and  respectively 
toys r us babies r us accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
target accounted for and of our net sales in and  respectively 
in  other than toys r us babies r us  no customer accounted for more than of our net sales 
other than toys r us babies r us  wal mart and target  no customer accounted for more than of our net sales in or we provide certain customers the option to take delivery of our products in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada  belgium or germany with credit terms generally ranging from to days or directly in china with payment made by irrevocable letter of credit or wire transfer 
we generally grant price discounts on direct sales from china resulting in lower gross margins 
however  shipments direct from china lower our distribution and administrative costs  so we believe that our operating income margin is comparable for products delivered in china versus products shipped in the united states  united kingdom  australia  canada  belgium or germany 
for the years ended december   and  direct sales from china constituted  and  respectively  of our net sales 
we do not ordinarily sell our products on consignment  and we ordinarily accept returns only for defective merchandise 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from us  we may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling such excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions  which are typically evaluated and issued annually 
returns and allowances on an annual basis have ranged from to of our net sales over the last three years 
expenses 
our products are manufactured by third parties  principally located in china 
cost of sales primarily consists of purchases of finished products  which accounted for  and of our cost of sales in  and  respectively 
the remainder of our cost of sales primarily includes tooling depreciation  freight in from suppliers  concept and design expenses  employee compensation and expense related to stock based payment arrangements 
substantially all of our purchases of finished products from the far east are denominated in hong kong dollars  and therefore  subject to currency fluctuations 
historically  we have not incurred substantial exposure due to currency fluctuations because since the hong kong government has maintained a policy of linking the hong kong dollar and the us dollar 
a future increase in the value of the hong kong dollar relative to the us dollar may increase our cost of sales and decrease our gross margins 
additionally  if our suppliers experience increased raw materials  labor or other costs and pass along such cost increases to us through higher prices for finished goods  our cost of sales would increase  and to the extent we are unable to pass such price increases along to our customers  our gross margins would decrease 
for example  increases in the price of zinc  a key component in die cast products  and increased costs in china  primarily for labor  reduced our gross margins in and may continue to reduce our gross margins in our quarterly gross margins can also be affected by the mix of product that is shipped during each quarter 
our infant and toddler products category has higher sales of non licensed products that carry lower selling prices and gross margins than our preschool products and youth and adult products categories 
additionally  individual product lines within each category carry gross margins that vary significantly and cause quarterly fluctuations  based on the timing of these individual shipments throughout the year 
selling  general and administrative expenses primarily consist of royalties  employee compensation  advertising and marketing expenses  freight out to customers  sales commissions and expense related to stock based payment arrangements 
royalties vary by product category and are generally paid on a quarterly basis 
multiple royalties may be paid to various licensors on a single product 
in  aggregate royalties by product ranged from approximately to of our net sales price 
royalty expense was approximately  and of our net sales for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we signed two new license agreements with hit entertainment with respect to certain thomas friends product lines 
based on the new agreements  we expect our total pre tax licensing cost  net of expected price increases and margin improvements  for these thomas friends licenses will increase by approximately million in when compared to sales commissions ranged from approximately to of the net sales price and are generally paid quarterly to our external sales representative organizations

net cash provided by financing activities in was million 
in  we made payments of million on our term loans 
during  we borrowed a total of million and made total payments of million on our lines of credit 
at december   we had million available on our domestic line of credit 
historically  we have used a significant portion of excess cash to pay down debt 
upon the closing of the acquisition of tfy on september   the company entered into a new credit facility  which has subsequently been amended  to replace its previous credit facility 
the credit facility is comprised of an million term loan and a million revolving line of credit 
the credit facility also provides an additional million of capacity under the revolving line of credit 
this additional capacity is currently uncommitted by the lenders and must be approved by the lenders upon the company s request for borrowing 
principal payments ranging from million to million on the term loan are scheduled quarterly beginning december  and continue thereafter until december  the revolving line of credit is available until its maturity on september  a portion of the term loan has an interest rate of plus applicable margin through the first three years of the facility 
the remaining term loan and revolving line of credit bear interest  at the company s option  at a base rate or at a libor rate plus applicable margin 
the applicable margin is based on the company s ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and non cash expense related to equity awards and varies between and 
at december   the margin in effect was for libor loans 
the company is also required to pay a commitment fee of to per annum on the average daily unused portion of the revolving line of credit 
at december   the commitment fee in effect was per annum 
under the terms of this credit facility  the company is required to comply with certain financial and non financial covenants 
among other restrictions  the company is restricted in its ability to pay dividends  incur additional debt and make acquisitions above certain amounts 
the key financial covenants include minimum ebitda and interest coverage and leverage ratios 
the credit facility is secured by working capital assets and certain intangible assets 
on december   the company had million outstanding on the term loan and no amounts outstanding on the revolving line of credit and was in compliance with all covenants 
in august  the company completed a public offering of  shares of common stock  and certain selling stockholders sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
the company received proceeds of million from the offering  net of underwriting discount  and used million of the proceeds to repay outstanding debt 
the company s hong kong subsidiary maintains an on going credit agreement with a bank that provides for a line of credit of up to million 
amounts borrowed under this line of credit bear interest at the bank s prime rate or prevailing funding cost  whichever is higher  and are cross guaranteed by the company 
as of december  and  there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit 
the company s united kingdom subsidiary maintains a line of credit with a bank for million that expires on july  the line of credit bears interest at over the bank s base rate  and the total amount is subject to a letter of guarantee given by the company 
at december  and  there were no amounts outstanding on this line of credit 
during  the company s united kingdom subsidiary entered into an additional line of credit with a bank for million that was to expire on september  the line of credit bore interest at over the libor rate  and the total amount was secured by a guarantee of the company

the following table summarizes our significant contractual commitments at december  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total and beyond long term debt including current portion estimated future interest payments on long term debt minimum guaranteed royalty payments operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations estimated future interest payments on long term debt were based upon the interest rates in effect at december  on february   we announced that our board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase up to million in shares of our common stock 
the program has initially been authorized for a period of one year  but may be extended beyond that period or may be suspended at any time 
repurchases may occur from time to time and are expected be funded by cash flow from operations 
we believe that our cash flows from operations  cash on hand and available borrowings will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet anticipated operating needs in due to seasonal increases in demand for our products  our working capital is typically highest during the third and fourth quarters and our debt levels are the highest during the second and third quarters 
although operating activities are expected to provide sufficient cash  any significant future product or property acquisitions  including up front licensing payments  may require additional debt or equity financing 
off balance sheet arrangements the company did not have any off balance sheet arrangements during any of the years ended december   and critical accounting policies and estimates the company makes certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
the accounting policies described below are those the company considers critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
these policies include significant estimates made by management using information available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents adjustments to customer trade accounts receivable for amounts deemed uncollectible 
the allowance for doubtful accounts reduces gross trade receivables to their estimated net realizable value and is disclosed on the face of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
the company s allowance is based on management s assessment of the business environment  customers financial condition  historical trends  customer payment practices  receivable aging and customer disputes 
the company has purchased credit insurance that covers a portion of its receivables from major customers 
the company will continue to proactively review its credit risks and adjust its customer terms to reflect the current environment 
inventory 
inventory  which consists of finished goods  has been written down for excess quantities and obsolescence  and is stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method and includes all costs necessary to bring inventory to its existing condition and location 
market represents the lower of replacement cost or estimated net realizable value 
inventory write downs are recorded for damaged  obsolete  excess and slow moving inventory 
the company s management uses estimates to record these write downs based on its review of inventory by product category  length of time on hand and order bookings 
changes in public and consumer preferences and demand for product or changes in customer buying patterns and inventory management  as well as discontinuance of products or product lines  could impact the inventory valuation 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
long lived assets have been reviewed for impairment based on sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
this statement requires that an impairment loss be recognized whenever the carrying value of an asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset  excluding future interest costs the entity would recognize as an expense when incurred 
goodwill and other intangible assets have been reviewed for impairment based on sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this statement  goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but rather tested at least annually for impairment 
the company s management reviews for indicators that might suggest an impairment loss could exist 
testing for impairment requires estimates of expected cash flows to be generated from the use of the assets 
various uncertainties  including changes in consumer preferences  deterioration in the political environment or changes in general economic conditions  could impact the expected cash flows to be generated by an asset or group of assets 
intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over their useful lives 
the company adopted sfas no 
on january  goodwill had been amortized over years on a straight line basis through december  approximately million of this goodwill is tax deductible over years 
as of december  and  goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  was million and million  respectively 
the decrease in goodwill at december   was due to the completion of the sale of the rc south  inc business 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment tests as of october  and which resulted in no impairment 
the annual impairment tests for intangible assets in resulted in no impairment to intangibles 
however  for the year ended december   an impairment charge for intangible assets in the north america segment of million has been included in the restructuring charge related to discontinued automotive collectibles within operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings  as a result of the annual impairment test for intangible assets 
the impairment charge was based upon the company s decision to discontinue its automotive collectible product lines 
income taxes 
the company records current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities 
management considers all available evidence in evaluating the realizability of the deferred tax assets and records valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets as needed 
management believes it is more likely than not that the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the appropriate carry forward periods to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets except for those deferred tax assets for which an allowance has been provided 
in determining the required liability  management considers certain tax exposures and all available evidence 
however  if the available evidence were to change in the future  an adjustment to the tax related balances may be required 
estimates for such tax contingencies are classified in other non current liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
accrued allowances 
the company ordinarily accepts returns only for defective merchandise 
in certain instances  where retailers are unable to resell the quantity of products that they have purchased from the company  the company  may  in accordance with industry practice  assist retailers in selling excess inventory by offering credits and other price concessions  which are typically evaluated and issued annually 
other allowances can also be issued for defective merchandise  volume programs and co op advertising 
all allowances are accrued throughout the year  as sales are recorded 
the allowances are based on the terms of the various programs in effect  however  management also takes into consideration historical trends and specific customer and product information when making its estimates 
for the volume programs  the company generally sets a volume target for the year with each participating customer and issues the discount if the target is achieved 
the allowance for the volume program is accrued throughout the year  and if it becomes clear to management that the target for the participating customer will not be reached  the company will change the estimate for that customer as required 
the company s products currently carry a limited warranty which guarantees the product to be free from defects in material and workmanship under normal and intended use for a period of days from the date of consumer purchase 
historical results of product warranty claims have shown that they have had an immaterial impact on the company 
based upon the historical results  appropriate allowances for product warranty claims are accrued throughout the year 
accrued royalties 
royalties are accrued based on the provisions in licensing agreements for amounts due on net sales during the period  as well as management estimates for additional royalty exposures 
royalties vary by product category and are generally paid on a quarterly basis 
multiple royalties may be paid to various licensors on a single product 
royalty expense is included in selling  general and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
stock based compensation 
on january   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payments 
the company elected to use the modified prospective application of sfas no 
r for awards issued prior to january  income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended december  includes total expense recognized for stock based payment plans 
the fair value of stock options granted under the stock incentive plans is estimated on the date of grant based on the black scholes option pricing model 
the company calculates the expected volatility factor for those options issued under the stock incentive plan to correspond with the average volatility factor of those companies included in a peer group study 
the historical stock price movements of the company s common stock have not been considered a good indicator of expected future volatility because the company s business has changed significantly as a result of acquisitions completed 
however  the company continues to monitor its actual volatility to assess whether its historical stock price movements over the expected option term are a good indicator of expected future results 
the company uses historical data to estimate share option exercise and employee departure behavior used in the black scholes option pricing model 
the expected term of share options granted represents the period of time that share options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for the period within the contractual term of the share option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no

 accounting for income taxes 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement approach for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently assessing the impact that this interpretation will have on the company s financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement 
however  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for the financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the company is evaluating the effect that this statement will have on the company s financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk associated with the company s credit facilities and foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with the company s foreign operations 
based on the company s interest rate exposure on variable rate borrowings at december   a one percentage point increase in average interest rates on the company s borrowings would increase future interest expense by  per month and a five percentage point increase would increase future interest expense by approximately  per month 
the company determined these amounts based on approximately million of variable rate borrowings at december   multiplied by and  respectively  and divided by twelve 
the company is currently not using any interest rate collars  hedges or other derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce interest rate risk 
as a result  any increase in interest rates on the company s variable rate borrowings would increase interest expense and reduce net income 
the company s net sales are primarily denominated in us dollars  with of net sales in denominated in british pounds sterling  australian dollars  euros and canadian dollars 
the company s purchases of finished goods from chinese manufacturers are primarily denominated in hong kong dollars 
expenses for these manufacturers are primarily denominated in chinese renminbi 
the hong kong dollar is currently pegged to the us dollar 
if the hong kong dollar ceased to be pegged to the us dollar  a material increase in the value of the hong kong dollar relative to the us dollar would increase our expenses and  therefore  could adversely affect our profitability 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the hong kong dollar for the year ended december   would have changed the total dollar amount of our gross profit by 
during july  china revalued the chinese renminbi  abandoning the former method of pegging the chinese renminbi to the us dollar 
as expenses for the company s chinese manufacturers are primarily denominated in chinese renminbi  a material increase in the value of the chinese renminbi relative to the us dollar would increase the company s expenses and  therefore  could adversely affect the company s profitability 
a change in the exchange rate of the us dollar with respect to the british pound sterling  the australian dollar  the euro or the canadian dollar for the year ended december   would not have had a significant impact on the company s earnings 
the company is also subject to exchange rate risk relating to transfers of funds denominated in british pounds sterling  australian dollars  canadian dollars or euros from its foreign subsidiaries to the united sates 
historically  the company has not used hedges or other derivative financial instruments to manage or reduce exchange rate risk
