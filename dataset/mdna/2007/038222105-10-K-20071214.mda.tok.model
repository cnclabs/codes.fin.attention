applied s customers include manufacturers of semiconductor chips and wafers  liquid crystal displays lcds  solar photovoltaic pv cells  flexible electronics and energy efficient glass 
applied reports four segments silicon  fab solutions  display  and adjacent technologies 
product development and manufacturing activities occur in north america  europe  israel and asia 
applied s broad range of equipment and service products are highly technical and are sold through a direct sales force 
as a supplier to these industries  applied s results are driven primarily by worldwide demand for integrated circuits  which in turn depends on end user demand for electronic products 
applied s business is subject to cyclical industry conditions  as demand for manufacturing equipment and services can change depending on supply and demand for chips  lcds and other electronic devices  as well as other factors  such as global economic conditions and technological advances in fabrication processes 
the following table presents certain significant measurements for the past three fiscal years fiscal year in millions  except per share amounts and percentages new orders net sales gross margin gross margin percent net income earnings per share fiscal financial results reflected improved conditions in the semiconductor industry that began with the industry s recovery in  while conditions in the display industry were mixed as manufacturers postponed capacity additions despite strong consumer demand for lcd tvs 
total orders decreased slightly from fiscal  primarily due to the significant decline in demand for display manufacturing products  partially offset by increased demand for products and services in all other segments 
net sales increased during fiscal over fiscal  primarily due to strong demand from dram and flash memory chip manufacturers  partially offset by a significant decline in lcd equipment sales as manufacturers absorbed capacity following substantial growth in net income improved in fiscal compared to fiscal due to higher sales and lower operating expenses  offset in 
table of contents part by lower interest income 
fiscal financial results included equity based compensation expenses  restructuring and asset impairment and other charges associated with ceasing development of beamline implant products  and an in process research and development ipr d expense associated with the acquisition of certain net assets of brooks automation  inc brooks software 
in fiscal  customer demand improved over fiscal  resulting in higher orders and revenue 
fiscal results reflected a recovery in the semiconductor and flat panel display industries and the global economy  as end user demand for electronic products and lcds drove increased customer investments in advanced silicon particularly memory and display products

cash dividends totaling million were paid during fiscal applied currently anticipates that cash dividends will continue to be paid on a quarterly basis in the future  although the declaration of any future cash dividend is at the discretion of the board of directors and will depend on applied s financial condition  results of operations  capital requirements  business conditions and other factors  as well as a determination that cash dividends are in the best interests of applied stockholders 
financing activities also included borrowings and repayments of debt 
applied did not have any borrowings in fiscal years  or as of october   applied had credit facilities for unsecured borrowings in various currencies of up to approximately billion  of which billion is comprised of a year revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that is scheduled to expire in january this agreement provides for borrowings at interest rates keyed to one of the two rates selected by applied for each advance  and includes financial and other covenants with which applied was in compliance at october  no amounts were outstanding under this agreement at october  cash used for debt repayments totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal cash generated from issuances of common stock pursuant to applied s equity compensation programs totaled million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal on september   applied entered into accelerated stock buyback agreements with goldman sachs under which applied agreed to repurchase from goldman sachs shares of applied s outstanding common stock for an initial purchase price of billion 
under the agreements  applied purchased million shares of its common stock on september  at a price per share of  and goldman sachs agreed to purchase an equivalent number of shares in the open market over the following four months 
at the end of the four month period  applied was entitled or subject to a price adjustment based upon the volume weighted average price of applied common stock during the purchase period 
on january   applied settled the price adjustment of million by payment in cash to goldman sachs  resulting in an adjusted price per share of 
the repurchase was funded with applied s existing cash and investments 
the repurchased shares were reported as treasury stock 
at october   cash and cash equivalents included an aggregate investment of million in an enhanced cash fund the fund 
during the period between october  and december   applied redeemed net million of its investment in the fund at par value net of interim transactions 
on december   the fund s manager notified applied that cash redemptions were temporarily suspended  although redemptions could be fulfilled through a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities  consisting principally of high quality corporate debt  mortgage backed securities and asset backed securities  the fund s valuation will be based on the market value of the underlying securities  whereas historically the fund s valuation was based on amortized cost  and interest would continue to accrue 
the estimated carrying value of applied s investment in the fund at december  was million and is not considered a cash equivalent due to the suspension of fund redemptions 
applied expects to receive a pro rata distribution of the underlying securities in the fund 
applied anticipates that this redemption will not result in a significant loss 
the securities received on redemption will be subject to changes in value depending on market conditions 
although cash requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of factors such as those discussed above  applied s management believes that cash generated from operations  together with the liquidity provided by existing cash balances and borrowing capability  will be sufficient to satisfy applied s liquidity requirements for the next months 
for further details regarding applied s operating  investing and financing activities for each of the three years in the period ended october   see the consolidated statements of cash flows in this report 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  applied provides standby letters of credit or other guarantee instruments to third parties as required for certain transactions initiated either by applied or its subsidiaries 
as of october   the maximum potential amount of future payments that applied could be required to make under these guarantee agreements was approximately million 
applied has not recorded any liability in connection with these guarantee arrangements below that required applied to appropriately account for the underlying transaction being guaranteed 
applied does not believe  based on historical experience and information currently available  that it is probable that any amounts will be required to be paid under these guarantee arrangements 
applied also has operating leases for various facilities 
total rental expense for operating leases was million for fiscal  million for fiscal  and million for fiscal contractual obligations the following table summarizes applied s contractual obligations as of october  payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years in millions long term debt obligations interest expense associated with long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities represents applied s agreements to purchase goods and services consisting of applied s a outstanding purchase orders for goods and services  and b contractual requirements to make specified minimum payments even if applied does not take delivery of the contracted goods 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of applied s consolidated financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
specifically  these policies have the following attributes applied is required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and different estimates applied could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on applied s financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
applied bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as applied s operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
in addition  management is periodically faced with uncertainties  the outcomes of which are not within its control and will not be known for prolonged periods of time 
these uncertainties are discussed in the section above entitled risk factors 
based on a critical assessment of its accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the 
table of contents application of those policies  management believes that applied s consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and provide a meaningful presentation of applied s financial condition and results of operations 
management believes that the following are critical accounting policies warranty costs applied provides for the estimated cost of warranty when revenue is recognized 
estimated warranty costs are determined by analyzing specific product and historical configuration statistics and regional warranty support costs 
applied s warranty obligation is affected by product and component failure rates  material usage and labor costs incurred in correcting product failures during the warranty period 
as applied s customer engineers and process support engineers are highly trained and deployed globally  labor availability is a significant factor in determining labor costs 
the quantity and availability of critical replacement parts is another significant factor in estimating warranty costs 
unforeseen component failures or exceptional component performance can also result in changes to warranty costs 
if actual warranty costs differ substantially from applied s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
inventory valuation inventories are generally stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on a first in  first out basis 
the carrying value of inventory is reduced for estimated obsolescence by the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand 
applied evaluates the inventory carrying value for potential excess and obsolete inventory exposures by analyzing historical and anticipated demand 
in addition  inventories are evaluated for potential obsolescence due to the effect of known and anticipated engineering change orders and new products 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than estimated  additional inventory adjustments for excess or obsolete inventory might be required  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and intangible assets applied reviews goodwill and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable  and also reviews goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives annually for impairment 
intangible assets  such as purchased technology  are generally recorded in connection with a business acquisition 
the value assigned to intangible assets is usually based on estimates and judgments regarding expectations for the success and life cycle of products and technology acquired 
if actual product acceptance differs significantly from the estimates  applied may be required to record an impairment charge to write down the asset to its realizable value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is estimated using the market multiples approach  and is dependent on market values for companies in a similar industry 
a severe decline in market value could result in an unexpected impairment charge for impaired goodwill  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
income taxes applied accounts for income taxes by recognizing deferred tax assets and liabilities using statutory tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities  net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are also reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
management has determined that it is more likely than not that its future taxable income will be sufficient to realize its deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate is highly dependent upon the geographic composition of worldwide earnings  tax regulations governing each region  non tax deductible expenses incurred in connection with acquisitions and availability of tax credits 
management carefully monitors the changes in many factors and adjusts the effective income tax rate as required 
if actual results differ from these estimates  applied could be required to record a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets or adjust its effective income tax rate  which could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with applied s expectations could have a material impact on applied s results of operations and financial condition 
legal matters applied is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  that arise in the ordinary course of business 
applied evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and reasonably estimates the amount of the loss 
significant judgment is required in both the probability determination and as to whether an exposure can be reasonably estimated 
when applied determines that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable  the effect is recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
although the outcome of these claims cannot be predicted with certainty  applied does not believe that any of the existing legal matters will have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
however  significant changes in legal proceedings and claims  or the factors considered in the evaluation of those matters  could have a material adverse effect on applied s business  financial condition and results of operations 
equity based compensation employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plans beginning on october   applied began accounting for stock options and employee stock purchase plan espp shares under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires recognition of the fair value of equity based compensation 
the fair value of stock options and espp shares was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this methodology requires the use of subjective assumptions in implementing sfas r  including expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award 
the fair value of equity based compensation awards less the estimated forfeitures is amortized over the service period of the award  and applied has elected to use the straight line method 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  applied accounted for stock options and espp shares under the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
pro forma net income and pro forma net income per share disclosed in the footnotes to the consolidated financial statements were estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
the fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair market value of applied s common stock at the date of grant see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk at october   applied s investment portfolio included fixed income securities with a fair value of approximately billion 
applied s primary objective for investing in fixed income securities is to preserve principal while maximizing returns and minimizing risk 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase 
based on applied s investment portfolio at october  and october   an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of the portfolio of approximately million and million  respectively 
while an increase in interest rates reduces the fair value of the investment portfolio  applied will not realize the losses in the consolidated statement of operations unless the individual fixed income securities are sold prior to recovery or the loss is determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
all of applied s debt bears interest at fixed rates 
therefore  an immediate basis point increase in interest rates would not be expected to have a material effect on applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk certain operations of applied are conducted in foreign currencies  such as japanese yen  euro  israeli shekel and swiss francs 
applied enters into forward exchange and currency option contracts to hedge a portion of  but not all  existing and anticipated foreign currency denominated transactions expected to occur typically within 
table of contents months 
gains and losses on these contracts are generally recognized in the consolidated statements of operations at the time that the related transactions being hedged are recognized 
because the effect of movements in currency exchange rates on forward exchange and currency option contracts generally offsets the related effect on the underlying items being hedged  these financial instruments are not expected to subject applied to risks that would otherwise result from changes in currency exchange rates 
applied does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
net foreign currency gains and losses did not have a material effect on applied s results of operations for fiscal  or forward exchange contracts are denominated in the same currency as the underlying transactions primarily japanese yen  euro  israeli shekel and swiss francs  and the terms of the forward exchange contracts generally match the terms of the underlying transactions 
applied s outstanding forward exchange contracts are marked to market see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  as are the majority of the related underlying transactions being hedged  therefore  the effect of exchange rate changes on forward exchange contracts is expected to be substantially offset by the effect of these changes on the underlying transactions 
the effect of an immediate percent change in exchange rates on forward exchange contracts and the underlying hedged transactions is not expected to be material to applied s near term financial condition or results of operations 
applied s risk with respect to currency option contracts is limited to the premium paid for the right to exercise the option 
premiums paid for options outstanding at october  were not material
