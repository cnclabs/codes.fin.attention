table of contents unregistered sales of equity securities as noted elsewhere in this form k during the relevant period the period from may  through september  our registration statements on form s were not available to cover offers and sales of our securities to employees and other persons because our financial statements were not current 
as a result  the acquisition of units of interest units representing a total of  shares of our common stock by our k plan on behalf of participants in our k plan during the relevant period did not comply with the registration requirements of the securities act 
our failure to maintain the effectiveness of our registration statement on form s gave the participants who directed the k plan to purchase units during the relevant period the right to rescind these purchases or recover damages if they had sold their units for up to one year under federal law following the purchase of these units 
in order to address this compliance issue  as explained elsewhere in this form k we conducted a rescission offering that expired on january  pursuant to which we made certain payments to accepting participants 
it is unclear  however  whether or not participants in our k plan continue to have any rescission rights under the federal securities laws following the expiration of the rescission offering 
it is the view of the sec staff that a right of rescission created under the securities act may survive a rescission offer 
however  federal courts in the past have ruled that a person who rejects or fails to accept a rescission offer is precluded from later seeking similar relief 
the remedies and statute of limitations under state securities laws vary and depend upon the state in which the shares were purchased 
we believe  however  that the acquisitions of units made on behalf of participants during the relevant period were exempt from state registration requirements 
based on our current stock price  we believe that our current potential liability for rescission claims is not material to our financial condition or results of operations  however  our potential liability could become material in the future if our stock price were to fall below participants acquisition prices for their interest in our stock fund during the one year period following the unregistered acquisitions and if it were determined by competent legal authorities that our rescission offering did not effectively terminate the rights of participants to seek rescission 
during  we issued an aggregate of  shares of restricted stock to employees pursuant to the stock compensation plan 
we believe these securities are not subject to registration under the no sale principle or were otherwise issued pursuant to exemptions from registration under section of the securities act as transactions by an issuer not involving a public offering

executive overview we are an established leader in the fluid motion and control business  with a strong portfolio of pumping systems  valves  sealing solutions  automation and services in support of the oil and gas  chemical  power generation  water treatment and general industrial markets 
these products are integral to the movement  control and protection of fluids in customers critical processes  whether it is a refinery  a power generation facility or a transportation pipeline 
our business model is heavily influenced by the capital spending of these industries for the placement of new products into service and for maintenance on existing facilities 
the worldwide installed base of our products is another important source of revenue  where products are expected to ensure the maximum operating time of many key industrial processes 
the aftermarket business includes parts  service solutions  product life cycle solutions and other value added services  and is generally a higher margin business and a key component to our profitable growth 
we have experienced favorable conditions in in several of our core markets  specifically oil and gas 
the rise of the price of crude oil and natural gas  in particular  has spurred capital investment in the oil and gas market  resulting in many new projects and expansion opportunities 
favorable market conditions have resulted in corresponding growth  much of which is in non traditional areas of the world where new oil and gas reserves have been discovered 
we believe the outlook for our business remains favorable  however  we believe that oil and gas prices will fluctuate in the future and such volatility could have a negative impact on our business in some or all of the geographical areas in which we conduct business 
we and our customers are seeing rapid growth in the middle east and asia  with china providing a significant source of project growth 
we continue to execute on our strategy to increase our presence in all of these regions to capture aftermarket business through the current installed base  as well as new projects and process plant expansions 
the opportunity to increase the installed base of new products and drive recurring aftermarket business in future years is a critical by product of these favorable market 
table of contents conditions 
although we have experienced strong demand for our products and services in recent periods  we face challenges affecting many companies in our industry and or with significant international operations 
we currently employ approximately  employees in more than countries who are focused on six key strategies that reach across the business 
see our strategies section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a for a discussion of our six key strategies 
we continue to build on our geographic breadth with the implementation of additional quick response centers qrcs with the goal to be positioned as near to the customers as possible for service and support in order to capture this important aftermarket business 
along with ensuring that we have the local capability to sell  install and service our equipment in remote regions  it becomes equally imperative to continuously improve our global operations 
our global supply chain capability is being expanded to meet global customer demands and ensure the quality and timely delivery of our products 
significant efforts are underway to reduce the supply base and drive processes across the divisions to find areas of synergy and cost reduction 
in addition  we are improving our supply chain management capability to ensure it can meet global customer demands 
we continue to focus on improving on time delivery and quality  while reducing warranty costs across our global operations through a focused continuous improvement process cip initiative 
the goal of the cip initiative is to maximize service fulfillment to customers such as on time delivery  reduced cycle time and quality at the highest internal productivity 
this program is a key factor in our margin expansion plans 
recent developments legal and regulatory matters on february   we received a subpoena from the sec seeking documents and information relating primarily to products that two of our foreign subsidiaries delivered to iraq from through under the united nations oil for food program 
we believe that the sec s investigation is focused primarily on whether any inappropriate payments were made to iraqi officials in violation of the federal securities laws 
the investigation includes periods prior to  as well as subsequent to  our acquisition of the foreign operations involved in the investigation 
we may be subject to certain liabilities if violations are found regardless of whether they relate to periods before or subsequent to our acquisition 
in addition  the two foreign subsidiaries have been contacted by governmental authorities in their respective countries concerning their involvement in the united nations oil for food program 
we are unable to predict how the foreign governmental authorities will pursue either of these matters in the future 
we believe that the sec and the foreign governmental authorities are also investigating other companies in connection with the united nations oil for food program 
we engaged outside counsel in february to conduct an investigation of our foreign subsidiaries participation in the united nations oil for food program 
the audit committee of the board of directors has been regularly monitoring this situation since the receipt of the sec subpoena and assumed direct oversight of the investigation in january we currently expect the investigation will be completed during the second quarter of our investigation has included  among other things  a detailed review of contracts with the iraqi government under the united nations oil for food program during through  a forensic review of the accounting records associated with these contracts  and interviews of persons with knowledge of the events in question 
our investigation has found evidence to date that  during the years through  certain non us personnel at the two foreign subsidiaries authorized payments in connection with certain of our product sales under the united nations oil for food program totaling approximately million  which were subsequently deposited by a third party into iraqi controlled bank accounts 
these payments were not authorized under the united nations oil for food program and were not properly documented in the subsidiaries accounting records but were expensed as paid 
during the course of the investigation  certain other potential issues involving non us personnel were identified at one of the foreign subsidiaries  which are currently under review 
we have taken certain disciplinary actions against persons who engaged in wrongful conduct  violated our ethics policies or failed to cooperate fully in the investigation  including terminating the employment of certain 
table of contents non us senior management personnel at one of the foreign subsidiaries 
certain other non us senior management personnel at that facility involved in the above conduct had been previously separated from our company for other reasons 
we will continue to fully cooperate in both the sec and the foreign investigations 
the investigations are in progress but  at this point  are incomplete 
accordingly  if the sec and or the foreign authorities take enforcement action with regard to these investigations  we may be required to pay fines  disgorge profits  consent to injunctions against future conduct or suffer other penalties which could potentially materially impact our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
in march  we initiated a process to determine our compliance posture with respect to us export control laws and regulations 
upon initial investigation  it appeared that some product transactions and technology transfers were not necessarily in full compliance with us export control laws and regulations 
as a result  in conjunction with outside counsel  we are currently involved in a systematic process to conduct further review  validation  and voluntary disclosure of certain apparent export violations discovered as part of this review process 
we currently believe this process will not be substantially complete until the first quarter of  given the complexity of the export laws and the current scope of the investigation 
any violations of us export control laws and regulations that are identified and disclosed to the us government may result in civil or criminal penalties  including fines and or other penalties 
because our review into this issue is ongoing  we are currently unable to determine the full extent of any confirmed violations or determine the nature or total amount of potential penalties to which we might be subject to in the future 
given that the resolution of this matter is uncertain at this time  we are not able to reasonably estimate the maximum amount of liability that could result from final resolution of this matter 
we cannot currently predict whether the ultimate resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our business  including our ability to do business outside the us  or on our financial condition 
other matters on september   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to two million shares of our outstanding common stock 
shares may be repurchased to offset potentially dilutive effects of stock options issued under our equity based compensation programs 
we commenced the program in october and repurchased million shares for million during the fourth quarter of subsequent repurchases as of february  have totaled million shares for million 
we expect to conclude the program by the end of the second quarter of business overview our company we believe that we are a world leading manufacturer and aftermarket service provider of comprehensive flow control systems 
we develop and manufacture precision engineered flow control equipment such as pumps  valves and seals  for critical service applications that require high reliability 
we use our manufacturing platform to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services such as installation  advanced diagnostics  repair and retrofitting 
operations are conducted through three business segments that are referenced throughout this document flowserve pump division fpd engineered pumps  industrial pumps and related services  flow control division fcd industrial valves  manual valves  control valves  nuclear valves  valve actuators and controls and related services  and flow solutions division fsd precision mechanical seals and related products and services 
our product portfolio is built on more than well respected brand names such as worthington  idp  valtek  limitorque  and durametallic 
this portfolio is believed to be one of the most comprehensive in the industry 
the products and services are sold either directly or through designated channels to more than  companies  including some of the world s leading engineering and construction firms  original equipment manufacturers oems  distributors and end users 

table of contents our markets our products and services are used in several distinct industries oil and gas  chemical  power generation and water treatment  as well as a number of other industries that are collectively refer to as general industries 
demand for most of our products depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers 
the level of capital expenditures depends  in turn  on the general economic conditions  which are related to the phase of the cycle in their industries and the expectations of future market behavior 
the levels of maintenance spend are driven by the reliability of the equipment  planned downtimes for maintenance and the required capacity utilization of the process 
the oil and gas industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
high petroleum prices generally drove additional investment in upstream exploration and production petroleum projects and significantly contributed to the increase in bookings 
many of these projects were in asia  africa  the middle east and south america and reflect opportunities with national  international  and other major oil companies 
based on the current and future expectations of oil and gas price levels as compared to historical levels  oil and gas companies are encouraged to evaluate new resources  new technologies and explore different options such as oil sands  deepwater  heavy oil and the arctic region 
in the downstream segment of the industry refining and transportation  high crude oil prices have historically reduced the demand for our products and services from crude oil refineries and natural gas processors as they sought to take advantage of favorable refining margins by operating at high levels of capacity utilization and deferring maintenance 
the current global demand for larger amounts of oil and oil derivatives has been stimulated by the rapid economic growth in developing countries and general growth in the rest of the world 
the available refining capacity is not currently adequate to meet the market demand for refined products 
the refineries are additionally pressured by new clean fuel regulations  which result in activities such as revamps and upgrades to address these environmental concerns 
these situations have been positive for our products as oil and gas companies try to address the supply to the market with increased capacity and the right quality of products to meet tightening regulations 
output of the worldwide chemical industry during expanded slightly as compared with this was mirrored in increased capacity utilization rates in key chemical producing countries such as the united states us and germany  which recovered modestly throughout the good growth in profitability among major chemical companies and a legacy of underinvestment from to encouraged increased global capital expenditure by the chemical industry during the growth in the us chemical industry  however  was slower than in in contrast  asia pacific  particularly china continues to be a major focus of investment for the chemical industry 
although the global chemical industry is in a more mature phase of its cycle  output growth predictions provided by independent third parties for are modestly higher than for we are also seeing increased opportunities in alternative energy sources such as ethanol 
we believe this and the forecasted growth in capital expenditures should help sustain continuing healthy demand for our products from this industry 
the chemical industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
early in  high natural gas prices diminished the profitability of many power generators that in recent years made significant investments in power plants fueled by natural gas 
the profitability of these power generators improved throughout  as natural gas prices trended lower 
the power generators have been able to recover a portion of their higher costs through rate increases  but their liquidity is still challenged due to overinvestment in these power facilities in recent years and volatility in natural gas prices 
this volatility has led to a renewed interest in coal and nuclear generation plants 
a number of nuclear power generators are planning significant maintenance activities 
we have seen an increase in orders in this industry  and it has been a positive contributor to bookings  sales and earnings 
in addition  there are several coal fired power plants planned for the us and china  and we are actively pursuing the flow control opportunities for these projects 
the revenue opportunity for products at a coal fired plant typically can be three times that of a natural gas power plant 
we are also seeing increased activity in alternative energy sources such as geothermal 
the power industry represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 

table of contents worldwide demand for fresh water and water treatment continues to create demand for new facilities or for upgrades of existing systems  many of which require products that we offer  especially pumps 
we believe we are a global leader in the desalination market  which is an important source of fresh water in the mediterranean area and the middle east 
we expect that this trend in desalination will expand from the traditional areas  as previously mentioned  to other coastal areas around the globe 
this is a significant market for pump and valve actuation products 
in and  the water market represented approximately and  respectively  of our bookings 
general industries comprises a variety of different businesses  including mining and ore processing  pulp and paper  food and beverage  and other smaller applications  none of which individually represents more than of total bookings in and general industries represented approximately and of our bookings in and  respectively 
we saw some improvement in these businesses in  most notably mining and ore processing and expect stable growth in our customers include engineering contractors  oems  end users and distributors 
sales to engineering contractors and oems are typically for large project orders  as are certain sales to distributors 
project orders generally have lead times in excess of three months 
project orders are typically procured for customers either directly from us or indirectly from contractors for new construction projects or facility enhancement projects 
the quick turnaround business  which we also refer to as the book and ship business  is defined as orders that are received from the customer booked and shipped within three months of receipt 
these orders are typically for more standard products  parts or services 
each of our three business segments generates certain levels of this type of business 
we use our manufacturing platform to offer a broad array of aftermarket equipment services such as installation  advanced diagnostics  repair and retrofitting 
timelines of delivery  quality and the proximity of service centers are important considerations for aftermarket products and services 
in geographic regions where we are positioned to provide quick response  we believe customers have traditionally relied on us  rather than our competitors  for aftermarket products due to our highly engineered and customized products 
however  the aftermarket for standard products is very competitive  and price competition has generally been increasing 
price competition tends to be less significant for oems than aftermarket services and oem prices have generally been increasing due to decreased levels of supply availability 
in the sale of aftermarket products and services  we benefit from a large installed base of pumps  seals and valves  which require maintenance  repair and replacement parts 
the reporting of trends by product type  customer type and business type is based upon analytical review of individual operational results and knowledge of their respective businesses  as we do not formally track revenues by any of these categories 
these trends are analyzed as a secondary reporting mechanism that is not derived directly from our general ledger system 
our strategies our overarching objective is to grow our position as a product and integrated solutions provider in the flow control industry 
this objective includes continuing to sell products by building on existing sales relationships and marketing the power of our portfolio of products and services 
it also includes delivering specific end user solutions that help customers attain their business goals by ensuring maximum reliability at a decreased cost of ownership 
sustainable  profitable growth is being driven using six strategies that are well communicated throughout our company 
these strategies include organic growth  globalization  process excellence  portfolio management  organizational capability and technology innovation 
the key elements of these strategies are outlined below 
organic growth organic growth is an important initiative focused on growing revenues from the existing portfolio of products and services  as well as through the development of new customer driven products and services 
an overarching goal is to focus on opportunities that can maximize the organic growth from existing customers and to evaluate potential new customer partnering initiatives that maximize the capture of the product s total life cycle 
we are one of the few pump  valve and seal companies that can offer customers a differentiated option of products and services as well as offer an additional option that includes any combination of products and solution support packages across 
table of contents a very broad portfolio 
the combined pump and seal end user teams have historically been particularly successful in delivering new solution programs and increasing organic aftermarket growth 
we seek to capture additional market share by creating mutually beneficial opportunities for us and our customers through sourcing and maintenance alliance programs pursuant to which we provide all or an agreed portion of customers parts and servicing needs 
these customer alliances enable us to develop long term professional relationships with our customers and serve as an effective platform for introducing new products and services to our customers and generating additional sales 
we also seek to continue to review the substantial installed pump  seal and valve base as a means to expand the aftermarket services business  as customers are increasingly using third party aftermarket service providers to reduce their fixed costs and improve profitability 
to date  the aftermarket services business has provided us with a steady source of revenues and cash flows at higher margins than original equipment sales 
this allows us to be in frequent contact with customers  building on the knowledge of customer needs and providing cross selling opportunities 
we are building on our established presence through an extensive qrc global network to provide the immediate parts  service and technical support required to effectively manage and win the aftermarket business from the installed base 
new product and service development is driven through our product management organization  working in concert with engineering  operations and sales 
the goal is to increase our revenues from new products and services developed during the last five years 
the new product development process has made significant progress in demonstrating a pipeline of new and modified products and services 
we expect our research and development costs to increase in to support the goal of increased revenues from new products and services 
globalization the globalization business initiative has several facets that include expanding our global presence to capture business outside the traditional geographic market areas china  russia  south america  middle east and africa  utilizing low cost sourcing opportunities to remain competitive in the global economy  and attracting and retaining the global intellectual capital required to support our global growth plans in the new geographical areas 
we believe there are attractive oem opportunities in international markets  particularly in south america  the middle east and asia pacific and intend to continue to utilize our global presence to further penetrate these markets 
in we signed an agreement for a joint venture in saudi arabia with al rushaid group to develop a full service repair facility and training school in support of the region 
a manufacturing facility lease was signed for a joint pump  seal and valve facility in suzhou  china and construction was initiated on a new pump facility in coimbatore  india 
the former pump facility in bangalore will be used by our valve division to expand its local footprint 
the work force at our engineering center in chennai  india was expanded  as well as at our facilities in china 
in the aftermarket services business  we seek to strategically add sites as the customers and the customer base grows in order to provide rapid response  fast delivery and onsite field repair 
a number of new qrc s have been added in we are focused on shifting  as appropriate  certain manufacturing and engineering functions to  and increasing the supply of materials and components from  lower cost areas such as india  china  mexico  south america and eastern europe 
in these areas accounted for approximately of our direct material spending  compared to approximately in we are focused on utilizing supply chain management to reduce procurement costs  including expanding purchases through reverse auctions and further consolidating the procurement of goods at a better value 
in addition  we have expanded our china presence with additional sales and supply chain professionals  new management and growth plans 
these growth plans include acquisition or development of new capabilities that will 
table of contents enhance the penetration of products in china for oil and gas and power projects  as well as provide a base for the export of products 
process excellence the process excellence initiative encapsulates ongoing programs that drive increased customer fulfillment at the lowest cost  or internal productivity 
this initiative includes driving improved customer fulfillment across our company through metrics such as on time delivery  cost reduction  quality  cycle time reduction and warranty cost reduction  continuing to develop a culture of continuous improvement that delivers maximum productivity and cost efficiencies across our company  and implementing consistent processes across our company to ensure future success as an integrated company 
we seek to increase our operational efficiency through our cip initiative  which utilizes tools such as six sigma methodology  lean manufacturing and constraint management to improve quality and processes  reduce product cycle times and lower costs 
recognizing that employees are our most valuable resource in achieving operational excellence goals  we have instituted broad cip training 
to date  more than  employees are cip trained or certified as green belts or black belts and are deployed on cip projects throughout our company in operations and the front office of the business 
as a result of the cip initiatives  we have developed and implemented processes to reduce our engineering and manufacturing process cycle time  improve on time delivery and service response time  lower inventory levels and otherwise reduce costs 
we have also experienced success in sharing and applying best practices achieved in one of our business segments and deploying those ideas to other segments of the business 
we are actively working to standardize processes and simplify our information technology platform 
to date  standard processes have been designed and agreed to by our manufacturing  supply chain  sales and service and finance departments  creating a standard blueprint for our company 
implementation of these processes using a common enterprise resource planning erp software platform has been completed in two sites  with four sites currently in the last stages of preparation for implementation 
several additional sites are in the planning stages 
we seek to continue to improve our working capital utilization  with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory 
see further discussion in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
portfolio management the continued management of our portfolio of products and services is critical to our success 
while we will continue to pursue selective acquisitions  we have been focused on smaller niche additions to the portfolio and rationalizing the current portfolio of products and services to ensure alignment with customers 
we intend to continue to evaluate acquisition  joint ventures and other investment opportunities as we seek to broaden our product portfolio and operational capabilities and to expedite expansion into the faster growing asian  african and south american markets 
during the past year  we took advantage of smaller niche opportunities that helped round out our presence or filled small gaps in the portfolio 
these smaller acquisitions included current and non current assets and intellectual property 
product management teams also continue to work to streamline the portfolio by rationalizing products that competed internally  had been superseded by new products or were not able to reach internal rates of return 
organizational capability we believe there are several elements to building an enhanced organizational capability  including developing a deeper internal talent pool through training and cross divisional and functional assignments to allow our company the flexibility to grow and expand the organization  
table of contents capturing the intellectual capital in the current workforce  as well as that of the customers  and being able to share it within our company and with customers as a competitive advantage  developing talent acquisition programs to address critical talent needs to support our global growth  and building an organization with strengthened compliance to mandatory and recommended processes and procedures and implementing the information systems that ensure compliance 
we continue to focus on training through the distribution of electronic learning packages in multiple languages for our code of business conduct  workplace harassment  facility safety  export compliance and other regulatory and compliance programs throughout our company 
in addition  in we launched a new rotating equipment specialist program aimed at capturing internal intellectual capital and improving the capabilities of the internal workforce in an effort to provide better service to our customers 
this is a very comprehensive program that will continue through and with the goal of educating more than  of our front line employees across the globe 
technology innovation the infusion of new product technologies has become a core requirement as we evaluate the development of new products and services 
the objective is to improve the percentage of new products as a function of revenue during the next five years with the investment in technology being a critical part of success 
in  a number of opportunities were pursued in technology for smart equipment  energy efficiency of products  use of radio frequency identification  advanced technology for monitoring wear  sub sea and geothermal technologies  as well as developing new products to meet the demands of customers 
this investment in technology will continue to increase in a cross divisional technology team is in place to ensure that the technologies developed are available for wide use across all divisions to maximize the return on investments 
the primary application of advanced technology is in adding self diagnostic capabilities into our products 
this includes the intelligence required to provide customers with advanced warning of required maintenance  allowing their operations to reach optimal productivity 
our results of operations effective december   we changed our method of accounting for us inventories from the last in  first out method to the first in  first out fifo method 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  we have retrospectively adjusted prior interim and annual periods to reflect the results and balances that would have been reported had we applied the fifo method of accounting for inventories for all periods presented in this md a and in the consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  annual report

see additional detail in note to our consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report 
as a result of selling certain non core service operations  collectively called the general services group gsg  which was previously included in fcd  in december  and our government marine business unit gmbu  an fpd business  in november  we treated these dispositions as discontinued operations for the years ended december  and the gain of million from discontinued operations in represents the reduction in the loss on the sale of gsg as a result of the resolution of the contingent sales price 
the loss from discontinued operations  net of tax  increased million in  compared to a loss of million in the increase is due primarily to the impairment of certain assets owned by gsg  which is more fully discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report

backlog of billion at december  increased by million  or  as compared with currency effects provided an increase of approximately million 
the increase resulted primarily from increased bookings as discussed above 
the increase in total bookings reflects an increase in orders for engineered products  which naturally have longer lead times  as well as expanded lead times at the request of certain customers 
by the end of  we expect to ship over of this backlog 
backlog of million at december  increased by million  or  as compared with currency effects provided a decrease of approximately million 
the increase in backlog is primarily attributable to the strong bookings performance in  as well as an increase in large oil and gas project orders in ema for fpd 
sales amounts in millions sales sales in increased by million  or  as compared with the increase includes currency benefits of approximately million 
the increase in sales is primarily attributable to continued strength in the oil and gas industry  particularly in north america and the middle east  which has significantly impacted fpd and fcd 
fcd has also been positively impacted by strength in the process valve industry  particularly in asia 
additional capacity has enabled fsd to increase its aftermarket sales 
sales in increased by million  or  as compared with the increase includes currency benefits of approximately million

gross profit and gross profit margin amounts in millions gross profit gross profit margin gross profit margin in of increased from in gross profit margin in was positively impacted by various cip and supply chain initiatives 
our cip initiative is driving increased throughput on existing capacity  reduced cycle time  lean manufacturing and reduced warranty costs 
our supply chain initiatives focus on materials costs savings through low cost supply sources  long term supply agreements and product outsourcing

this increase is due to a million increase in customer bookings  which is primarily attributable to ema and south america  as well as a million increase in interdivision bookings which are eliminated and are not included in consolidated bookings as disclosed above 
the increase is attributable to growth from projects including oems and end user markets with the majority of the increase coming from regions outside north america 
success in the end user market continues to be a strength based on the fsd business model  which places a premium on servicing customers locally through an increasing network of qrcs 
during the period we added  rebuilt  upgraded or relocated qrcs to further improve our ability to service our customers in their locale 
the bookings improvement continues to reflect fsd s ability to establish long term customer alliance programs  including fixed fee contracts 
this strategy of signing special fixed fee alliances in conjunction with the higher levels of local service that comes from the strategically located qrcs has led to market share gains in over of the million of bookings in  approximately were from oil and gas  chemical and general industries

this increase in bookings reflects increased business in projects  which includes oems  and the aftermarket 
we experienced strong growth in compressor and pump seals in the project business and continued success with end users due to a focus on servicing customers locally through our increasing network of qrcs 
in addition  the bookings improvement reflects fsd s success in establishing longer term customer alliance programs  including fixed fee alliances 
fixed fee alliances are contractual agreements with customers wherein the customer pays us a fixed amount each period usually monthly for the term of the agreement 
in return for this fixed cost  the customer is entitled to new seals  repairs  upgraded equipment  replacements and maintenance services as defined within the scope of each agreement 
we believe the fixed fee strategy coupled with higher levels of customer service  reliability  drive for repair business  equipment upgrades  replacements and maintenance services have led to increases in market share in and of the million of bookings in  approximately were from oil and gas  chemical and general industries

the change in is primarily a result of the debt paydown 
our cash needs for the next months are expected to be substantially similar to  except for decreases in payments of long term debt and repurchases of common shares see discussion below  partially offset by an increase in capital expenditures related to information technology infrastructure and capacity expansion  as well as prospective dividend payments 
our pension contributions are currently expected to be less in as compared with  but will be re evaluated later in we believe cash flows from operating activities  combined with availability under our revolving line of credit and our existing cash balances  will be sufficient to enable us to meet our cash flow needs for the next months 
however  cash flows from operations could be adversely affected by economic  political and other risks associated with sales of our products  operational factors  competition  regulatory actions  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and fluctuations in interest rates  among other factors 
we believe that cash flows from operating activities and our expectation of continuing availability to draw upon our revolving credit agreements are also sufficient to meet our cash flow needs for the periods exceeding the next months 
we had a substantial number of outstanding stock options granted in past years to employees and directors under our stock option plans that were previously unexercisable due to the non current status of our filings with the sec

pension and postretirement benefits obligations our pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
we consider accounting for retirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  retirement  turnover  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding

plan description we and certain of our subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full time and part time employees 
the defined benefit pension plan in the us is the flowserve corporation pension plan and the defined contribution plan is the flowserve corporation retirement savings plan 
approximately of total defined benefit pension plan assets and of benefit obligations are related to the us plan as of december  the assets for the us plan are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation 
unless specified otherwise  the references in this section are to total plans ie  the ie plan together with international plans 
benefits under our defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants compensation 
assets under our defined benefit pension plans consist primarily of equity and fixed 
table of contents income securities 
at december   the fair market value of plan assets for our defined benefit plans increased to million from million at december  assets were allocated as follows us plan us plans asset category equity securities fixed income other the projected benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
none of our common stock is directly held by these plans 
we sponsor a defined benefit postretirement health care plan covering most current retirees and a limited number of future retirees in the us this plan provides for medical and dental benefits and is administered through insurance companies 
we fund the plan as benefits are paid  such that the plans hold no assets in any period presented 
accordingly  we have no investment strategy or targeted allocations for plan assets 
the benefits under the plan are not available to new employees or most existing employees 
the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for our defined benefit postretirement health care plan was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
accrual accounting and significant assumptions consistent with the requirements of sfas no 
 we account for pension benefits using the accrual method  recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees 
the accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
our key assumptions used in calculating our cost of pension benefits are the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase  and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
we  in consultation with our actuaries  evaluate the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating the cost of pension benefits  such as discount rate  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  life expectancy of participants and assumed rate of wage increases  and determine such assumptions as of december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year 
depending on the assumptions used  the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding 
actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors 
the assumed discount rate used for determining future pension obligations is based on indices of aa rated corporate bonds  except for two foreign locations which use government bonds 
the assumed rate of compensation increase used for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due to general price levels  productivity  seniority and other factors 
the expected long term rate of return on assets was determined by assessing the rates of return for each targeted asset class  return premiums generated by active portfolio management and by comparison of rates utilized by other companies 
in  net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in income from continuing operations was million compared to million in and million in the postretirement benefit expense for the postretirement health care plan was million in compared to million in and million in the decline in is primarily attributable to plan amendments capping our liabilities and to a decrease in the number of participants 

table of contents the following are assumptions related to our defined benefit pension plans for the year ended december  us plan us plans weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels weighted average assumptions used to determine net cost long term rate of return on assets discount rate rate of increase in compensation levels the following provides a sensitivity analysis of alternative assumptions on the us qualified and aggregate us pension plans and us postretirement plans

at december   we increased our assumed discount rate for the us plan from to consistent with increased year bond yields and our average rate for non us plans from to 
we maintained our average assumed rate of compensation increase at for the us plan 
the increase in the discount rate had the effect of decreasing the present value of benefit obligations and  accordingly  decreased pension expense for we decreased the expected rate of return on us plan assets from for to for  primarily to reflect reduced expected long term equity returns 

table of contents we expect that the net pension expense for our defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before income taxes will be approximately million lower in than the million in  reflecting  among other things  the increase in the assumed discount rate and an expected reduction in the rate of return on plan assets 
we expect the expense for the postretirement health care plan to be million 
we have used the same assumed discount rates of and at december  and  respectively  in calculating our cost of pension benefits and our cost of other postretirement benefits for us plans 
the assumed ranges for the annual rates of increase in per capita costs were for  for and for  with a gradual decrease to for and future years 
if actual costs are higher than those assumed  this will likely put modest upward pressure on our expense for retiree health care 
plan funding our funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute at least the amounts required under applicable laws and local customs 
we contributed million  million and million to our defined benefit plans in  and  respectively 
in  we expect to contribute approximately million to our qualified us pension plan  and we expect to contribute approximately million to our non us pension plans 
on august   president bush signed into law the pension protection act of the ppa 
among other things  the ppa established minimum funding standards for defined benefit plans for plan years beginning after and provided for accelerated vesting of employer contributions to defined contribution plans beginning in we are still evaluating the impact of the ppa on our future funding of our us defined benefit pension plans 
for further discussions on retirement benefits  see note to our consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report 
our critical accounting estimates the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of related contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon information available at the time of the estimates or assumptions  including our historical experience  where relevant 
the most significant estimates made by management include  timing and amount of revenue recognition  deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves  reserves for contingent losses  retirement and postretirement benefits  and valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
the significant estimates are reviewed quarterly by management with oversight by our disclosure control committee  an internal committee comprised of members of senior management  and the disclosure control committee presents its views to the audit committee of our board of directors 
because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates  assumptions and judgments used in the preparation of our financial statements  actual results may differ from the estimates  and the difference may be material 
our critical accounting policies are those policies that are both most important to our financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the following represent our critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of our significant accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
management and our external auditors have discussed our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition revenues for product sales are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the customers  which is based on the contractual delivery terms agreed to with the customer and fulfillment of all but inconsequential or perfunctory actions 
in addition  our policy requires persuasive evidence of an arrangement  a fixed or determinable sales price and reasonable assurance of collectibility 
for contracts containing multiple 
table of contents elements  each having a determinable fair value  we recognize revenue in an amount equal to the elements pro rata share of the contract s fair value in accordance with the contractual delivery terms for each element 
if a customer arrangement requires formal acceptance  revenue is not recognized until formal acceptance has been received 
freight charges billed to customers are included in sales and the related shipping costs are included in cost of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
revenues for long term contracts  which include contracts that exceed certain internal thresholds regarding the size and duration of the project and provide for the receipt of progress billings from the customer  are recorded on the percentage of completion method with progress measured on a cost to cost basis 
percentage of completion revenue represents approximately of our consolidated sales in revenue on service and repair contracts is recognized after services have been agreed to by the customer and rendered 
revenues generated under fixed fee service and repair contracts are recognized on a ratable basis over the term of the contract 
these contracts can range in duration  but generally extend for up to five years 
fixed fee service contracts represent less than of our consolidated sales in in certain instances  we provide guaranteed completion dates under the terms of our contracts 
failure to meet contractual delivery dates can result in unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs 
in instances where the payment of such costs are deemed to be probable  we perform a project profitability analysis accounting for such costs as a reduction of realizable revenues  which could potentially cause estimated total project costs to exceed projected total revenues realized from the project 
in such instances  we would record reserves to cover such excesses in the period they are determined  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
in circumstances where the total projected reduced revenues still exceed total projected costs  the incurrence of unrealized incentive fees or non recoverable costs generally reduces profitability of the project at the time of subsequent revenue recognition 
our reported results would change if different estimates were used for contract costs or if different estimates were used for contractual contingencies 
deferred taxes  tax valuation allowances and tax reserves we recognize valuation allowances to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets to amounts that we expect are more likely than not to be realized 
our valuation allowances primarily relate to the deferred tax assets established for certain tax credit carryforwards and net operating loss carryforwards for us and non us subsidiaries  and we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing the related valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of these allowances  if necessary 
we assess such factors as our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets in determining the sufficiency of our valuation allowances 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable tax jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in our effective tax rate on future earnings 
implementation of different tax structures in certain jurisdictions could  if successful  result in future reductions of certain valuation allowances 
the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal  state and foreign tax authorities  which often result in proposed assessments 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions 
we establish reserves for open tax years for certain positions that are subject to challenge by various tax authorities 
the consolidated tax provision and related accruals include the impact of such reasonably estimable losses and related interest as deemed appropriate 
we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters  and our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities 
to the extent that the expected tax outcome of these matters changes  such changes in estimate will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determination is made 
reserves for contingent loss liabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business when it is both probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable 
assessments of reserves are based on information obtained from our independent and in house experts  including recent legal decisions and loss experience in similar situations 
the recorded legal reserves are susceptible to changes due to new developments regarding the facts and 
table of contents circumstances of each matter  changes in political environments  legal venue and other factors 
recorded environmental reserves could change based on further analysis of our properties  technological innovation and regulatory environment changes 
retirement and postretirement benefits determination of the value of our retirement and postretirement benefits liabilities is based on actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions that are assessed annually in the fourth quarter and which include discount rates  expected return on plan assets for funded plans  life expectancy of participants  assumed rate of wage increases  and assumed rate of health care cost increases 
we evaluate  in conjunction with our professional advisors  prevailing market conditions in countries where plans are maintained  including appropriate rates of return  interest rates and medical inflation rates 
specifically for our us plan  we assess such market factors as changes in the cash balance interest crediting rate  borrowing rates for investment grade corporate and industrial companies  assumptions used by fortune companies  our actual wage increases in recent years  expected rates of return for each targeted asset class held by the plans and return premiums generated by active investment management 
for the non us plans we perform similar analyses  but also factor in local laws and requirements 
we also compare our significant assumptions with our peers and discuss our key assumptions  prior to their incorporation into actuarial calculations  with the finance committee of our board of directors 
we evaluate the funded status of each retirement plan using current assumptions and determine the appropriate funding level considering applicable regulatory requirements  tax deductibility  reporting considerations  cash flow requirements and other factors 
valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets we record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles and other intangibles at fair value  as required by sfas no 
 business combinations 
the initial recording of goodwill and intangibles requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
we test the value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment as of december each year or whenever events or circumstances indicate such assets may be impaired 
the test for goodwill impairment involves significant judgment in estimating projections of fair value generated through future performance of each of the reporting units  which correlate to our operating segments 
the test of indefinite lived intangibles involves significant judgment in estimating projections of future sales levels 
impairment losses for goodwill are recognized whenever the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value 
impairment losses for intangibles are recognized whenever the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value 
in calculating the fair value of the reporting units using the present value of estimated future cash flows  we rely on a number of factors including operating results  business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows and market data used in discounting those cash flows 
inherent uncertainties exist in determining and applying such factors 
the discount rate used in the projection of fair value represents an internally estimated weighted average cost of capital of 
the net realizable value of other long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  is reviewed periodically  when indicators of potential impairments are present  based upon an assessment of the estimated future cash flows related to those assets  utilizing methodologies similar to that for goodwill and indefinite lived assets 
additional considerations related to our long lived assets include expected maintenance and improvements  changes in expected uses and ongoing operating performance and utilization 

table of contents due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that forecasts used to support asset carrying values may change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
accounting developments we have presented the information about accounting pronouncements not yet implemented in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
outlook for our future results of operations and other forward looking statements contained in this annual report  including this md a  involve a number of risks and uncertainties in particular  the statements regarding our goals and strategies  new product introductions  plans to cultivate new businesses  future economic conditions  revenue  pricing  gross margin and costs  capital spending  depreciation and amortization  research and development expenses  potential impairment of investments  the tax rate  and pending tax and legal proceedings 
our future results of operations may also be affected by the amount  type  and valuation of the share based awards granted as well as the amount of awards forfeited due to employee turnover 
in addition to the various important factors discussed above  a number of other factors could cause actual results to differ materially from our expectations 
see the risks described in risk factors in part i  item a included in this annual report 
we experienced continued strengthening in our markets in and we remain optimistic about our markets and our performance in  considering that the economic opportunities in many of our geographic and core industrial markets continue to be strong 
as a result of these factors  our revenues are expected to increase from  excluding currency fluctuations 
for additional discussion on our markets  see the business overview our markets section of this md a 
our bookings for continuing operations increased in as compared with we believe this will translate into increased revenue in however  as a booking represents a contract that can be modified or canceled  there is no guarantee that the increase in bookings will result in the same increase in revenues 
additionally  as customer requested lead times have extended  the timing for conversion of a booking into revenue is extending accordingly 
we expect our operating income to increase in as compared with  although there are a numbers of factors that could have a significant impact on our operating income in we believe our operating income should continue to benefit from a number of operational improvement programs  including the procurement program and the cip initiative  as well as other operational improvements in several of our facilities 
in addition  continuation of our end user strategy  and selective contract bidding may also positively contribute to our operating income in however  a number of significant costs and certain other expenses will negatively impact our operating income in these include selected investments in technology infrastructure to consolidate our erp systems  enhancements to our cip initiative  professional fees incurred in the development of tax strategies and enhancement of our compliance programs  an increase in research and development spending  non cash stock compensation expenses primarily related to the adoption of sfas no 
r  and higher wage and benefit costs due to inflation 
additionally  the large proportion of original equipment business booked in by fpd may have some negative pressure on gross margin percentage as those are shipped in and beyond 
while we expect our tax rate in to be less than in  several things could negatively impact it  including the adoption of fin no 
in following the refinancing of our previous credit facilities and senior subordinated notes in august  of our debt carries a floating rate of interest 
as of december  we had million of derivative contracts to convert a portion of floating interest rates to fixed interest rates to reduce our exposure to interest rate volatility 
as a result of our lower levels of debt in  we expect our interest expense will be lower in as compared with however  because a portion of our debt carries a floating rate of interest  the debt is subject to volatility in rates  which could negatively impact interest expense 
our results of operations may also be impacted by unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
table of contents we expect to generate sufficient cash from operations to fund our business  capital expenditures  pension plan contribution obligations and continue to reduce debt levels 
we seek to continue to improve our working capital utilization  with a particular focus on improving the management of accounts receivable and inventory 
however  the amount of cash generated from working capital is dependent on the level of revenues  backlog and other factors 
our plan for capital expenditures in is to focus on capacity expansion  enterprise resource planning application upgrades  information technology infrastructure and cost reduction opportunities and are expected to be between approximately million and million  before consideration of any acquisition activity 
currently  no significant acquisitions are imminent 
while current pension regulations allow us latitude in the amount of contributions  we currently anticipate that our contributions to our qualified us pension plan will be approximately million in we currently anticipate that our contributions to our non us pension plans will be approximately million in we have million in scheduled repayments in under our credit facilities 
we expect to comply with the covenants under our credit facilities in see the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a for further discussion of our debt covenants 
as we have discussed in this and prior publicly filed reports  we are currently subject to lawsuits  internal investigations and regulatory investigations in the us and in foreign countries  which could negatively impact our cash flows and results of operations 
we believe we are currently dealing with these matters appropriately  and we are diligently striving to achieve the most favorable results 
in  the board of directors approved a share repurchase program that authorized the company to repurchase up to two million shares of common stock 
as of december   million shares had been repurchased under the program  and an additional million shares had been purchased as of february  we expect to fund the program using existing cash and cash provided by operations  borrowings and stock option exercises 
we expect that our corporate representatives will  from time to time  meet privately with investors  investment analysts  the media and others  and may reiterate the forward looking statements contained in this outlook for section and elsewhere in this annual report  including any such statements that are incorporated by reference in this annual report 
at the same time  we will keep this annual report and our most current business outlook publicly available on our investor relations web site www

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks associated with financial instruments we have market risk exposure arising from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate movements 
we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge our risks associated with transactions denominated in currencies other than the local currency of the operation engaging in the transaction 
our risk management and derivatives policy specifies the conditions under which we may enter into derivative contracts 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of notional amount in outstanding forward contracts with third parties 
at december   the length of forward contracts currently in place was two days to months 
the fair market value adjustments of a substantial portion of our forward contracts are recognized directly in our results of operations

also as part of our risk management program  we enter into interest rate swap agreements to hedge exposure to floating interest rates on certain portions of our debt 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of notional amount in outstanding interest rate swaps with third parties 
at december   the maximum remaining length of any interest rate contract in place was approximately months

unrealized gains from the changes in fair value of our interest rate swap agreements  net of reclassifications  of million and million  net of tax  for the years ended december  and  respectively  are included in other comprehensive income loss 
we are exposed to risk from credit related losses resulting from nonperformance by counterparties to our financial instruments 
we perform credit evaluations of our counterparties under forward contracts and interest rate swap agreements and expect all counterparties to meet their obligations 
we have not experienced credit losses from our counterparties 
our earnings are impacted by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under our credit facilities  which bear interest based on floating rates 
at december   after the effect of interest rate swaps  we had approximately million of variable rate debt obligations outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical change of basis points in the interest rate for these borrowings  assuming constant variable rate debt levels  would change interest expense by approximately million 
we employ a foreign currency hedging strategy to minimize potential losses in earnings or cash flows from unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements 
these strategies also minimize potential gains from favorable exchange rate movements 
foreign currency exposures arise from transactions  including firm commitments and anticipated transactions  denominated in a currency other than an entity s functional currency and from translation of foreign denominated assets and liabilities into us dollars 
based on a sensitivity analysis at december   and before consideration of any outstanding forward contracts  a adverse change in the foreign currency exchange rates could impact our results of operations for by million
