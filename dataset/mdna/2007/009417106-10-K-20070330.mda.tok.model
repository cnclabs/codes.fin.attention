the sale was completed on september  the purchase price was million in cash  of which million was consideration for the sale of nine company owned aircraft and related engine maintenance programs and million was consideration for the sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of a newly created subsidiary of jetride  also called jetride  inc new jetride 
upon completion of the sale transaction  jetride amended its articles of incorporation to change its name to starcheck  inc 
of the total consideration  million was paid at closing and million was paid into escrow to cover indemnification claims which may be made by pinnacle for up to eighteen months after the closing 
to the extent the escrow amount is not used to satisfy indemnification claims  the escrow amount is to be released to airnet in two installments approximately six and twelve months after the closing 
in march   of the escrowed amount was released to airnet 
airnet retained the net working capital of the jetride business  which was approximately million as of the closing date 
in connection with the closing of the sale transaction  jetride repaid in full six term loans which had been secured by aircraft used in jetride s 
table of contents passenger charter business 
the aggregate principal amount of the loans repaid was approximately million plus accrued interest and early termination prepayment penalties of approximately million through the repayment date 
following repayment of jetride s loans and expenses related to the transaction  airnet used the remaining sale proceeds to further reduce debt outstanding under airnet s secured revolving credit facility 
airnet s lenders under the secured revolving credit facility had consented to the sale of the jetride passenger charter business and the various transactions necessary to complete the sale 
in connection with the transaction  airnet agreed to provide certain transition services to pinnacle and its subsidiaries for various specified time periods and various monthly fees  which initially aggregate to approximately  per month  primarily for aircraft maintenance management services 
in addition  airnet entered into three subleases with new jetride  each for a one year term  under which new jetride leases a portion of airnet s facilities located at rickenbacker international airport  dallas love field and birmingham international airport 
the aggregate lease payment under the three subleases is approximately  per month 
pinnacle made offers of employment to all of the employees of jetride and substantially all of the jetride pilots and other employees accepted employment with pinnacle 
wynn d 
peterson  who had served as airnet s senior vice president  jetride services  resigned as an executive officer of airnet to become president of pinnacle and new jetride  which became a subsidiary of pinnacle upon completion of the sale transaction 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets airnet has classified the assets and liabilities of passenger charter services as assets and liabilities related to discontinued operations and presented this operating segment s results of operations as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
as a result of the disposition of the jetride passenger charter business  airnet has only one reportable segment 
revenues from passenger charter services  included in discontinued operations  were approximately million  million and million for  and  respectively 
income from discontinued operations before income taxes for  and was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
included in the income from discontinued operations before income taxes is a pre tax gain of approximately million  which is net of approximately million of investment banking and legal fees associated with the sale of jetride 
bank services bank services  primarily consisting of cancelled check delivery  generated approximately  and of airnet s total net revenues for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
airnet s time critical cancelled check delivery service allows its banking customers to reduce their float costs and related processing fees 
airnet also transports other items  such as proof of deposit transactions and interoffice mail  for many of the same bank customers 
the us banking industry  including commercial banks and third party processors  represents airnet s largest category of customers 
airnet s bank customers represent many of the nation s largest bank holding companies 
express services express services  which focus on customers with time critical delivery needs  generated approximately  and of airnet s total net revenues for the fiscal years ended december   and  respectively 
express services are primarily targeted at customers involved in the life sciences  and media and entertainment industries  and other customers whose shipment needs are highly time sensitive  time definite or highly controlled 
in the life sciences industry  express services are offered to customers shipping packages that require specialized handling  the transportation of which is often highly regulated by various governmental authorities 
targeted markets within the life sciences industry include producers and recipients of radioactive pharmaceuticals  diagnostic specimens  blood  umbilical cord blood  human tissue and organs 
for those customers requiring time critical delivery options not available on airnet s regularly scheduled routes  cargo charter services are available 
cargo charter services may be regularly scheduled or scheduled on an on demand  as needed basis  hours per day  seven days a week 
aviation services airnet operates a fixed base operation from its columbus  ohio facility  offering retail aviation fuel sales and aircraft maintenance 
airnet continues to provide aircraft maintenance and director of maintenance management services for new jetride after the sale of the jetride passenger charter business in september airnet also provides aircraft maintenance services for pinnacle aircraft  and for other corporate aircraft and expects to increase its retail maintenance services in 
table of contents business strategy airnet plans to continue to provide transportation services to the banking industry  but expects that its bank services revenues will continue to decline in future periods as a result of the increasing use by bank services customers of image products and other electronic alternatives to the physical movement of cancelled checks 
airnet will continue to evaluate and adjust its network fleet operation and size in response to these changing business conditions and the needs of its express services customers 
airnet is working with individual bank services customers to understand their future transportation requirements and to restructure contractual relationships 
airnet is requesting that many of its more significant bank services customers provide airnet with an estimate of their future air transportation requirements to assist airnet in planning changes to its transportation network 
these estimates will allow airnet to restructure its transportation network and provide advance notice of such changes to its customers thereby providing a measure of service predictability for those customers 
in addition  airnet will review its ground operations for efficiencies and cost reductions as airnet reduces its air transportation network 
airnet will continue to focus on maximizing cash flow 
during the fiscal years ended december  and  airnet reduced its outstanding debt by approximately million and million  respectively  of which approximately million in related to the sale of jetride s passenger charter business  as described above 
airnet s business strategy is focused on increasing express services revenues in and subsequent years 
airnet intends to increase its focus on express services customers in time critical  time definite  and high control delivery markets  including medical testing laboratories  radioactive pharmaceuticals  medical equipment  controlled sensitive media and mission critical parts 
airnet also intends to establish relationships with specialized freight forwarders operating in these markets that may benefit from the competitive advantages offered by airnet s air transportation network 
airnet believes its air transportation network provides certain competitive advantages over other freight forwarders that must rely primarily upon commercial passenger airlines to process their shipments 
these advantages include later tendering times  better on time performance  greater control of shipments  reliable shipment tracking systems and greater flexibility in the design of transportation solutions for customers with specific needs 
the current aircraft in airnet s fleet were originally designed to meet the delivery needs of airnet s bank customers and have relatively small cargo capacities 
airnet s current aircraft are not readily adaptable to the transportation of many types of larger air cargo 
therefore  airnet intends to focus on customers with smaller sized package requirements in the time critical  time definite and high control delivery markets 
airnet also is evaluating other types of aircraft that may be more suitable for the transportation of packages for express services customers 
if airnet is unable to significantly increase its express services revenues and contribution margins  the anticipated decline in airnet s bank services revenues will require significant changes in airnet s air transportation network  including further reductions in its airline route schedule  the number of aircraft it operates  and operating and administrative costs 
airnet plans on utilizing its internal aircraft maintenance competency by providing retail maintenance services for new jetride  other part air carriers  and other corporate owned aircraft 
additionally  airnet expects that it will be necessary to implement cost reductions in its administration  ground support and air operations 
airnet will continue to evaluate and adjust its current fleet and aircraft types in terms of future service requirements and maintenance and operating costs and expects to make additional changes in its aircraft fleet over time 
in december  airnet entered into an agreement to sell all nine of its cessna aircraft for approximately million 
in january of  airnet engaged brown gibbons lang company bgl to serve as airnet s exclusive financial advisor and investment banker to review  develop and evaluate various strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value  including the possible sale of airnet 
airnet received indications of interest with respect to the sale of airnet  which culminated in the execution of a letter of intent for the sale of airnet on october  on december   airnet announced that it had been unable to reach a definitive merger agreement with the private equity investment firm that entered into the letter of intent and that the exclusivity period under such letter of intent had been allowed to expire 
following the termination of the letter of intent  in december of  the airnet board of directors dissolved the special committee which had been established to oversee the marketing process and appointed a strategy committee to work with management on the ongoing business strategy and alternatives for airnet to enhance shareholder value 
the strategy committee  together with the full airnet board  determined that airnet s business strategy would include operating its businesses with an emphasis on cash flows from operations while seeking other de leveraging opportunities 
the airnet board elected to continue the engagement of bgl as its financial advisor on a month to month basis in connection with the development and evaluation of various strategies and opportunities to enhance shareholder value and de leverage the business 
in september  airnet sold its jetride passenger charter business and thereafter concluded its month to month engagement with bgl 
airnet continues to consult with bgl from time to time on various strategies and opportunities to enhance shareholder value 
on february   the airnet board dissolved the strategy committee following the appointment of mr 
bruce d 
parker as chairman of the board and his assumption of the position of chief executive officer of airnet on december  
table of contents operations air operations airnet s air operations are headquartered in columbus  ohio 
in june  airnet relocated its operational headquarters from port columbus international airport port columbus to rickenbacker international airport rickenbacker 
airnet utilizes an extensive screening process to evaluate potential pilots prior to hiring 
new pilots must meet stringent company qualifications  as well as mandated federal aviation administration faa requirements 
new pilots must satisfactorily complete a five week training program conducted by airnet s flight training staff prior to assignment of pilot duties 
this training program includes flight simulator training prior to any actual flight time in an airnet aircraft  as well as intensive ground instruction 
additionally  new pilots gain operating experience in a structured setting prior to assignment in order to gain a familiarity with airnet s route system and the unique demands of the flight environment 
airnet s central dispatch system coordinates all components of the air cargo operation 
departure and arrival times are continuously updated  and weather conditions throughout the nation are monitored 
airnet dispatchers remain in contact with pilots  out based hub managers  fuelers  maintenance technicians and ground delivery personnel to identify and minimize any potential delays in the delivery process 
capacity management is an important factor in maintaining profitability of airnet s package delivery services 
airnet s air transportation network is positioned around a flexible national route structure designed to facilitate late pick up and early delivery times  minimize delays and simplify flight scheduling 
airnet s flexible route structure allows it to respond to the changing volume needs of its customers 
airnet s primary hub in columbus  ohio  and several mini hubs across the nation  are located primarily in less congested regional airports 
these locations  in conjunction with airnet s off peak departure and arrival times  provide easy take off and landings  convenient loading and unloading and fast refueling and maintenance 
airnet also uses commercial passenger airlines  primarily to transport shipments during the daytime and weekend hours when its aircraft are operating under a limited flight schedule 
airnet employs approximately aircraft and avionics technicians in five separate locations across the united states who perform maintenance on airnet s fleet of aircraft 
airnet has an in house engine shop at its columbus facility where some of the piston engines are overhauled on site  thereby reducing aircraft downtime and controlling costs 
airnet also performs avionics troubleshooting and repair at its columbus facility to provide for maximum efficiency and minimum aircraft downtime for the fleet 
airnet s aircraft maintenance center at its columbus hub has received iso certification and holds a repair station certificate granted by the faa 
shipment processing bank shipments are pre sorted by bank customer personnel and packaged in airnet supplied bags with three letter city identifier tags to show final destination 
express shipments are packaged in either airnet provided packaging or the customers packaging 
shipments transported on airnet s air transportation network are typically picked up by a courier and transported to the local airport where an airbill is either scanned using bar code technology or entered manually 
information on each airbill pertaining to the shipper  receiver  airbill number and applicable deadline is captured and downloaded into airnet s computer system  where it is available to airnet s customer service representatives csrs 
upon arrival at airnet s columbus hub or one of its mini hubs  the shipment is off loaded  sorted by destination and reloaded onto an aircraft 
at the final destination city  the shipment is off loaded and delivered by courier to the receiver 
when delivered  information from the airbill is once again captured and downloaded into airnet s computer system 
delivery information for all shipments is then available on line to customers and airnet s csrs 
for banking customers meeting daytime banking deadlines and express customers requiring next flight out timing  shipments are typically picked up by a courier and transported via commercial airlines or other integrators to destination cities where couriers recover the packages and deliver them to their final destinations 
ground support airnet manages its ground delivery services primarily through a network of vendor couriers 
the use of vendor couriers to perform the majority of ground delivery services  allows airnet to better match its ground costs with its volume requirements 
in limited situations  employees are used for ground delivery services on scheduled routes where volume requirements economically justify employing full time couriers 
dispatching functions related to ground delivery services occur at airnet s columbus  ohio hub and on a regional basis in some of the major cities served 
fast forward solutions fast forward solutions  llc fast forward solutions  a wholly owned subsidiary of airnet  was formed in august to explore growth opportunities associated with existing and emerging image replacement platforms and technologies 
fast 
table of contents forward solutions is no longer pursuing opportunities in the image replacement market and airnet expects to dissolve fast forward solutions during the fiscal year ending december   without any financial impact 
regulation airnet holds an air carrier operating certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part of the federal aviation regulations 
airnet also holds a repair station certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part of the federal aviation regulations 
in addition  until the sale of jetride s passenger charter business in september  jetride held its own air carrier operating certificate granted by the faa pursuant to part airnet s certificates are of unlimited duration and remain in effect so long as airnet maintains the required standards of safety and meet the operational requirements of the federal aviation regulations 
the faa s regulatory authority relates primarily to operational aspects of air transportation  including aircraft standards and maintenance  personnel  and ground facilities 
the u 
s 
department of transportation dot and transportation security administration tsa have regulatory authority concerning operational and security concerns in transportation  including safety  insurance and hazardous materials 
airnet holds various operational certificates issued by these and other governmental agencies  including grantee status to dot sp special permit and a transport canada permit for equivalent level of safety  which permit airnet to transport higher volumes of time critical radioactive pharmaceuticals than is allowed by the dot and transport canada for most carriers 
airnet s grantee status under the dot sp special permit expires in august and its permit for equivalent level of safety expires in march these permits may be renewed at such times 
airnet is also subject to regulation by the food and drug administration  which regulates the transportation of pharmaceuticals and live animals  as well as by various state and local authorities 
airnet believes that it has all permits  approvals and licenses required to conduct its operations and that it is in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements relating to its operations  including all applicable noise level regulations 
airnet transports packages on both its airline and on commercial airlines 
the tsa requires that airnet maintain certain security programs related to its operations  including a twelve five standard security program tfssp and an indirect air carrier standard security program iacssp 
the tfssp governs security procedures applicable to airnet s airline and the iacssp governs security procedures for tendering packages to commercial airlines 
airnet maintains a tsa approved tfssp 
airnet management  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of airnet airnet management  maintains a tsa approved iacssp 
airnet and airnet management believe that they are in compliance with all the requirements of the tfssp and iacssp programs that they maintain 
as a result of increased concerns regarding airline security  in may the tsa adopted new rules and regulations to enhance the security requirements relating to the transportation of cargo on both passenger and all cargo aircraft 
these new rules  when fully implemented  will require air carriers maintaining tfssp and iacssp programs to institute new or additional security measures  including enhanced training of personnel responsible for maintaining such programs or involved in the processing of air cargo  more extensive background checks of such personnel  and new rules for verifying the identity of shippers and individuals tendering packages to commercial airlines 
airnet has implemented the new tsa rules and regulations that are currently in effect and intends to implement other security measures as they become effective 
on january   the united states house of representatives passed bill hr entitled implementing the commission recommendations act of and the bill was received in the united states senate and referred to the committee on homeland security and governmental affairs 
on march   the committee on commerce  science and transportation of the united states senate reported bill s 
entitled aviation security improvement act with amendments and the bill as amended was placed on the senate legislative calendar 
if enacted  each of these bills would provide for significant further regulation and inspection screening of cargo transported on commercial passenger airlines 
if these bills are enacted  commercial passenger airlines may require earlier tendering times which may impact airnet s ability to meet current shipping timeframes for its customers 
seasonality see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation under the heading seasonality and variability in quarterly results of this annual report on form k for a discussion of the seasonal aspects of airnet s business  which discussion is incorporated herein by reference 
competition the air and ground courier industry is highly competitive 
airnet s primary competitor in the transportation of cancelled checks is the federal reserve s check relay network the crn 
the actions of the federal reserve are regulated by the monetary control act  which requires the federal reserve to price its services at actual cost plus a set percentage private sector adjustment factor 
airnet believes that the purpose of the monetary control act is to curtail the possibility of predatory pricing by the federal reserve when it competes with the private sector 
no assurance beyond the remedies of law can be given that the federal reserve will comply with the monetary control act 
on february   the federal reserve 
table of contents announced that on may  it would be significantly reducing the number of interdistrict flights on its crn as a result of a significant decline in the volume of cancelled checks to be transported 
the federal reserve also announced that it expects the crn will be discontinued by in the private sector  there are a large number of smaller  regional carriers that transport cancelled checks  none of which airnet believes has a significant interstate market share 
the two largest private sector national air carriers  fedex and united parcel service ups  both carry cancelled checks where the required deadlines fit into their existing system 
airnet does not believe that fedex or ups represents a significant competitor in the time critical cancelled check market to date 
airnet provides customized service for its customer base  often with later pick ups and earlier deliveries than the large  national air carriers provide 
airnet competes with commercial passenger airlines and numerous other carriers in its express services delivery business and estimates its market share in this industry at less than 
airnet believes that its national air transportation network  proprietary information technology and historically high on time performance level allow it to compete in this market 
in recent years  additional charter aircraft competitors have received grantee status to the dot sp special permit which has increased competition for radioactive pharmaceuticals customers 
environmental matters in  airnet commenced construction of a new corporate and operational facility the rickenbacker facility on land leased from the columbus regional airport authority the authority 
construction of the rickenbacker facility was completed in may of and airnet completed the relocation of its flight and administrative operations to the rickenbacker facility in june of portions of the leased land on which the rickenbacker facility was constructed  as well as portions of the aircraft ramp used by airnet at the rickenbacker facility  contain known pollution conditions 
the appropriate amended post closure plan and no further action letters addressing the rickenbacker facility and the aircraft ramp were obtained by airnet from the authority prior to beginning construction 
no additional pollution conditions on the leased land were noted during construction of the rickenbacker facility or the aircraft ramp and none have been noted through the date of this annual report on form k 
in june  airnet relocated its corporate and operational headquarters from international gateway in columbus  ohio the port columbus facility to the new rickenbacker facility 
airnet s lease of its port columbus facility expired on august  in connection with vacating its port columbus facility  airnet was required to conduct an environmental assessment of the port columbus facility 
the results of the environmental assessment demonstrated concentrations of petroleum hydrocarbons and vinyl chloride above the regulatory limits in samples associated with one of three oil water separators located in the hanger portion of the port columbus facility 
except for the area associated with the one oil water separator  it was the opinion of the environmental testing firm engaged to conduct the assessment that no obviously recognized environmental conditions existed at airnet s port columbus facility in the areas assessed  including the fuel farm which airnet maintained at the port columbus facility through august following completion of the environmental assessment of the port columbus facility  airnet  with the assistance of the authority  determined what actions were necessary to remediate the identified pollution conditions 
in march of  airnet completed remedial work to remove the pollution conditions  which consisted primarily of the removal and replacement of a portion of the concrete floor in the hangar area of the port columbus facility  the removal and replacement of the contaminated soil  and the installation of a new oil water separator 
environmental testing conducted upon the completion of the remedial work demonstrated no presence of petroleum hydrocarbons or vinyl chloride above the regulatory limits in the area associated with the remedial work 
airnet also maintained certain assets at port columbus for dispensing aviation fuel under the terms and conditions of a separate lease agreement the fuel farm lease 
the fuel farm lease required airnet to return the premises leased under the fuel farm lease to their original condition upon the termination of the lease 
in lieu of returning the premises to their original condition  the fuel farm lease provided that the authority could take title to any improvements constructed by airnet on the leased premises 
on august   airnet conveyed all of its fuel farm assets to the authority for and a release of any future liabilities associated with the fuel farm lease and the fuel farm assets  other than any liabilities related to environmental conditions which may be imposed by any governmental agency 
the fuel farm lease also was terminated on august  as a result of the conveyance of the fuel farm assets to the authority and the termination of the fuel farm lease  airnet was relieved of its obligation to return the leased premises to their original condition 
airnet believes that compliance with applicable laws and regulations governing environmental matters has not had  and is not expected to have  a material effect on airnet s capital expenditures  operations or competitive position 
employees as of december   airnet employed approximately persons  which included approximately pilots 
airnet s employees are not represented by any union or covered by any collective bargaining agreement 
airnet has experienced no work stoppages and believes that its relationship with employees is good 

table of contents item a risk factors the check act and electronic methods of clearing cancelled checks have had  and will continue to have  a significant adverse effect on airnet s revenues derived from check delivery services 
the check act  which became effective in october  creates a new negotiable instrument called a substitute check also known as an image replaced document or ird that becomes the legal equivalent of the original item 
the check act effectively removed the requirement of returning an original paper check to the account holder s institution and required that all financial institutions accept an ird in lieu of a cancelled check 
the check act and the transition in the banking industry to electronic methods of clearing cancelled checks will eventually replace the need for expedited air transportation services of original cancelled checks by most of airnet s banking customers 
the check act and electronic methods of clearing cancelled checks have had  and will continue to have  a significant adverse affect on airnet s revenues derived from check delivery services 
the use of image replacement documents and other electronic methods to clear cancelled checks is accelerating and will have a significant adverse effect on airnet s revenues and income 
the use of ird s and other electronic methods to clear cancelled checks is accelerating and airnet is experiencing significant declines in the volume of cancelled checks it delivers 
the acceleration in the use of electronic methods of clearing checks will have a significant adverse effect on airnet s revenues and income 
airnet s contribution margin on the delivery of cancelled checks is significantly higher than its contribution margin from its other delivery services 
the decline in revenues derived from check delivery services and the associated loss of contribution margin will require airnet to further reduce its current route structure and the number of aircraft it operates 
such reductions in airnet s national airline network will result in the elimination of certain delivery services to its banking customers and will result in additional declines in airnet s bank services revenues 
the high fixed costs of airnet s national airline structure will make it difficult to reduce costs in proportion to anticipated decreases in revenues and income 
airnet may be unable to offset losses in its bank services revenues and contribution margins with express services revenues and contribution margins  which could adversely affect airnet s profitability or ability to operate its air transportation network 
because the density of cancelled check shipments is greater than the typical express services shipment  contribution margins on bank services shipments are substantially higher than express services shipments after considering the cubic dimension of shipments 
also  due to the unscheduled nature of express services shipments  pick up and delivery costs per shipment are higher for express services shipments than bank services shipments 
express services contribution margins are currently insufficient to support the operation of airnet s airline as presently configured 
as airnet s bank services revenues decline due to the decrease in cancelled check volumes  it will be necessary for airnet to increase its express services revenues and contribution margins to a level sufficient to support the operating costs of airnet s airline 
in the event airnet is unable to sufficiently increase its express services revenues and contribution margins  it will be necessary to restructure airnet s airline by reducing routes and the number of aircraft its operates 
due to the high fixed costs of operating airnet s national air transportation network  there can be no assurances that airnet s financial performance in future periods will be profitable or sufficient to support a national air transportation network 
reductions in airnet s route schedule and the number of aircraft it operates may adversely impact airnet s express services business 
airnet s air and ground network that provides later pick up and earlier delivery times than those offered by other national carriers is one of the primary differentiating characteristics of airnet s time critical delivery network 
a significant portion of airnet s express services shipments are transported on airnet s airline 
the anticipated decline in airnet s transportation of cancelled checks will require significant changes in airnet s air transportation network  including further reductions in its current route schedule and the number of aircraft it operates 
reductions in airnet s route schedule and the number of aircraft it operates will require airnet to transport a greater portion of its express services shipments on commercial airlines and may adversely impact airnet s ability to expand or maintain its express services business 
competition from other providers of express air and ground delivery services may adversely affect airnet s results of operations and financial condition 
airnet s bank services compete primarily against the federal reserve s check relay network  which has significantly greater financial and other resources than airnet 
the federal reserve is regulated by the monetary control act of  which in general requires that the federal reserve price its services on an actual cost basis plus a set percentage private 
table of contents sector market adjustment factor 
failure by the federal reserve to comply with the monetary control act by pricing its services below the required rates could have an adverse competitive impact on airnet 
in addition  the monetary control act may be amended  modified or repealed  or new legislation affecting airnet s business may be enacted 
also  the market for express services is highly competitive 
aggressive competition for customers with express delivery needs could have a material adverse affect on revenue and contribution margins in express services 
it will be difficult for airnet to dispose of its aircraft and other operating assets in response to any reductions in its air transportation network or operations 
airnet s ability to dispose of its aircraft in response to any reductions in its air transportation network will be limited by the age and cargo configuration of such aircraft 
airnet s aircraft  including its learjets  are relatively older  higher use aircraft that are not configured for passenger use 
lower use learjets with similar ages  lower operating hours and configured for passenger use have been averaging in excess of months on the market prior to sale 
airnet s ability to dispose of its learjets will be restricted by such market factors and may require extended holding periods prior to sale 
the cost of converting such learjets to passenger use will also limit the market for such aircraft and the value airnet would receive upon their sale 
a significant portion of airnet s other aircraft are subject to similar factors that will limit their marketability 
airnet s operating facility located at rickenbacker international airport is a specialty use facility which is not readily adaptable to uses other than aircraft operations 
the specialty nature of airnet s rickenbacker facility and the fact that it is not located at a major metropolitan airport will limit its value and could result in an extended holding period prior to disposition 
government regulation significantly affects airnet 
airnet s delivery operations are subject to various federal  state and local regulations that in many instances require permits and licenses 
failure by airnet to maintain required permits or licenses  or to comply with the applicable regulations  could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of airnet s authority to conduct certain of its operations 
airnet s flight operations are regulated by the faa under part of the federal aviation regulations 
among other things  these regulations govern permissible flight and duty time for aviation flight crews 
the faa has contemplated  from time to time  certain changes in flight and duty time guidelines which  if adopted  could increase airnet s operating costs 
these changes  if adopted  could also require airnet and other operators regulated by the faa to hire additional flight crew personnel 
in addition  congress  from time to time  has considered various means  including excise taxes  to raise revenues directly from the airline industry to pay for air traffic control facilities and personnel 
there can be no assurances that congress will not change the current federal excise tax rate or enact new excise taxes  which could adversely affect airnet s business 
faa grounding of airnet s fleet or a specific type of aircraft used in airnet s delivery services business may adversely affect airnet s business and revenues 
the faa has the authority to ground specific types of aircraft due to safety concerns and ground a part operator s entire fleet for alleged violations of safety requirements 
the faa has  from time to time  grounded specific types of aircraft until such aircraft can be inspected and or can be modified to correct the safety issue 
the faa has considered airworthiness directives that could result in the grounding of certain cessna caravans until de icing equipment or other modifications can be installed 
airnet operates cessna caravans as part of its air transportation network 
the grounding of any type of aircraft used in airnet s fleet  including the cessna caravans  would adversely affect airnet s air transportation network and would adversely affect airnet s business and revenues 
in addition  the cost of modifying airnet s aircraft to correct any safety concerns would increase the cost of operating such aircraft and airnet s business 
loss of airnet management  inc s indirect air carrier standard security program approval could adversely affect airnet s business 
a significant portion of airnet s shipments are transported via commercial passenger airlines 
tsa regulations provide that only indirect air carriers that maintain a tsa approved indirect air carrier standard security program iacssp may tender packages to commercial passenger airlines 
airnet management  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary of airnet airnet management  maintains a tsa approved iacssp under which airnet derives its authority to tender packages to commercial passenger airlines 
airnet s ability to transport packages on commercial passenger airlines is dependent upon airnet management s continuing compliance with the rules and regulations governing indirect air carrier standard security programs and the tsa s continuing approval of the airnet management iacssp 
the tsa has  from time to time  implemented new rules and regulations governing the tender of packages to commercial passenger airlines 
in addition  the us house and senate are considering new legislation which  if enacted  would further increase the regulation of air cargo on commercial passenger aircraft 
such new regulations and legislation could increase airnet s operating costs or make it more difficult to comply with the rules and regulations governing the tender of packages to commercial passenger airlines 
the loss of airnet management s iacssp approval would have a significant and immediate adverse effect on airnet s business 
changes in government regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials may increase airnet s costs of transporting such shipments or reduce airnet s ability to transport such shipments 

table of contents the dot implemented new regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials that went into effect on april  the new regulations required that airnet institute new operating procedures and make arrangements with ground vendors and or fixed based operators to assist airnet in complying with the new regulations 
failure to comply with the new or existing regulations governing the transportation of hazardous materials would reduce or otherwise restrict airnet s ability to transport hazardous materials  including its ability to transport radioactive pharmaceuticals pursuant to airnet s grantee status under the dot sp special permit 
future changes in government regulations regarding the transportation of hazardous materials may also increase airnet s costs of transporting such shipments or reduce airnet s ability to transport such shipments 
reclassification of ground couriers as employees rather than independent contractors could subject airnet to back taxes and other liabilities 
prior to  airnet used the services of independent contractors as couriers to pick up and deliver a significant portion of its packages 
from time to time  federal and state authorities have sought to assert that independent contractors in the transportation industry  including independent contractors providing services similar to those utilized by airnet  are employees rather than independent contractors 
airnet previously classified its couriers providing services under an independent contractor agreement or arrangement as independent contractors rather than as employees 
however  there can be no assurance that federal or state authorities will not challenge this position and attempt to reclassify such independent contractors as employees of airnet 
in the event of any such reclassification  airnet could be required to pay back up withholding with respect to amounts previously paid to its couriers and be required to pay penalties or subject airnet to other liabilities as a result of the incorrect classification of such individuals  such as payment of past due workers compensation and unemployment insurance premiums 
changes to current transportation security requirements or procedures could adversely impact airnet s ability to efficiently conduct airnet s air and ground operations to meet airnet s current delivery parameters or significantly increase costs to transact those operations 
considerable focus has been placed on package security requirements and procedures at domestic and international airports since the september  tragedy and related incidents 
the tsa  commercial airlines  fixed based operations where airnet transacts a significant portion of its aircraft loading and unloading operations and airport authorities are still in the process of reviewing and improving all aspects of their security requirements 
while many proposed changes are voluntary  many are being mandated by the tsa  the dot and the faa 
during  the tsa implemented screening procedures for over the counter cargo tendered to commercial airlines 
these screening procedures have resulted in additional tender time for packages transported on the commercial airlines in certain locations and during certain times 
in addition  the tsa continues to review and consider additional package screening requirements and changes to the vendor screening procedures  which airnet may need to perform on packages from its customers 
many commercial airlines are also adding security surcharges to shipments 
changes at fixed base operators and by local airport authorities could potentially limit airnet s ramp access to its aircraft  thereby increasing tender time from customers 
changes in chain of custody requirements could also potentially cause airnet to incur additional costs to staff additional hours at certain locations 
in response to the new security related procedures being implemented  airnet added a security surcharge in for its bank services and express services customers 
although the surcharge is expected to help offset the increasing costs associated with security issues  airnet s current surcharge program may not be sufficient to cover all new costs it may incur as additional transportation safety procedures are developed and or required 
as a company actively engaged in providing aviation services  airnet is subject to current and future regulations with which it must comply in order to maintain its ability to provide such services 
various governmental agencies are implementing and expanding policies  procedures  and compliance measures to enhance the safety and security of both domestic and international air transportation 
this increasing regulatory environment may require airnet to change its operational processes  modify its flight schedules  and incur additional costs of compliance 
the costs associated with regulatory compliance could impact airnet s financial results 
airnet s inability to comply with current or future governmental regulations could limit or restrict airnet s ability to provide specific services  including but not limited to  the transportation of hazardous materials 
catastrophic accidents involving airnet s aircraft could result in a significant reduction in airnet s business and increase its insurance costs 
a catastrophic accident could reduce the demand for airnet s services and  therefore  reduce its revenue 
in the event of a catastrophic accident  airnet may not be able to secure liability insurance for its business or secure such insurance at a reasonable cost 
environmental concerns may arise in connection with airnet s operation at its rickenbacker facility on leased land with known pollution conditions 

table of contents in  airnet completed construction of its rickenbacker facility on land leased from the authority 
portions of the leased land  as well as portions of the aircraft ramp  on which airnet conducts a significant portion of its operations at the rickenbacker facility  contain known pollution conditions 
the appropriate amended post closure plan and no further action letters addressing these areas were supplied to airnet by the authority prior to beginning construction 
identification of additional pollution conditions on the leased land or attached ramp could increase airnet s costs and have an adverse affect on its ability to operate at the rickenbacker facility 
failure to renew airnet s grantee status to the dot sp special permit or airnet s transport canada permit for equivalent level of safety would result in significant loss of express services revenue 
airnet maintains grantee status to the dot sp special permit and holds a transport canada permit for equivalent level of safety which allows airnet to transport higher volumes of radioactive pharmaceuticals than that permitted by most air carriers 
airnet s grantee status under the dot sp special permit expires in august and its permit for equivalent level of safety expires on march  although airnet anticipates it will obtain a renewal of these permits at their next scheduled renewal dates  there can be no assurances that these permits will be extended 
further  there can be no assurance that airnet can continue to comply with all current requirements related to its grantee status under the dot sp special permit or its permit for equivalent level of safety  or that such requirements will not change in the future which would negatively affect airnet s ability to maintain such status 
anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control of airnet by a third party 
provisions of airnet s amended articles and code of regulations and of the ohio revised code  together or separately  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control of airnet and limit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for the common shares 
among other things  these provisions require certain supermajority votes  establish advance notice procedures for shareholder nomination of candidates for election as directors and for shareholder proposals to be considered at shareholders meetings  eliminate cumulative voting in the election of directors and provide that directors may only be removed from office for cause 
airnet s amended articles authorize the board of directors to issue up to  preferred shares without further shareholder approval  subject to any limitations prescribed by law and the rules and regulations of amex 
the preferred shares could have dividend  liquidation  conversion and other rights and privileges that are superior or senior to the common shares 
issuance of preferred shares could result in the dilution of the voting power of the common shares  adversely affect holders of the common shares in the event of liquidation of airnet or delay  defer or prevent a change in control of airnet 
in addition  section of the ohio revised code contains provisions that require shareholder approval of any proposed control share acquisition of any ohio corporation at any of three voting power thresholds one fifth  one third and a majority 
further  chapter of the ohio revised code contains provisions that restrict specified business combinations and other transactions between an ohio corporation and interested shareholders 
limitations on airnet s ability to borrow could adversely affect airnet s financial condition and prevent airnet from fulfilling its financial obligations 
airnet has a significant revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire on october  airnet s revolving credit facility is used to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements 
any substantial indebtedness incurred under the revolving credit facility could require airnet to dedicate a substantial portion of cash flows from operating activities to payments on airnet s indebtedness  which would reduce the cash flows available to fund working capital  capital expenditures and other general corporate requirements  limit airnet s flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in airnet s business and the industry in which airnet operates  and limit airnet s ability to borrow additional funds 
airnet s liquidity and its ability to meet its current and long term financial obligations as they become due will be dependent upon airnet s financial performance  its ability to meet financial covenants under the revolving credit facility and its ability to replace or extend the revolving credit facility when it becomes due 
airnet s breach of a financial covenant or other provision of its revolving credit facility would constitute a default and would permit its lender to pursue the remedies available to it under the revolving credit facility 
these remedies include terminating airnet s ability to make any new borrowings and accelerating the repayment of all existing borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
if airnet s lender declared a default  there is no assurance that airnet would have adequate resources or be able to obtain other financing to pay amounts owed under the revolving credit facility 
airnet s failure to meet these financial covenants would have a material adverse effect on airnet s financial position and ability to continue operations 
airnet may not be able to raise future capital through debt financing which could adversely affect airnet s ability to execute its express services strategy 
airnet may be unable to raise capital for future capital expenditures through debt financing 
airnet s inability to secure debt financing would limit its ability to purchase new aircraft and change the current mix of aircraft in its fleet 
the current aircraft in airnet s fleet were originally designed to meet the delivery needs of airnet s bank customers and have relatively small 
table of contents cargo capacities 
airnet s current aircraft are not readily adaptable to the transportation of many types of air cargo  which generally require greater aircraft capacity and lower operating costs 
airnet s inability to secure debt financing to purchase aircraft that are more suitable to the transportation of express services cargo may adversely affect airnet s ability to execute its express services strategy of increasing express services revenues and contribution margins 
airnet may encounter issues in documenting and testing its internal control over financial reporting for purposes of complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act of airnet is in the process of documenting and testing its internal control over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  which will require management to annually assess the effectiveness of airnet s internal control over financial reporting beginning with the fiscal year ending december  and a report by airnet s independent registered public accounting firm addressing management s assessment and the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting beginning with the fiscal year ending december  during the course of airnet s testing  airnet may identify deficiencies and weaknesses  which airnet may not be able to remediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the regulations promulgated under the sarbanes oxley act for compliance with the requirements for section if management is unable to conclude that airnet s internal control over financial reporting is effective at year end or airnet s independent registered public accounting firm is unable to give a favorable report on management s assessment beginning with the fiscal year ending december   the result could be a material adverse effect on airnet s reputation  financial condition and on the market price of airnet s common shares

the new port columbus lease expired on august  in connection with vacating its port columbus facility  airnet was required to return certain portions of the premises to their prior condition 
the remedial work required to return the port columbus facility to its prior condition  except for the environmental work discussed below  was completed by december  in connection with the termination of the new port columbus lease  the authority required that airnet conduct an environmental assessment of the port columbus facility  including the underground storage tanks associated with airnet s fuel farm operation 
the objective of the environmental assessment was to determine and quantify any environmental impact airnet s operations may have had at the port columbus facility 
the results of the environmental sampling demonstrated concentrations above the regulatory limits for petroleum hydrocarbons and vinyl chloride in samples associated with one of three oil water separators located in the hanger portion of the port columbus facility 
airnet completed certain remedial work in connection with the pollution conditions in march of through august  airnet also maintained certain assets at port columbus for dispensing aviation fuel under the terms and conditions of a separate lease agreement the fuel farm lease

item legal proceedings in july  airnet received a letter from an attorney representing an association of software publishers indicating that the association had evidence that airnet had engaged in the unlawful installation and use of certain software products 
at the request of the association s attorney  airnet conducted a company wide review of its use of software published by members 
table of contents of the association 
the internal review did not disclose any unauthorized installation or use of such software and the results of the review were submitted to the association s attorney 
the attorney for the association subsequently requested certain supplemental information regarding airnet s software usage  which airnet supplied to the attorney for the association

airnet believes that it is in compliance with all software licensing requirements and that it has not engaged in any unlawful use of the software published by the association s members 
airnet uses the services of independent contractors as couriers to pick up and deliver its packages 
during  the california employment development department the edd concluded an employment tax audit of airnet s operations in california 
as a result of its audit  the edd concluded that certain independent contractors used by airnet should be reclassified as employees 
based upon such reclassification  the edd proposed a  assessment against airnet under section of the california unemployment insurance code
