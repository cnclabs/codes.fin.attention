item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the financial and business analysis below provides information that we believe is relevant to an assessment and understanding of our consolidated financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations 
this financial and business analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item below 
overview blyth is a designer and marketer of home fragrance products and accessories  home d cor  seasonal decorations  household convenience items  personalized gifts and products for the foodservice trade 
we compete in the global home expressions industry  and our products can be found throughout north america  europe and australia 
our financial results are reported in three segments the direct selling segment  the catalog internet segment and the wholesale segment 
these reportable segments are based on similarities in distribution channels  customers and management oversight 
today  annualized net sales are comprised of an approximately million direct selling business  an approximately million catalog internet business and an approximately million wholesale business 
sales and earnings growth differ in each segment depending on geographic location  market penetration  our relative market share and product and marketing execution  among other business factors 
over the long term  all three segments should experience single digit growth  most likely within the low to mid single digit range  again depending on the business factors previously noted 
our current focus is driving sales growth of our brands so we may more fully leverage our infrastructure 
new product development continues to be critical to all three segments of our business 
in the direct selling segment  monthly sales and productivity incentives are designed to attract  retain and increase the earnings opportunity of independent sales consultants 
in the catalog and internet channel  product  merchandising and circulation strategy are designed to drive strong sales growth in newer brands and expand further the sales and customer base of our flagship brands 
in the wholesale segment  sales initiatives are targeted to independent retailers and national accounts 
recent developments in september  we announced our proposed intention to spin off the wholesale segment 
we requested and received from the internal revenue service a ruling on the tax free status for the transaction 
in march  we announced our intention to evaluate additional strategic opportunities that had been identified since the announcement of the spin off  which would likely focus on one or more of our european wholesale businesses  believing that substantial upside opportunities exist in the north american wholesale businesses despite challenging market conditions impacting the home expressions industry 
in accordance with this intention to explore strategic alternatives with respect to our european wholesale businesses  a on april   we sold kaemingk bv kaemingk to an entity controlled by the management of this business  b on june   we sold edelman bv edelman and euro decor b 
v 
euro decor to an entity with which members of the management of edelman and euro decor are affiliated  c on august   we sold the gies group and d on december   we sold colony gifts corporation ltd

net sales direct selling segment net sales in the direct selling segment decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal partylite s us sales decreased approximately compared to prior year 
management believes this sales decrease was driven by a decline in the number of sales consultants as a result of increased channel competition  as well as fewer shows per consultant

net sales in the wholesale segment represented approximately of total blyth sales in fiscal compared to in fiscal blyth s consolidated gross profit decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the gross profit margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease from prior year is principally due to lower partylite us sales  restructuring charges of million in the wholesale segment and million in the direct selling segment and higher commodity costs 
blyth s consolidated selling expense decreased million  or approximately  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in selling expense relates to the reduced sales in the us direct selling and mass candle businesses  along with tighter cost controls in many business units  partially offset by restructuring charges in the wholesale and direct selling segment 
selling expense as a percentage of net sales increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in selling expense as a percent of sales is a result of sales decreasing at a greater rate than selling expenses 
blyth consolidated administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in administrative expenses versus the prior year was primarily due to non recurring expenses related to the proposed spin off of the wholesale segment and the loss on sale of impact plastics of million included in fiscal additionally  in fiscal the company collected million for a note receivable which had been reserved for as part of the gies sale 
administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were approximately for both fiscal and fiscal goodwill impairment charges of million and million were recognized in the wholesale segment in fiscal and  respectively 
the charge in fiscal was the result of a substantial decline in the operating performance of the reporting units when compared to prior years results and budgeted expectations 
the amount recorded in fiscal was the result of the company s decision to discontinue the sales of a new product  rising commodity costs and a continued decline in operating performance in the sterno reporting unit  and a business restructuring resulted in a significantly changed near term outlook of the business in the wholesale premium reporting unit 
the charges incurred in fiscal included the write off of the remaining goodwill balances within the wholesale segment see critical accounting policies and note of the consolidated financial statements

interest income and other increased million from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to increased interest income earned on higher amounts of cash and short term investments 
income tax expense decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this decrease in income tax expense was primarily due to the decrease in us earnings versus higher foreign sourced earnings  which are taxed at a lower rate than u 
s earnings and the income tax expense of million recorded in fiscal related to the ajca dividend which did not recur in fiscal this decrease was offset by the recording of income taxes on unremitted foreign earnings  the tax impact of non deductible goodwill impairments  and an increase in the company s contingent tax reserve

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  restructuring and impairments and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
revenue recognition revenues consist of sales to customers  net of returns and allowances 
the company recognizes revenue upon delivery  when both title and risk of loss are transferred to the customer 
generally  sales orders are received via signed customer purchase orders with stated fixed prices based on published price lists 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs  which may include special pricing agreements for specific customers  volume incentives and other promotions 
should market conditions decline  the company may increase customer incentives with respect to future sales 
the company also records reductions to revenue  based primarily on historical experience  for estimated customer returns and chargebacks that may arise as a result of shipping errors  product damage in transit or for other reasons that can only become known subsequent to recognizing the revenue 
if the amount of actual customer returns and chargebacks were to increase significantly from the estimated amount  revisions to the estimated allowance would be required 
in some instances  the company receives payment in advance of product delivery 
such advance payments occur primarily in our direct selling and direct marketing channels and are recorded as deferred revenue 
upon delivery of product for which advance payment has been made  the related deferred revenue is reclassified to revenue 
most of the company s sales made on credit are made to an established list of customers 
although the collectibility of sales made on credit is reasonably assured  the company has established an allowance for doubtful accounts for its trade and note receivables 
the allowance is determined based on the company s evaluation of specific customers ability to pay  aging of receivables  historical experience and the current economic environment 
while the company believes it has appropriately considered known or expected outcomes  its customers ability to pay their obligations  including those to the company  could be adversely affected by declining sales at retail resulting from such factors as contraction in the economy or a general decline in consumer spending 
some of the company s business units offer seasonal dating programs pursuant to which customers that qualify for such programs are offered extended payment terms for seasonal product shipments 
as with other customers  customer orders pursuant to such seasonal dating programs are generally received in the form of a written purchase order signed by an authorized representative of the customer 
sales made pursuant to seasonal dating programs are recorded as revenue only upon delivery either to the customer or to an agent of the customer depending on the freight terms for the particular shipment and consistent with the concept of risk of loss 
the sales price for the company s products sold pursuant to such seasonal dating programs is fixed prior to the time of shipment to the customer 
customers do not have the right to return product except for rights to return that the company believes are typical of our industry for such reasons as damaged goods  shipping errors or similar occurrences 
the company is not required to repurchase products from its customers  nor does the company have any regular practice of doing so 
the company believes that it is reasonably assured of payment for products sold pursuant to such seasonal dating programs based on its historical experience with the established list of customers eligible for such programs 
in addition  the company minimizes its exposure to bad debts by utilizing established credit limits for each customer 
if  however  product sales by our customers during the seasonal selling period should fall significantly below expectations  such customers financial condition could be adversely affected  increasing the risk of not collecting these seasonal dating receivables and  possibly  resulting in additional bad debt charges 
the company does not make any sales under consignment or similar arrangements 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined by the first in  first out method 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  market conditions  customer planograms and sales forecasts 
if market acceptance of our existing products or the successful introduction of new products should significantly decrease  additional inventory write downs could be required 
potential additional inventory write downs could result from unanticipated additional quantities of obsolete finished goods and raw materials  and or from lower disposition values offered by the parties who normally purchase surplus inventories 
as a result of the restructuring of our north american mass channel home fragrance business see note to the consolidated financial statements inventory write downs totaling million were recorded in cost of good sold during fiscal at january   the company had obsolete inventory reserves totaling approximately million 
restructuring and impairment charges on long lived assets in response to changing market conditions and competition  the company s management regularly updates its business model and market strategies  including the evaluation of facilities  personnel and products 
future adverse changes in economic and market conditions could result in additional organizational changes and possibly additional restructuring and impairment charges 
the company recorded approximately million of charges related to the restructuring of our north american mass channel home fragrance business during fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements  of which million was recorded in cost of goods sold and million was recorded in administrative expense 
these charges relate to the closing of our tijuana  mexico manufacturing facility  the elimination of less profitable customers  the elimination of stock keeping units from our product line  outsourcing of certain products currently being manufactured and personnel reductions 
also  during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded approximately million of charges related to the restructuring of the north american operations of our direct selling segment in recognition of the recent decline in sales in this channel 
these costs were comprised of a million charge to cost of goods sold for lease obligations and equipment impairments related to a reduction in seasonal distribution capacity and million of severance costs 
of the million of severance costs  million was recorded in cost of goods sold and million was recorded in selling and administrative expense 
the company recorded approximately a million impairment charge related to equipment in its north american wholesale manufacturing facility  which is included in cost of goods sold in the fiscal financial statements 
the company did not record any restructuring and impairment charges in fiscal historically  the company has reviewed long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment and other intangibles with definite lives for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying amount of such an asset might not be recoverable 
management determines whether there has been a permanent impairment on long lived assets held for use in the business by comparing anticipated undiscounted future cash flow from the use and eventual disposition of the asset or asset group  to the carrying value of the asset 
the amount of any resulting impairment is calculated by comparing the carrying value to the fair value  which may be estimated using the present value of the same cash flows 
long lived assets that meet the definition of held for sale are valued at the lower of carrying amount or net realizable value 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles goodwill and other indefinite lived intangibles are subject to an assessment for impairment using a two step fair value based test and such other intangibles are also subject to impairment reviews  which must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that goodwill or other indefinite lived intangibles might be impaired 
the company performs its annual assessment of impairment as of january  which is our fiscal year end date 
for goodwill  the first step is to identify whether a potential impairment exists 
this is done by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying amount  including goodwill 
fair value for each of our reporting units is estimated utilizing a combination of valuation techniques  namely the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology 
the fair value of the reporting units is derived by calculating the average of the outcome of the two valuation techniques 
the discounted cash flow methodology assumes the fair value of an asset can be estimated by the economic benefit or net cash flows the asset will generate over the life of the asset  discounted to its present value 
the discounting process uses a rate of return that accounts for both the time value of money and the investment risk factors 
the market multiple methodology estimates fair value based on what other participants in the market have recently paid for reasonably similar assets 
adjustments are made to compensate for differences between the reasonably similar assets and the assets being valued 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  no further analysis is necessary 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the second step is performed 
the second step compares the carrying amount of the goodwill to the estimated fair value of the goodwill 
if fair value is less than the carrying amount  an impairment loss is reported as a reduction to goodwill and a charge to operating expense 
our assumptions in the discounted cash flow methodology used to support recoverability include the reporting unit s five year business outlook 
the business outlook is a five year projection of the business unit s financial performance 
the business outlook includes the cash generated from the reporting unit and certain assumptions for revenue growth  capital spending and profit margins 
this serves as the basis for the discounted cash flow model in determining fair value 
additionally  the discount rate utilized in the cash flow model values the reporting unit to its net present value taking into consideration the time value of money  other investment risk factors and the terminal value of the business 
for the terminal value  we used a multiple of earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiplied by a certain factor for which an independent third party would pay for a similar business in an arms length transaction 
in determining this factor we used information that was available for similar transactions executed in the marketplace 
the multiple of ebitda used contemplates among other things the expected revenue growth of the business which in turn would require the use of a higher ebitda multiple if revenue were expected to grow at a higher rate than normal 
the following circumstances could impact the company s cash flow and cause further impairments to reported goodwill unexpected increase in competition resulting in lower prices or lower volumes  entry of new products into the marketplace from competitors  lack of acceptance of the company s new products into the marketplace  loss of key employee or customer  significantly higher raw material costs  and macro economic factors wholesale premium as a result of the company s annual assessment of impairment in fiscal  the company determined that the goodwill balance existing at its wholesale premium reporting unit within the wholesale segment was impaired 
in fiscal  the wholesale premium reporting unit experienced a substantial decline in operating performance when compared to prior years results and budgeted fiscal expectations 
therefore  the company recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million for the wholesale premium reporting unit within the wholesale segment 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company identified a triggering event  which caused us to reassess goodwill impairment for its wholesale premium reporting unit within the wholesale segment 
in the wholesale premium reporting unit  a business restructuring resulted in a significantly reduced near term outlook for the businesses that gives effect to the changing business environment which led the company to perform an impairment analysis of the goodwill in this reporting unit 
as a result of this analysis  the goodwill in this reporting unit was determined to be impaired  as the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill 
the decrease in the fair value of this reporting unit was due to a significant decrease in the projected results for the full fiscal year and future years as a result of the factors previously discussed 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was determined utilizing a combination of valuation techniques  namely the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal writing off the remaining goodwill balance of the wholesale premium reporting unit in the wholesale segment 
the table below is a summary of estimated fair values as of january  and july  and the assumptions used in comparison to the carrying values in assessing recoverability for the company s wholesale premium reporting unit of the wholesale segment as of january  january  july  s in millions estimated fair value recorded carrying value of assets excess impaired value to recorded value assumptions and other information discount rate average revenue growth rate tax rate terminal multiple of ebitda capital expenditures goodwill at risk other long lived assets at risk as a result of the reduced near term outlook and the changing business environment discussed above  the discount rate was increased from to and the terminal multiple of ebitda was reduced from to the changes in these assumptions reflect the continued changes in the business environment and adverse business conditions currently experienced 
management believes the adverse conditions currently being experienced are not temporary but reflect the additional risk in the marketplace as a result of additional pricing pressures and competition 
sterno as a result of the company s annual impairment analyses in fiscal  the company determined that the goodwill balance existing at its sterno reporting unit in the wholesale segment was impaired 
in fiscal  the sterno reporting unit experienced a substantial decline in operating performance when compared to prior years results and budgeted fiscal expectations 
therefore  the company recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the sterno reporting unit of the wholesale segment 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company identified a triggering event  which caused us to reassess the goodwill of the sterno reporting unit for impairment 
in the sterno reporting unit  the company s decision to discontinue sales of a new product line coupled with sharply rising commodity costs led the company to perform an impairment analysis of goodwill in the reporting unit 
as a result of this analysis  the goodwill in this reporting unit was determined to be impaired  as the fair value of the reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill 
the decrease in the fair value of the reporting unit was due to a significant decrease in the projected results for the full fiscal year and future years as a result of the factors previously discussed 
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was determined utilizing a combination of valuation techniques  namely the discounted cash flow methodology and the market multiple methodology 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal in the wholesale segment 
in the second half of fiscal  the sterno reporting unit within the wholesale segment experienced a further decline in operating performance when compared to prior years results and budgeted fiscal expectations 
as a result of the fiscal goodwill impairment assessment the company recorded a non cash pre tax goodwill impairment charge of million writing off the remaining goodwill balance of the sterno reporting unit within the wholesale segment 
the table below is a summary of estimated fair values as of january   july  and january  and the assumptions used in comparison to the carrying values in assessing recoverability for the company s sterno reporting unit of the wholesale segment whose fair value was close to its carrying value as of january  and june  january  july  january  s in millions estimated fair value recorded carrying value of assets excess impaired value to recorded value assumptions and other information discount rate average revenue growth rate tax rate terminal multiple of ebitda annual capital expenditures goodwill at risk other long lived assets at risk miles kimball the table below is a summary of estimated fair values as of january  and and the assumptions used in comparison to the carrying values in assessing recoverability for the company s miles kimball reporting unit of the catalog internet segment whose fair value was close to its carrying value as of january  and s in millions estimated fair value recorded carrying value of assets excess impaired value to recorded value assumptions and other information discount rate average revenue growth rate tax rate terminal multiple of ebitda capital expenditures goodwill at risk other long lived assets at risk other in august  the company acquired a interest in boca java  a small gourmet coffee and tea company 
boca java sells its products primarily through the internet and is included in the company s catalog internet segment 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company has determined that boca java represents a separate reporting unit and thus must be reviewed for impairment on a stand alone basis 
the company has completed the january  impairment assessment  which indicated that the goodwill of million is fully recoverable 
boca java is a relatively new operation  which is dependant upon achieving high revenue growth and other operating objectives as well as the continued support and funding from its parent 
should boca java fail to meet its revenue and operating objectives or fail to receive the continued support of its parent  its goodwill could be subject to a partial or full impairment 
the company s direct selling segment has approximately million of goodwill 
the january  impairment assessment of this segment indicates that the goodwill is fully recoverable 
the direct selling segment currently generates a significant amount of cash flows therefore the estimated fair value exceeds its carrying value by a wide margin 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company sold its european seasonal and everyday decorations businesses  kaemingk  edelman and euro decor  in the first half of fiscal  which resulted in a reduction in goodwill attributable to these businesses totaling million 
if actual revenue growth  profit margins  costs and capital spending should differ significantly from the assumptions included in our business outlook used in the cash flow models the reporting unit s fair value could fall significantly below expectations and additional impairment charges could be required to write down goodwill to its fair value and if necessary other long lived assets could be subject to a similar fair value test and possible impairment 
long lived assets represent primarily fixed assets and other long term assets excluding goodwill and other intangibles 
there are two main assumptions that are used for the discounted cash flow analysis first  the discount rate and second the terminal multiple 
this discount rate is used to value the gross cash flows expected to be derived from the business to its net present value 
the discount rate uses a rate of return to account for the time value of money and an investment risk factor 
for the terminal multiple  we used earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda multiplied by a certain factor for which an independent third party would pay for a similar business in an arms length transaction 
in determining this factor we used information that was available for similar transactions executed in the marketplace 
the multiple of ebitda used contemplates among other things  the expected revenue growth of the business which in turn would require the use of a higher ebitda multiple if revenue were expected to grow at a higher rate than normal 
a change in the discount rate is often used by management to alter or temper the discounted cash flow model if there is a higher degree of risk that the business outlook objectives might not be achieved 
these risks are often based upon the business units past performance  competition  confidence in the business unit management  position in the marketplace  acceptance of new products in the marketplace and other macro and micro economic factors surrounding the business 
if management feels there is additional risk associated with the business outlook it will adjust the discount rate and terminal value accordingly 
the terminal value is generally a multiple of ebitda and is discounted to its net present value using the discount rate 
capital expenditures are included and are consistent with the historical business trend plus any known significant expenditures 
if the outlook for the miles kimball reporting unit as of january  was to be less optimistic than we had assumed in our valuation model  whereby we increased the discount rate by and decreased the terminal multiple by one  the fair value of the miles kimball reporting unit would have decreased by million 
this reduction in fair value would not have caused the company to perform a step two test for impairment as the fair value of the business would still exceed its carrying value 
conversely  if the outlook for the miles kimball reporting unit as of january  was more optimistic than we had assumed in our valuation model  whereby we decreased the discount rate by and increased the terminal multiple by one  the fair value of the miles kimball reporting unit catalog internet segment would have increased by million 
trade names and trademarks the company s trade name and trademark intangible assets relate to the company s acquisitions of miles kimball and walter drake in fiscal and are reported in the company s catalog internet segment 
the company has approximately million in trade names and trademarks as of january   whose fair value was determined at the dates of acquisition 
the fair value of these trade names and trademarks as of january  was million 
the company performs its annual assessment of impairment for indefinite lived intangible assets as of january  which is our fiscal year end 
the company uses the relief from royalty method to estimate the fair value for indefinite lived intangible assets 
the underlying concept of the relief from royalty method is that the inherent economic value of intangibles is directly related to the timing of future cash flows associated with the intangible asset 
similar to the income approach or discounted cash flow methodology used to determine the fair value of goodwill  the fair value of indefinite lived intangible assets is equal to the present value of after tax cash flows associated with the intangible asset based on an applicable royalty rate 
the royalty rate is determined by using existing market comparables for royalty agreements using an intellectual property data base 
the arms length agreements generally support a rate that is a percentage of direct sales 
this approach is based on the premise that the free cash flow is a more valid criterion for measuring value than book or accounting profits 
the two primary assumptions used in the relief from royalty method are the discount rate and the royalty rate 
this discount rate is used to value the expected net cash flows to be derived from the royalty to its net present value 
the discount rate uses a rate of return to account for the time value of money and an investment risk factor 
the royalty rate is based upon past royalty performance as well as the expected royalty growth rate using both macro and micro economic factors surrounding the business 
a change in the discount rate is often used by management to alter or temper the discounted cash flow analysis if there is a higher degree of risk that the estimated cash flows from the indefinite lived intangible asset may not be fully achieved 
these risks are often based upon the business units past performance  competition  position in the marketplace  acceptance of new products in the marketplace and other macro and micro economic factors surrounding the business 
if  however  actual cash flows should fall significantly below expectations this could result in an impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets 
if as of january   the discount rate would have increased and the royalty rate would have decreased by  respectively  the fair value of the catalog internet trade names and trademarks would have decreased by million to million 
this decrease would have required the company to take an impairment charge of million to write down its indefinite lived intangibles to its estimated fair value 
conversely  if the discount rate would have decreased and the royalty rate would have increased by  respectively  the fair value of the catalog internet trade names and trademarks would have increased by million to million 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure state  federal and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings 
the management of the company periodically estimates the probable tax obligations of the company using historical experience in tax jurisdictions and informed judgments 
there are inherent uncertainties related to the interpretation of tax regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company transacts business 
the judgments and estimates made at a point in time may change based on the outcome of tax audits  as well as changes to or further interpretations of regulations 
if such changes take place  there is a risk that the tax rate may increase or decrease in any period 
amounts accrued for the potential tax assessments  primarily recorded in long term liabilities total million and million at january  and  respectively 
accruals relate to tax issues for us federal  domestic state and taxation of foreign earnings 
as of january   the company  in accordance with apb opinion  accounting for income taxes  special areas  determined that million of undistributed foreign earnings were not reinvested indefinitely by its non us subsidiaries 
deferred income tax expense of million was recorded as a reduction to the company s net income on these undistributed earnings 
the company periodically determines whether the non us subsidiaries will invest their undistributed earnings indefinitely and reassesses this determination as appropriate

the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
the company hedged the net assets of certain of its foreign operations through foreign currency forward contracts during fiscal the company did not continue to hedge the net assets of its foreign operations during fiscal the net after tax gain related to the derivative net investment hedge instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss oci totaled million at january  the company has designated its forward exchange and options contracts on forecasted intercompany purchases and future purchase commitments as cash flow hedges and  as such  as long as the hedge remains effective and the underlying transaction remains probable  the effective portion of the changes in the fair value of these contracts will be recorded in oci until earnings are affected by the variability of the cash flows being hedged 
with regard to commitments for inventory purchases  upon payment of each commitment  the underlying forward contract is closed and the corresponding gain or loss is transferred from accumulated oci and is included in the measurement of the cost of the acquired asset 
if a hedging instrument is sold or terminated prior to maturity  gains and losses are deferred in accumulated oci until the hedged item is settled 
however  if the hedged item is no longer likely to occur  the resultant gain or loss on the terminated hedge is recognized into earnings immediately 
amounts included in accumulated oci at january  are immaterial and are expected to be transferred into earnings within the next twelve months upon payment of the underlying commitment 
the company has designated its foreign currency forward contracts related to intercompany loans and intercompany payables as fair value hedges 
the gains or losses on the fair value hedges are recognized into earnings and generally offset the transaction gains or losses in the foreign denominated loans that they are intended to hedge 
for consolidated financial statement presentation  net cash flows from such hedges are classified in the categories of the consolidated statement of cash flows with the items being hedged
