item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation critical accounting policies and estimates each contained within this annual report on form k 
if we are not able to attract and retain top employees  our ability to compete may be harmed our performance is substantially dependent on the performance of our executive officers and key employees 
the loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could significantly harm our business 
we do not maintain key person life insurance policies on any of our employees 
our success is also highly dependent on our continuing ability to identify  hire  train  retain and motivate highly qualified management  technical  sales and marketing personnel 
in particular  the recruitment of top research developers and experienced salespeople remains critical to our success 
competition for such people is intense  substantial and continuous  and we may not be able to attract  integrate or retain highly qualified technical  sales or managerial personnel in the future 
in addition  in our effort to attract and retain critical personnel  we may experience increased compensation costs that are not offset by either improved productivity or higher prices for our products or services 
our awards of stock options to employees may have an adverse impact on our operations a portion of our total compensation program for our executive officers and key personnel includes the award of options to buy our common shares 
if the price of our common shares performs poorly  such performance may adversely affect our ability to retain or attract critical personnel 
in addition  any changes made to our stock option policies  or to any other of our compensation practices  which are made necessary by governmental regulations or competitive pressures could affect our ability to retain and motivate existing personnel and recruit new personnel 
the length of our sales cycle can fluctuate significantly which could result in significant fluctuations in license revenue being recognized from quarter to quarter the decision by a customer to purchase our products often involves a comprehensive implementation process across our customer s network or networks 
as a result  licenses of these products may entail a significant commitment of resources by prospective customers  accompanied by the attendant risks and delays frequently associated with significant expenditures and lengthy sales cycle and implementation procedures 
given the significant investment and commitment of resources required by an organization to implement our software  our sales cycle may be longer compared to companies in other industries 
over the past fiscal year  we have experienced a lengthening of our sales cycle as customers include more personnel in their decisions and focus on more enterprise wide licensing deals 
in an economic environment of reduced information technology spending  it may take several months  or even several quarters  for marketing opportunities to materialize 
if a customer s decision to license our software is delayed or if the installation of our products takes longer than originally anticipated  the date on which we may recognize revenue from these licenses would be delayed 
such delays could cause our revenues to be lower than expected in a particular period 

table of contents our international operations expose us to business risks that could cause our operating results to suffer we intend to continue to make efforts to increase our international operations and anticipate that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenue 
we have increased our presence in the european market  especially since our acquisition of ixos software ag ixos 
these international operations are subject to certain risks and costs  including the difficulty and expense of administering business and compliance abroad  compliance with domestic and foreign laws including without limitation domestic and international import and export laws and regulations  costs related to localizing products for foreign markets  and costs related to translating and distributing products in a timely manner 
international operations also tend to be subject to a longer sales and collection cycle 
in addition  regulatory limitations regarding the repatriation of earnings may adversely affect the transfer of cash earned from foreign operations 
significant international sales may also expose us to greater risk from political and economic instability  unexpected changes in canadian  united states or other governmental policies concerning import and export of goods and technology  regulatory requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers 
additionally  international earnings may be subject to taxation by more than one jurisdiction  which may materially adversely affect our effective tax rate 
also  international expansion may be more difficult  time consuming  and costly 
as a result  if revenues from international operations do not offset the expenses of establishing and maintaining foreign operations  our operating results will suffer 
moreover  in any given quarter  foreign exchange rates may adversely affect our revenue  earnings or other financial measures 
our expenses may not match anticipated revenues we incur operating expenses based upon anticipated revenue trends 
since a high percentage of these expenses are relatively fixed  a delay in recognizing revenue from transactions related to these expenses could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter and  as a result  such a delay could materially reduce operating income 
if these expenses are not subsequently followed by revenues  our business  financial condition  or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  in july  we announced our restructuring initiative to restructure our operations with the intention of streamlining our operations 
subsequently  in october we announced our commitment to a separate restructuring initiative in response to the hummingbird acquisition 
we may incur costs associated with combining hummingbird s operations with our own operations beyond those costs contemplated in the hummingbird restructuring initiative  which may be substantial 
some of these restructuring costs may have to be treated as expenses which would decrease our net income and earnings per share for the periods in which those adjustments are made 
we will continue to evaluate our operations  and may propose future restructuring actions as a result of changes in the marketplace  including the exit from less profitable operations or the decision to terminate services which are not valued by our customers 
any failure to successfully execute these initiatives on a timely basis may have a material adverse impact on our operations 
our products may contain defects that could harm our reputation  be costly to correct  delay revenues  and expose us to litigation our products are highly complex and sophisticated and  from time to time  may contain design defects or software errors that are difficult to detect and correct 
errors may be found in new software products or improvements to existing products after commencement of shipments to our customers 
if these defects are discovered  we may not be able to successfully correct such errors in a timely manner 
in addition  despite the extensive tests we conduct on all our products  we may not be able to fully simulate the environment in which our products will operate and  as a result  we may be unable to adequately detect the design defects or software errors which may become apparent only after the products are installed in an end user s network 
the occurrence of errors and failures in our products could result in the delay or the denial of market acceptance of our products  alleviating such errors and failures may require us to make significant expenditure of our resources 
the harm to our reputation resulting from product errors and failures may be materially damaging 
since we regularly provide a warranty with our products  the financial impact of fulfilling warranty obligations may be significant in the future 
our agreements with our strategic partners and end users typically contain provisions designed to limit 
table of contents our exposure to claims 
these agreements usually contain terms such as the exclusion of all implied warranties and the limitation of the availability of consequential or incidental damages 
however  such provisions may not effectively protect us against claims and the attendant liabilities and costs associated with such claims 
although we maintain errors and omissions insurance coverage and comprehensive liability insurance coverage  such coverage may not be adequate to cover all such claims 
accordingly  any such claim could negatively affect our financial condition 
failure to protect our intellectual property could harm our ability to compete effectively we are highly dependent on our ability to protect our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of copyright  patent  trademark and trade secret laws  as well as non disclosure agreements and other contractual provisions to establish and maintain our proprietary rights 
although we hold certain patents and have other patents pending  our general strategy is to not seek patent protection 
we intend to protect our rights vigorously  however  there can be no assurance that these measures will  in all cases  be successful 
enforcement of our intellectual property rights may be difficult  particularly in some nations outside of north america in which we seek to market our products 
while us and canadian copyright laws  international conventions and international treaties may provide meaningful protection against unauthorized duplication of software  the laws of some foreign jurisdictions may not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of canada or of the united states 
the absence of harmonized intellectual property laws makes it more difficult to ensure consistent respect for our proprietary rights 
software piracy has been  and is expected to be  a persistent problem for the software industry  and piracy of our products represents a loss of revenue to us 
certain of our license arrangements have required us to make a limited confidential disclosure of portions of the source code for our products  or to place such source code into an escrow for the protection of another party 
despite the precautions we have taken  unauthorized third parties  including our competitors  may be able to i copy certain portions of our products  or ii reverse engineer or obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
also  our competitors could independently develop technologies that are perceived to be substantially equivalent or superior to our technologies 
our competitive position may be adversely affected by our possible inability to effectively protect our intellectual property 
other companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property  which could materially increase costs and materially harm our ability to generate future revenue and profits claims of infringement are becoming increasingly common as the software industry develops and as related legal protections  including patents  are applied to software products 
although we do not believe that our products infringe on the rights of third parties  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future 
although most of our technology is proprietary in nature  we do include certain third party software in our products 
in these cases  this software is licensed from the entity holding our intellectual property rights 
although we believe that we have secured proper licenses for all third party software that is integrated into our products  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future 
any such assertion may result in litigation or may require us to obtain a license for the intellectual property rights of third parties 
such licenses may not be available  or they may not be available on reasonable terms 
in addition  such litigation could be disruptive to our ability to generate revenue and may result in significantly increased costs as a result of our defense against those claims or our attempt to license the patents or rework our products to ensure they comply with judicial decisions 
any of the foregoing could have a significant adverse impact on our ability to generate future revenue and profits 
the loss of licenses to use third party software or the lack of support or enhancement of such software could adversely affect our business we currently depend upon a limited number of third party software products 
if such software products were not available  we may experience delays or increased costs in the development of licenses for our products 
for a limited number of product modules  we rely on software products that we license from third parties  
table of contents including software that is integrated with internally developed software and which is used in our products to perform key functions 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  and the related software may not continue to be appropriately supported  maintained  or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss by us of the license to use  or the inability by licensors to support  maintain  and enhance any of such software  could result in increased costs or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software is developed or licensed and integrated with internally developed software 
such increased costs or delays or reductions in product shipments could adversely affect our business 
a reduction in the number or sales efforts by distributors could materially impact our revenues a significant portion of our revenue is derived from the license of our products through third parties 
our success will depend  in part  upon our ability to maintain access to existing channels of distribution and to gain access to new channels if and when they develop 
we may not be able to retain a sufficient number of our existing distributors or develop a sufficient number of future distributors 
distributors may also give higher priority to the sale of products other than ours which could include competitors products or may not devote sufficient resources to marketing our products 
the performance of third party distributors is largely outside of our control and we are unable to predict the extent to which these distributors will be successful in marketing and licensing our products 
a reduction in sales efforts  a decline in the number of distributors  or a decision by our distributors to discontinue the sale of our products could materially reduce revenue 
our products rely on the stability of infrastructure software that  if not stable  could negatively impact the effectiveness of our products  resulting in harm to our reputation and business our developments of internet and intranet applications depend and will depend on the stability  functionality and scalability of the infrastructure software of the underlying intranet  such as the infrastructure software produced by sun microsystems  inc  hewlett packard company  oracle  microsoft and others 
if weaknesses in such infrastructure software exist  we may not be able to correct or compensate for such weaknesses 
if we are unable to address weaknesses resulting from problems in the infrastructure software such that our products do not meet customer needs or expectations  our reputation  and consequently  our business may be significantly harmed 
business disruptions may adversely affect our operations our business and operations are highly automated and a disruption or failure of our systems may delay our ability to complete sales and to provide services 
a major disaster or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations 
this possible disruption may materially and adversely affect our future operating results 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to fluctuate which could materially impact the price of our common shares we experience  and we are likely to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in quarterly revenues and operating results caused by many factors  including changes in the demand for our products and for the products of our competitors  the introduction or enhancement of products by us and by our competitors  market acceptance of enhancements or products  delays in the introduction of products or enhancements by us or by our competitors  customer order deferrals in anticipation of upgrades and new products  changes in the lengths of sales cycles  
table of contents changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  delays in product installation with customers  the mix of distribution channels through which products are licensed  the mix of products and services sold  the mix of international and north american revenues  foreign currency exchange rates  acquisitions  the timing of restructuring charges taken in connection with any completed acquisition  general economic and business conditions  and general political developments  such as international trade policies and the war on terrorism 
a general weakening of the global economy  or economic or business uncertainty created by north american or international political developments  could cancel or delay customer purchases 
a cancellation or deferral of even a small number of licenses or delays in the installation of our products could have a material adverse effect on our operations in any particular quarter 
as a result of the timing of product introductions and the rapid evolution of our business as well as of the markets we serve  we cannot predict whether seasonal patterns experienced in the past will continue 
for these reasons  you should not rely upon period to period comparisons of our financial results to forecast future performance 
our quarterly revenue and operating results may vary significantly and this possible variance could materially reduce the market price of our common shares 
the volatility of our stock price could lead to losses by shareholders the market price of our common shares has been subject to wide fluctuations 
such fluctuations in market price may continue in response to i quarterly variations in operating results  ii announcements of technological innovations or new products that are relevant to our industry  iii changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  or iv other events or factors 
in addition  financial markets experience significant price and volume fluctuations that particularly affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies 
these fluctuations have often resulted from the failure of such companies to meet market expectations in a particular quarter  and thus such fluctuations may or may not be related to the underlying operating performance of such companies 
broad market fluctuations or any failure of our operating results in a particular quarter to meet market expectations may adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
occasionally  periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities may lead to the institution of securities class action litigation against a company 
due to the volatility of our stock price  we may be the target of such securities litigation in the future 
such legal action could result in substantial costs to defend our interests and a diversion of management s attention and resources  each of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we may become involved in litigation that may materially adversely affect us from time to time in the ordinary course of our business  we may become involved in various legal proceedings  including commercial  product liability  employment  class action and other litigation and claims  as well as governmental and other regulatory investigations and proceedings 
such matters can be time consuming  divert management s attention and resources and cause us to incur significant expenses 
furthermore  because litigation is inherently unpredictable  the results of any such actions may have a material adverse effect on our business  operations or financial condition 

table of contents we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities we are subject to income and other taxes in a variety of jurisdictions and our tax structure is subject to review by both domestic and foreign taxation authorities 
the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and of other tax liabilities requires significant judgment 
although we believe our estimates are reasonable  the ultimate outcome with respect to the taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements  and this difference may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made

fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal milestones fiscal was a successful year for us 
in october we acquired a competitor  hummingbird ltd hummingbird 
other significant milestones of fiscal were as follows total revenue increased by on a year over year basis to million 
license revenue increased to million equivalent to a increase over fiscal increase in operating cash flows of million over fiscal  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal increase in the overall cash balance by million over fiscal  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal long term bank borrowing of million including a non scheduled prepayment of million 
announcement  in may  of a share repurchase program to repurchase up to a maximum of million open text shares over a one year period 
market launch  in november  of livelink ecm the newest addition to our ecm suite of products 
unveiling  in february  of an integrated product roadmap and the details of our next generation ecm offering code named dmx which represents a convergence of open text and hummingbird technologies 
release of livelink ecm edocs version which is a product that will allow hummingbird customers to deploy and leverage the capabilities of windows vista and microsoft office 
a significant operational restructuring initiative commenced in the second quarter of fiscal  of both our operations and legacy hummingbird operations with a view to achieving long term operational efficiencies and cost savings from economies of scale 

table of contents acquisitions we have a history of both organic and acquisitive growth and a robust and dynamic acquisition program is an integral part of our corporate strategy 
in fiscal we made the following two acquisitions in october  we completed the acquisition of hummingbird  a toronto based  global provider of ecm solutions in an all cash deal for million net of cash acquired 
we see significant synergies in this acquisition and believe that this acquisition will enhance our size and global reach and will further solidify our position as a leading provider of ecm solutions 
we believe the union of open text and hummingbird will strengthen our ability to reach a wider  more diversified audience  create a strong strategic fit that adds to our solutions focus  and will increase the reach of our global partner program in march  we acquired momentum systems inc momentum for million in cash net of cash acquired 
momentum  based in arlington  virginia  has served the government sector for over years and has had a successful track record of implementing and supporting our livelink ecm solutions 
we believe this acquisition will further enhance our ability to sell to and service the government sector 
partners we have developed strong and mutually beneficial relationships with key technology partners  including major software vendors  systems integrators  and storage vendors  to deliver customer focused solutions 
key alliances of open text include oracle  microsoft  sap  deloitte  accenture and hitachi 
we rely on close cooperation with partners for sales and product development  as well as for the optimization of opportunities which arise in our competitive environment 
we continue to make significant progress with our global partner program  with emphasis on developing strategic relations and tight integration with partners 
business generated through areas like archiving  records management and compliance continue to be driven through our partners 
our revenue from partners contributed to approximately of our revenues in fiscal compared to approximately in fiscal in fiscal we announced a worldwide reselling agreement with sap for open text brand archiving and document access products 
also  we announced two new product offerings with microsoft the first being an office business application built upon microsoft office and the second being a product particular to the legal industry that combines our legal industry expertise in life cycle and proactive compliance management with the collaboration and document management capabilities of microsoft office sharepoint server 
outlook for fiscal the consensus of ecm industry analysts is that the ecm market will grow in the to range and we see our license revenue growing in and around the same range 
we see e mail archiving and records management products as being the main drivers of the ecm market and we expect that our traditional customer base will continue to build upon existing ecm applications 
we expect to launch our dmx product in the second quarter of fiscal our partnership with sap will continue to be a significant strategic initiative for us in fiscal  enabling us to access new markets 
we anticipate new opportunities for growth in the ecm market  particularly around records management and compliance as well as increased demand for sharepoint and sap integration 
we believe that the market will continue to consolidate and that such consolidation will help us on the competitive front 
we also expect to continue to pay down our long term debt and expect to make a second prepayment of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal 
table of contents overall  our focus for fiscal will be to continue growing license revenue  improve profitability  and expand on business opportunities created by our partner initiatives 
results of operations as a result of our acquisition of hummingbird  we have included the financial results of hummingbird in our consolidated financial statements beginning october   the date we acquired of the issued and outstanding shares of hummingbird 
the fluctuations in the operating results in the current periods  compared with the same period in the prior fiscal year  are generally due to the synergies generated by this acquisition 
immediately upon the acquisition of hummingbird  we restructured both hummingbird and pre acquisition open text operations into one combined organization 
sales forces were aligned by either a combined vertical or within a given geography 
all back office functions such as accounting and information technology were consolidated to manage the combined operations 
our research and development teams quickly prepared integration code to combine products and features between previous hummingbird and open text products 
most former hummingbird executive management and many next levels of management personnel were terminated and primarily open text management assumed all responsibilities for sales  service  research and development  and general and administrative activities 
in view of the shared resources  single line management and combined operations  presentation of the results of operations of open text and hummingbird separately is  we believe  not meaningful and therefore not articulated within this discussion and analysis 
the following table presents an overview of our results of operations in thousands change from fiscal total revenue cost of revenue gross profit amortization of acquired intangible assets special charges recoveries other operating expenses income from operations gross margin operating margin net income 
table of contents an analysis of our results of operations follows revenues revenue and by product type and geography the following tables set forth our revenues by product  revenue as a percentage of the related product revenue and revenue by major geography for each of the periods indicated revenue by product type in thousands change from fiscal license customer support services total of total revenue revenue mix license customer support services total revenue by geography in thousands north america europe other total of total revenue north america europe other total license revenue license revenue consists of fees earned from the licensing of software products to customers 
license revenue increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as the result of growth from our european operations and the accretive impact of hummingbird 
of the total growth achieved in fiscal  europe accounted for of the increase on account of higher partner involvement  followed by north america  which added and the other segment contributed approximately of the overall growth in license revenue 
additionally  partner generated license sales contributed to approximately of license revenue compared to only in fiscal 
table of contents customer support revenue customer support revenue consists of revenue from our customer support and maintenance agreements 
these agreements allow our customers to receive technical support  enhancements and upgrades to new versions of our software products when and if available 
customer support revenue is generated from such support and maintenance agreements relating to current year sales of software products and from the renewal of existing maintenance agreements for software licenses sold in prior periods 
as our installed base grows  the renewal rate has a larger influence on customer support revenue than the current software revenue growth 
therefore changes in customer support revenue do not necessarily correlate directly to the changes in license revenue in a given period 
typically the term of these support and maintenance agreements is twelve months  with customer renewal options 
we have historically experienced a renewal rate over but continue to encounter pricing pressure from our customers during contract negotiation and renewal 
new license sales create additional customer support agreements which contribute substantially to the increase in our customer support revenue 
customer support revenue increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as the result of growth from our north american operations and the accretive impact of hummingbird 
of the total growth achieved in fiscal  north america accounted for of the increase  followed by europe  which contributed and the other segment provided for the remaining growth in customer support revenue 
service revenue service revenue consists of revenues from consulting contracts and contracts to provide training and integration services 
service revenue increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal  primarily as the result of growth from our european operations and the accretive impact of hummingbird 
of the total growth achieved in fiscal  europe accounted for of the increase  followed by north america  which added and the remaining other segment contributed to the rest of the overall growth in service revenue 
revenue mix our overall revenue mix  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  is consistent with our expectations 
for fiscal we expect to see the following revenue mix of total revenue license to customer support to services to cost of revenue and gross margin by product type the following tables set forth the changes in cost of revenues and gross margin by product type for the periods indicated in thousands change from fiscal license customer support service amortization of acquired technology intangible assets total 
table of contents gross margin license customer support service cost of license revenue cost of license revenue consists primarily of royalties payable to third parties and product media duplication  instruction manuals and packaging expenses 
cost of license revenue increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a direct correlation to the total increase in license revenues for fiscal due to  primarily  higher product distribution costs of million

cost of customer support revenues cost of customer support revenues is comprised primarily of technical support personnel and related costs

the most significant component of these costs is personnel related expenses 
the other components include travel costs and third party subcontracting

a discussion of the significant items that impacted special charges in fiscal follows fiscal restructuring plan in december  in the immediate aftermath of the hummingbird acquisition  we commenced restructuring activities to streamline the operations of the legacy open text activities 
this involved primarily work force reductions and consolidation of excess facilities 
this is separate  in accounting terms  from the initiative to restructure legacy hummingbird activities discussed in the liquidity and capital resources section 
in fiscal we incurred a total cash outlay of million relating to this plan and expect the remaining accrual to be substantially expended in the first half of fiscal we do not expect to record any significant accretions to the fiscal plan in fiscal 
table of contents accretion of acquisition related facility accrual in june  based upon our review of our estimates of our future sub lease income  which are embedded in our estimate of accruals for excess facility obligations  we reduced our original estimate for future sub lease income relating to an excess facility we acquired as part of the ixos acquisition 
the subject facility is a relatively large facility located outside munich  germany  in a town called grassbrunn  measuring approximately  square metres 
the relatively large size severely impacted our ability to further sub lease the facility and in combination with a real estate vacancy rate in grassbrunn of compared to in the greater munich area caused us to review the original estimate of the sub lease income critically 
in accordance with the accounting rules relating to accounting for acquisitions  the original acquisition related accrual for this facility was reduced by an estimate for future sub lease income 
these rules also require that any accretions to the original estimate  occurring one year after the date of the acquisition  be charged to operating expenses in the period in which such accretions are determined 
as the ixos acquisition occurred in march  we have  accordingly  included an amount of million within special charges on account of the revision of our original estimate of sub lease income 
in addition to the above mentioned factors the additional trigger events that caused us to increase the estimate of accrual and reduce the estimate of sub lease income were as follows the time remaining to lease the facility the lease for this facility expires on march  the necessary timeframe to complete a sublet transaction  regardless of its size  can be anywhere between twelve to thirty six months including contract negotiation  construction of leasehold improvements and moving before any sub let revenue is realized and consequently the relatively short timeframe remaining between today and march is adversely affecting our ability to attract sub tenants 
during fiscal  we changed our marketing strategy  in this regard  to find tenants willing to take any size of space  not just tenants willing to take full floors or the entire facility 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal we implemented a potential additional change to our sub tenant marketing strategy in that we would be willing to consider not just parceling out the property to smaller sub tenants as indicated above but also  the possibility of reducing the sub rental rates further 
based upon the above factors  and an analysis of the relative probability of various potential sub lease scenarios that could occur  our best estimate of the potential impact of the reduction in the original estimate of sub lease income was determined to be million 
since we are now outside the one year allocation period within which one may adjust or amend acquisition related accruals  the million was charged to the operating expenses of fiscal we will review this estimate on a quarterly basis and either accrete or reduce the accrual as necessary during fiscal and up to the end of the lease in march impairment of intangible assets during the year ended june  and  impairment charges of  and million  respectively  were recorded relating to a write down of certain intellectual property in north america 
the intellectual property represents the fair value of acquired technology from the corechange acquisition which closed in the fiscal year 
the triggering event that gave rise to the impairments was a shift in the marketing and development strategy associated with the intellectual property and our assessment of the acquired technology relative to its product lifecycle 
the impairments were measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the discounted projected future net cash flows 

table of contents net interest expense net interest expense increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was predominantly due to the interest expense incurred on the new long term debt acquired during fiscal to partially finance the hummingbird acquisition 
in fiscal we expect interest expense to be approximately to be in the range of million to million 
income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million in fiscal compared to million during fiscal this equates to an effective tax rate of in fiscal versus an effective tax rate of in fiscal the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal versus the preceding fiscal year is in part due to higher taxable income in jurisdictions with a tax rate lower than the canadian statutory rate and in part due to the use of deferred tax assets which had a valuation allowance recorded against it in the prior year 
our deferred tax assets totaling million are based upon available income tax losses and future income tax deductions 
our ability to use these income tax losses and future income tax deductions is dependent upon us generating income in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arose 
the recognized deferred tax liability of million is primarily made up of four components 
the first component relates to the net addition of the deferred tax liability associated with hummingbird s identifiable intangible assets of million 
the second component relates to million arising from other acquired identifiable intangible assets 
the third component of million relates primarily to deferred credits arising from non capital losses and undeducted scientific research and development experimental expenditures acquired at a discount on asset acquisitions  which will be included in income as they are utilized 
the fourth component of million relates to deferred tax liability arising from investment tax credits 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
based on the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  the character of the income tax asset and tax planning strategies  we have determined that a valuation allowance of million is required in respect of our deferred income tax assets as at june  a valuation allowance of million was required for the deferred income tax assets as at june  
this valuation allowance is primarily attributable to valuation allowances set up based on losses incurred in the current and prior years 
in order to fully utilize the recognized deferred income tax assets of million  we will need to generate aggregate future taxable income in applicable jurisdictions of approximately million 
based on our current projection of taxable income for the periods in the jurisdictions in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible  it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the recognized deferred income tax assets as of june  quarterly overview the following table summarizes selected unaudited quarterly financial data for the past eight fiscal quarters fiscal fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter in thousands  except per share data total revenues gross profit net income earnings per share basic diluted 
table of contents fiscal fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter in thousands  except per share data total revenues gross profit net income loss earnings loss per share basic diluted quarterly revenues and expenses are impacted by a number of external factors including the timing of large transactions  timing of budget approvals of our customers  acquisitions  seasonality of economic activity and to some degree the timing of capital spend by our customers 
the strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal was due to the impact of two sales transaction exceeding million  one transaction exceeding million and the overall favorable impact of the integration of hummingbird 
liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the changes in our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows over the periods indicated in thousands june  june  increase decrease in cash cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to a higher net income of million  the favorable impact of non cash adjustments of approximately million and a net increase in operating assets and liabilities of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to payments made for the hummingbird acquisition  in fiscal  in the amount of million  purchase of momentum for million  payments for acquisition related accruals of million  offset by reduced spending on capital assets as part of our planned effort to reduce capital expenditures  of million and other miscellaneous reductions in investing activities 
in accordance with the accounting rules for setting up acquisition related accruals  we set up accruals in the amount of million relating to an exit plan for workforce reductions of legacy hummingbird employees and abandonment of legacy hummingbird facilities 
during fiscal we made cash payments of approximately million relating to these accruals 
we expect to make the balance of the payments except those relating the excess facilities before the end of the first half of fiscal 
table of contents net cash provided by financing activities net cash provided by financing increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a net increase in long term debt of million  and proceeds from the issuance of shares under our stock option and employee share purchase plans of million 
the increase was offset by million of debt issuance costs 
the increase in long term debt is on account of a seven year debt facility obtained from a canadian chartered bank in the amount of million against which we incurred million of debt issuance costs discussed in more detail later in this discussion and analysis 
long term debt and credit facilities on october   we entered into a million credit agreement the credit agreement with a canadian chartered bank the bank consisting of a million term loan facility the term loan and a million committed revolving long term credit facility the revolver 
the term loan was used to partially finance the hummingbird acquisition and the revolver will be used for general business purposes 
the credit agreement is guaranteed by us and certain of our subsidiaries 
term loan the term loan has a seven year term and expires on october  and bears interest at a floating rate of libor plus 
the term loan principal repayments are equal to of the original principal amount  due each quarter with the remainder due at the end of the term  less ratable reductions for any prepayments made 
in may  we repaid million of the principal  which had the effect of reducing the quarterly principal payment to approximately  in fiscal we expect to make an additional prepayment in the amount of million on this term loan 
we are in compliance with all loan covenants relating to this facility as of june  to limit our exposure to the floating rate portion of the interest rate on the term loan  we entered into a three year interest rate collar that had the economic effect of circumscribing the floating portion of our interest rate obligations associated with million of the term loan within an upper limit of and a lower limit of 
revolver the revolver has a five year term and expires on october  borrowings under this facility bear interest at rates specified in the credit agreement 
the revolver replaced a cad million line of credit the old line of credit that we previously had with the bank 
we had no balances outstanding under the old line of credit at the date of termination 
the revolver is subject to a stand by fee ranging between and per annum 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolver as of june  and we did not borrow any amounts under this facility in fiscal outlook for fiscal we will use any excess cash remaining after meeting operational requirements for one or more of the following purposes repayment of long term debt re purchase of our shares acquiring of other companies 
table of contents we currently own a building in toronto  canada acquired as part of the acquisition of hummingbird  which we have classified as an asset held for sale 
although we cannot determine the eventual selling price or the timing of the sale  we are actively marketing the property and expect to sell the building during fiscal as of june  the fair value of the building was million 
we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents including without limitation the net cash provided by operating activities  the net cash used in investing activities and the net cash provided by financing activities  available credit facilities and committed loan facilities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  contractual commitments and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
we do not expect to pay any dividends in fiscal commitments and contractual obligations we have entered into the following contractual obligations with minimum annual payments for the indicated fiscal periods as follows payments due by fiscal year ended june  total to to and beyond long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations net of million of non cancelable sub lease income we are to receive from properties which we have sub leased to other parties

litigation from time to time  we are subject to legal proceedings and claims  either asserted or unasserted  that arise in the ordinary course of business 
while the outcome of these proceedings and claims cannot be predicted with certainty  our management does not believe that the outcome of any of these legal matters will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not enter into off balance sheet financing as a matter of practice except for the use of operating leases for office space  computer equipment  and vehicles

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap necessarily requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we re evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenues  bad debts  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed at the time to be reasonable under the circumstances 
under different assumptions or conditions  the actual results will differ  potentially materially  from those previously estimated 
many of the conditions impacting these assumptions and estimates are outside of our control 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve significant judgment and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires a judgment or accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain  and if different estimates that could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
management has discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements business combinations we account for acquisitions of companies in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
we allocate the purchase price to tangible assets  intangible assets and liabilities based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition with the excess of purchase price  if any  being allocated to goodwill 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment and disposition of long lived assets in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
we test long lived assets or asset groups  such as capital assets and definite lived intangible assets  for recoverability when events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amount may not be recoverable 
circumstances which could trigger a review include  but are not limited to significant adverse changes in the business climate or legal factors  current period cash flow or operating losses combined with a history of losses or a forecast of continuing losses associated with the use of the asset  and a current expectation that the asset will more likely than not be sold or disposed of before the end of its estimated useful life 
recoverability is assessed based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the aggregate pre tax undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset or asset group 
impairment is recognized when the carrying amount is not recoverable and exceeds the fair value of the asset or 
table of contents asset group 
the impairment loss  if any  is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds discounted projected future cash flows 
we recorded an impairment charge of  during the year ended june  million  june  
see note special charges recoveries under item to this annual report on this form k 
acquired intangibles this category consists of acquired technology and contractual relationships associated with various acquisitions  as well as trademarks and patents 
acquired technology is initially recorded at fair value based on the present value of the estimated net future income producing capabilities of software products acquired on acquisitions 
acquired technology is amortized over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
contractual relationships represent relationships that we have with certain customers on contractual or legal rights and are considered separable 
we acquired these contractual relationships through business combinations and they were initially recorded at their fair value based on the present value of expected future cash flows 
contractual relationships are amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives 
we continually evaluate the remaining useful life of our intangible assets being amortized to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining period of amortization 
goodwill fasb sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires that goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives be tested for impairment annually or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in accordance with sfas  we do not amortize goodwill 
we performed  in accordance with sfas  our annual impairment analysis of goodwill as of april  the analysis in all years indicated that there was no impairment of goodwill in any of the reporting units 
if estimates change  a materially different impairment conclusion could result 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make payments 
we evaluate the credit worthiness of our customers prior to order fulfillment and based on these evaluations  adjust credit limits to the respective customers 
in addition to these evaluations  we conduct on going credit evaluations of our customers payment history and current credit worthiness 
the allowance is maintained for of all accounts deemed to be uncollectible and  for those receivables not specifically identified as uncollectible  an allowance is maintained for a specific percentage of those receivables based upon the aging of accounts  our historical collection experience and current economic expectations 
to date  the actual losses have been within management expectations 
no single customer accounted for more than of the accounts receivable balance as of june  and revenue recognition a license revenues we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa in october as amended by sop issued in december 
table of contents we record product revenue from software licenses and products when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software product has been shipped  there are no significant uncertainties surrounding product acceptance  the fees are fixed and determinable and collection is considered probable 
we use the residual method to recognize revenue on delivered elements when a license agreement includes one or more elements to be delivered at a future date if evidence of the fair value of all undelivered elements exists 
if an undelivered element for the arrangement exists under the license arrangement  revenue related to the undelivered element is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered element 
our multiple element sales arrangements include arrangements where software licenses and the associated post contract customer support pcs are sold together 
we have established vsoe of the fair value of the undelivered pcs element based on the contracted price for renewal pcs included in the original multiple element sales arrangement  as substantiated by contractual terms and our significant pcs renewal experience  from our existing worldwide base 
our multiple element sales arrangements generally include rights for the customer to renew pcs after the bundled term ends 
these rights are irrevocable to the customer s benefit  are for specified prices and the customer is not subject to any economic or other penalty for failure to renew 
further  the renewal pcs options are for services comparable to the bundled pcs and cover similar terms 
it is our experience that customers generally exercise their renewal pcs option 
in the renewal transaction  pcs is sold on a stand alone basis to the licensees one year or more after the original multiple element sales arrangement 
the renewal pcs price is consistent with the renewal price in the original multiple element sales arrangement although an adjustment to reflect consumer price changes is not uncommon 
if vsoe of fair value does not exist for all undelivered elements  all revenue is deferred until sufficient evidence exists or all elements have been delivered 
we assess whether payment terms are customary or extended in accordance with normal practice relative to the market in which the sale is occurring 
our sales arrangements generally include standard payment terms 
these terms effectively relate to all customers  products  and arrangements regardless of customer type  product mix or arrangement size 
the only time exceptions are made to these standard terms is on certain sales in parts of the world where local practice differs 
in these jurisdictions  our customary payment terms are in line with local practice 
b service revenues service revenues consist of revenues from consulting  implementation  training and integration services 
these services are set forth separately in the contractual arrangements such that the total price of the customer arrangement is expected to vary as a result of the inclusion or exclusion of these services 
for those contracts where the services are not essential to the functionality of any other element of the transaction  we determine vsoe of fair value for these services based upon normal pricing and discounting practices for these services when sold separately 
these consulting and implementation services contracts are primarily time and materials based contracts that are  on average  less than six months in length 
revenue from these services is recognized at the time such services are rendered as the time is incurred by us 
we also enter into contracts that are primarily fixed fee arrangements wherein the services are not essential to the functionality of a software element 
in such cases the proportional performance method is applied to recognize revenue 
revenues from training and integration services are recognized in the period in which these services are performed 

table of contents c customer support revenues customer support revenues consist of revenue derived from contracts to provide pcs to license holders 
these revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the contract 
advance billings of pcs are not recorded to the extent that the term of the pcs has not commenced or payment has not been received 
research and development costs research and development costs internally incurred in creating computer software to be sold  licensed or otherwise marketed  are expensed as incurred unless they meet the criteria for deferral and amortization  described in fasb sfas no 
accounting for the costs of corporate software to be sold  released  or otherwise marketed sfas 
in accordance with sfas  costs related to research  design and development of products are charged to expenses as incurred and capitalized between the dates that the product is considered to be technologically feasible and is considered to be ready for general release to customers 
in our historical experience  the dates relating to the achievement of technological feasibility and general release of the product have substantially coincided 
in addition  no significant costs are incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility 
as a result we do not capitalize any research and development costs relating to internally developed software to be sold  licensed or otherwise marketed 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the consolidated financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years 
these temporary differences are measured using enacted tax rates 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the extent that management considers it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in determining the valuation allowance  management considers factors such as the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected taxable income  and the character of income tax assets and tax planning strategies 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated valuation allowance and income tax expense 
in addition  we are subject to examinations by taxation authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate in the normal course of operations 
we regularly assess the status of these examinations and the potential for adverse outcomes to determine the adequacy of the provision for income and other taxes 
restructuring charges we record restructuring charges relating to contractual lease obligations and other exit costs in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires recognition of costs associated with an exit or disposal activity when the liability is incurred and can be measured at fair value 
we record restructuring charges relating to employee termination costs in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for post employment benefits sfas 
sfas applies to post employment benefits provided to employees under on going benefit arrangements 
in accordance with sfas  we record such charges when the termination benefits are capable of being determined or estimated in advance  from either the provisions of our policy or from past practices  the benefits are attributable to services already rendered and the obligation relates to rights that vest or accumulate 
the recognition of restructuring charges requires management to make certain judgments regarding the nature  timing and amount associated with the planned restructuring activities  including estimating sub lease 
table of contents income and the net recoverable amount of equipment to be disposed of 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the appropriateness of the remaining accrued balances 
litigation we are a party  from time to time  in legal proceedings 
in these cases  management assesses the likelihood that a loss will result  as well as the amount of such loss and the financial statements provide for our best estimate of such losses in accordance with fasb sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies to the extent that any of these legal proceedings are resolved and the result is that we are required to pay an amount in excess of what has been provided for in the financial statements  we would be required to record  against earnings  such excess at that time 
if the resolution resulted in a gain to us  or a loss less than that provided for  such gain is recognized when received or receivable 
share based compensation on july   we adopted the fair value based method for measurement and cost recognition of employee share based compensation under the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised share based payments sfas r  using the modified prospective transitional method 
previously  we had been accounting for employee share based compensation using the intrinsic value method  which generally did not result in any compensation cost being recorded for stock options since the exercise price was equal to the market price of the underlying shares on the date of grant 
our stock options are now accounted for under sfas r 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
for the year ended june   the weighted average fair value of options granted  as of the grant date  was  using the following weighted average assumptions expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yield of  and expected life of years 
a forfeiture rate of  based on historical employee turnover rates  was used to determine the net amount of compensation expense recognized 
for the year ended june   the weighted average fair value of options granted  as of the grant date  was  using the following weighted average assumptions expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yield of  and expected life of years 
a forfeiture rate of  based on historical employee turnover rates  was used to determine the net amount of compensation expense recognized 
for the year ended june   the weighted average fair value of options granted  as of the grant date  during the periods was  using the following weighted average assumptions expected volatility of  risk free interest rate of  expected dividend yield of  and expected life of years 
share based compensation cost included in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended june  was million 
deferred tax assets of  were recorded  as of june  in relation to the tax effect of certain stock options that are eligible for a tax deduction when exercised 
we have not capitalized any share based compensation costs as part of the cost of an asset 
share based compensation cost included in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended june  was approximately million 
deferred tax assets of  were recorded  as of june  in relation to the tax effect of certain stock options that are eligible for a tax deduction when exercised 
we have not capitalized any share based compensation costs as part of the cost of an asset 
we made no modifications to the terms of our outstanding share options in anticipation of the adoption of sfas r 
also  we made no changes in either the quantity or type of instruments used in our share option plans or the terms of our share option plans 

table of contents in order to calculate the fair value of share based payment awards  we use the black scholes model 
this model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including stock price volatility  the expected exercise behavior and forfeiture rate 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the expected life of options granted is based on historical experience and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option are determined by the us treasury yields and the government of canada benchmark bond yields for us dollar and canadian dollar options  respectively  in effect at the time of the grant 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent our best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change or we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
we are also required to estimate the forfeiture rate and only recognize the expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  our share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the period such determination is made

under fin  an entity should presume that a taxing authority will examine a tax position when evaluating its position for recognition 
table of contents and measurement  therefore  assessment of the probability of the risk of examination is not appropriate 
in applying the provisions of fin  there will be distinct recognition and measurement evaluations 
fin will be effective for us in our first quarter of fiscal we are currently assessing the potential impact that the adoption of fin will have on our financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal results of operations the following table presents an overview of our selected financial data 
in thousands change from fiscal total revenue cost of revenue gross profit amortization of acquired intangible assets special charges recoveries   n a other operating expenses income from operations gross margin operating margin net income our focus in fiscal was on increasing near term profitability by streamlining our operations 
to achieve this we announced a significant restructuring of our operations in july which resulted in a charge of million 
this restructuring primarily included work force reductions and abandonment of excess real estate facilities 
absent the impact of this charge our operational income was million in fiscal which was a substantial improvement over our operational income absent the impact of a restructuring recovery in fiscal  which was million 
in addition  we rationalized our product portfolio and made significant progress with our global partner program  particularly with microsoft  oracle and sap 
we received microsoft s global isv independent software vendor of the year award and launched a program with oracle which will include the joint selling of oracle and open text products 
revenue by product type the following tables set forth our revenues by product and as a percentage of the related product revenue for the periods indicated in thousands change from fiscal license customer support services total of total revenue license customer support services total 
table of contents license revenue license revenue decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the drop was primarily due to structural re alignment of certain sales forces around the world  which decreased license revenue by approximately million  as we continued to focus on streamlining our operations and to focus on future profitability 
this decrease was offset by improved results in north america  where license revenue increased by approximately million compared with fiscal we believe the increased license revenue in north america was the result of a greater demand in north america for our ecm and sap solutions 
the remaining decrease in license revenue is attributable to a negative foreign exchange impact of million 
customer support revenue customer support revenue increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal all geographic regions contributed to the increase in customer support revenue from fiscal to fiscal service revenue service revenue remained relatively stable in fiscal increasing slightly by million compared to fiscal service revenue was strong in north america  however it was offset by a weakening in europe when compared to fiscal cost of revenue and gross margin by product type the following tables set forth the changes in cost of revenues and gross margin by product type for the periods indicated in thousands change from fiscal license customer support service amortization of acquired technology acquired intangible total gross margin license customer support service cost of license revenue cost of license revenues decreased in fiscal as our license revenues decreased  but the gross margin on licenses has remained stable over fiscal and fiscal due to the fact that our overall cost structure has remained relatively unchanged

table of contents cost of service revenues cost of service revenues increased by million in fiscal versus fiscal due to higher direct marketing costs offset by reduced professional services and training costs 
cost of service revenues as a percentage of service revenues remained stable at in fiscal compared to in fiscal amortization of acquired technology intangible assets amortization of acquired technology intangible assets increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the increase is due to the full year impact of the amortization of intangibles relating to our fiscal acquisitions 
operating expenses the following table sets forth total operating expenses by function and as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated in thousands change from fiscal research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of acquired intangible assets special charges recoveries   n a total in of total revenue research and development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation amortization of acquired intangible assets special charges recoveries research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to a favorable reduction of labour expenses of million owing to a reduction of headcount in fiscal  a reduction in overhead expenses of million and recoverable input tax credits of million offset by share based payment expenses of million 
the remaining decrease was the result of savings from miscellaneous expenses 
sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses declined by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this decline relates primarily to a million reduction of labour costs attributable to a reduction of headcount in fiscal  a reduction of million in marketing expenses  a reduction of million in overhead allocations offset by an increase of million of share based payment expenses and the rest due to miscellaneous increases in costs 

table of contents general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales have remained stable over both fiscal and fiscal these expenses increased marginally in absolute dollar terms as a result of a decrease in consulting and compliance related costs offset partially by an increase due to stock compensation expenses 
depreciation expenses depreciation expenses increased marginally in fiscal over fiscal due to additions in capital assets relating primarily to the addition of the waterloo building and computer equipment 
amortization of acquired intangible assets the million increase in amortization in fiscal over fiscal is due to the full year impact of the amortization of intangibles relating to our fiscal acquisitions 
special charges recoveries the following table sets forth the details of special charges in thousands fiscal restructuring plan fiscal restructuring plan impairment of acquired technology intangible assets impairment of acquired capital assets total for more details on special charges  see note special charges recoveries to the notes to consolidated financial statements under item of this annual report on form k 
a discussion of the significant items that impacted special charges in fiscal is as follows fiscal restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal  we commenced the implementation of a restructuring plan to streamline operations and consolidate excess facilities 
in fiscal we incurred a cash outlay of million relating to this plan 
impairment of capital assets we recorded million of capital asset write downs in fiscal relating primarily to write downs of leasehold improvements located in premises that were vacated on account of the fiscal restructuring plan 
income taxes we recorded a tax provision of million in fiscal compared to million during fiscal and million in fiscal this equates to an effective tax rate of in fiscal versus an effective tax rate of and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate in fiscal versus the two preceding fiscal years is due to the fact that the corresponding tax benefit had not been realized on losses that resulted from our fiscal restructuring charge 

table of contents our deferred tax assets totaling million are based upon available income tax losses and future income tax deductions 
our ability to use these income tax losses and future income tax deductions is dependent upon us generating income in the tax jurisdictions in which such losses or deductions arose 
the recognized deferred tax liability of million is primarily made up of three components 
the first component relates to million arising from the amortization of timing differences relating to acquired intangible assets and future income inclusions 
the second component of million relates primarily to deferred credits arising from non capital losses and undeducted scientific research and development experimental expenditures acquired at a discount on asset acquisitions  which will be included in taxable income as they are utilized 
the third component of million relates to deferred tax liability arising from investment tax credits 
we record a valuation allowance against deferred income tax assets when we believe it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
based on the reversal of deferred income tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  the character of the income tax asset and tax planning strategies  we have determined that a valuation allowance of million is required in respect to our deferred income tax assets as at june  a valuation allowance of million was required for the deferred income tax assets as at june  
this valuation allowance is primarily attributable to valuation allowances set up based on losses incurred in the year in certain foreign jurisdictions 
in order to fully utilize the recognized deferred income tax assets of million  we will need to generate aggregate future taxable income in applicable jurisdictions of approximately million 
based on our current projection of taxable income for the periods in the jurisdictions in which the deferred income tax assets are deductible  it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit of the recognized deferred income tax assets as of june  liquidity and capital resources the following table summarizes the changes in our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows over the periods indicated in thousands june  june  change in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal as a result of an increase in non cash adjustments of approximately million and an increase in operating assets and liabilities of approximately million 
the increase in net cash provided by operating activities was offset by a decrease in net income of approximately million 
net cash used in investing activities net cash used in investing activities decreased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal the overall decrease in investing expenditures was primarily due to the fact that we did not make any business acquisitions in fiscal which represented approximately million in spending in fiscal and our acquisition related costs were lower by million 
in addition  we also spent million less in fiscal than fiscal purchasing ixos and gauss shares 
these savings in investment were offset by our increased capital spending of million  million on prior period acquisitions and an investment of million in shares of hummingbird 

table of contents net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash provided by financing increased by approximately million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily due to the fact that we did not repurchase any of our common shares in fiscal  which represented million in spending in fiscal and as a result of the mortgage financing we secured on our waterloo building  which represented approximately million in fiscal in fiscal we secured a demand operating facility of cdn million with a canadian chartered bank 
borrowings under this facility bear interest at varying rates depending upon the nature of the borrowing 
we have pledged certain of our assets as collateral for this demand operating facility 
there are no stand by fees for this facility 
as of june   there were no borrowings outstanding under this facility 
we anticipate that our cash and cash equivalents  available credit facilities and committed loan facilities will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements for working capital  contractual commitments and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
commitments and contractual obligations we have entered into the following contractual obligations with minimum annual payments for the indicated fiscal periods as follows payments due by fiscal year ended june  total to and beyond long term debt obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations net of million of non cancelable sub lease income we are to receive from properties which we have sub leased to other parties 
rental expense of million  million and million was recorded during the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are primarily exposed to market risks associated with fluctuations in interest rates on our term loan and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate fluctuations relates primarily to our term loan  as we had no borrowings outstanding under our line of credit at june  as of june  we had an outstanding balance of million on this loan 
the term loan bears a floating interest rate of libor plus 
as of june   an adverse change in libor of basis points would have the effect of increasing our annual interest payment on the term loan by approximately million assuming the loan balance as of june  is outstanding for the entire period 
we manage our interest rate exposure  relating to million of the above mentioned term loan  with an interest rate collar that partially hedges the fluctuation in libor 
the collar has a notional value of million  a cap rate of and a floor rate of 
this has the effect of circumscribing our maximum floating interest rate risk within the range of to 
the collar expires in december 
table of contents foreign currency risk a substantial portion of our cash and cash equivalents are held in currencies other than the us dollar  on account of our global operations 
as of june   this balance represented approximately of our total cash and cash equivalents 
a adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar would have decreased our reported cash and cash equivalents by approximately 
our global operations expose us to foreign currency fluctuations 
revenues and related expenses generated from our international subsidiaries are generally denominated in the functional currencies of the local countries 
our primary currencies include euros  canadian dollars  swiss francs and british pounds 
the consolidated statements of income of our global operations are translated into us dollars at the average exchange rates in each applicable period 
to the extent the us dollar strengthens against foreign currencies  the foreign currency conversion of these foreign currency denominated transactions into us dollars results in reduced revenues  operating expenses and net income for our international operations 
similarly  our revenues  operating expenses and net income will increase for our international operations  if the us dollar weakens against foreign currencies 
we cannot predict the effect foreign exchange fluctuations will have on our results going forward 
however  if there is an adverse change in foreign exchange rates versus the us dollar  it could have a material effect on our results of operations
