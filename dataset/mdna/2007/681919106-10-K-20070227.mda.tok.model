our clients consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy  our agencies serve similar clients  in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients  across a variety of geographic regions and locations 
our clients participate in virtually all industry sectors of the global economy 
furthermore  in many cases  our agencies or networks serve different product groups within the same clients served by other omnicom agencies or networks 
for example  our largest client was served by more than of our agencies in and represented of our consolidated revenue 
no other client accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue 
each of our top clients was served  on average  by more than of our agencies in and represented of our consolidated revenue 
our employees at december   we employed approximately  people 
we are not party to any significant collective bargaining agreements 
the skill sets of our workforce across our agencies and within each discipline are similar 
common to all is the ability to understand a client s brand  its selling proposition and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand to the client s target audience 
recognizing the importance of this core competency  we have established tailored training and education programs for our service professionals around this competency

risk factors companies periodically review and change their advertising  marketing and corporate communications services business models and relationships 
if we are unable to remain competitive or retain key clients  our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 
the businesses in which we participate are highly competitive 
key competitive considerations for retaining existing business and winning new business include our ability to develop creative solutions that meet client needs  the quality and effectiveness of the services we offer  and our ability to efficiently serve clients  particularly large international clients  on a broad geographic basis 
while many of our client relationships are long standing  companies put their advertising  marketing and corporate communications services business up for competitive review from time to time 
we have won and lost accounts in the past as a result of these reviews 
to the extent that we are not able to remain competitive  our revenue may be adversely affected  which could then affect our results of operations and financial condition 
government regulations and consumer advocates may limit the scope of the content of our services  which could affect our ability to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
government agencies and consumer groups have directly or indirectly from time to time affected or attempted to affect the scope  content and manner of presentation of advertising  marketing and corporate communications services  whether through regulations or other governmental actions 
any such limitations on the scope of the content of our services could affect our ability to meet our clients needs  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  there has been an increasing tendency on the part of businesses to resort to the judicial system to challenge advertising practices 
we cannot assure investors that such claims by businesses or governmental agencies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition in the future 
the success of our acquiring and retaining clients depends on our ability to avoid and manage conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships and retention of key personnel 
our ability to retain existing clients and to attract new clients may  in some cases  be limited by clients perceptions of  or policies concerning  conflicts of interest arising out of other client relationships 
if we are unable to maintain multiple agencies to effectively manage multiple client relationships and avoid potential conflicts of interests  our business and financial results may be materially adversely affected 
in addition  we may lose or fail to attract and retain key personnel 
our employees are our most important assets 
our ability to attract and retain key personnel is an important aspect of our competitiveness 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  our ability to provide our services in the manner our customers have come to expect may be adversely affected  which could harm our reputation and result in a loss of clients  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we receive approximately of our revenue from our largest clients  and the loss of several of these clients could adversely impact our prospects  our business and our results of operations and financial condition 
our clients generally are able to reduce advertising and marketing spending or cancel projects at any time for any reason 
it is possible that our clients could reduce spending in comparison with historical patterns  or they could reduce future spending 
a significant reduction in advertising and marketing spending by our largest clients  or the loss of several of our largest clients  if not replaced by new client accounts or an increase in business from existing clients  would adversely affect our revenue  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we are a global service business and face certain risks of doing business abroad  including political instability and exchange controls  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we face the risks normally associated with global services businesses 
the operational and financial performance of our businesses are typically tied to overall economic and regional market conditions  competition for client assignments and talented staff  new business wins and losses and the risks associated with extensive international operations 
there are some risks of doing business abroad  including those of political instability and exchange controls  which do not affect domestic focused firms 
for financial information on our operations by geographic area  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are exposed to risks from operating in developing countries 
we conduct business in various developing countries around the world 
the risks associated with conducting business in developing countries can include slower payment of invoices  nationalization  social  political and economic instability  and currency repatriation restrictions  among other risks 
in addition  commercial laws in many of these countries can be vague  inconsistently administered and retroactively applied 
if we are deemed not to be in compliance with applicable laws in developing countries where we conduct business  our prospects  business  financial condition and results of operations in those countries could be harmed  which could then have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
downgrades of our debt credit ratings could adversely affect us 
standard and poor s rating service currently rates our long term debt a  moody s investors service rates our long term debt baa and fitch ratings rates our long term debt a 
our short term debt ratings are a  p and f by the respective agencies 
should our debt credit ratings be downgraded  our outstanding senior notes  convertible notes and our existing bank credit facility do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payment upon a downgrade 
the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facility  however  would increase if our long term debt credit rating is downgraded 
additionally  our access to the capital markets could be adversely affected by adverse changes to the short or long term debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies 
holders of our convertible notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to billion  in whole or in part  at specified dates in the future 
if we are required to satisfy a put to repurchase our convertible notes  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund the put 
we also believe that we will still have ample capacity under our existing credit commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event 
however  in the event that our existing credit commitments or our cash flow from operations were decreased  we could experience difficulties in funding our business operations and would have to seek additional funding alternatives as described more fully in our md a 
we may be unsuccessful in evaluating material risks involved in completed and future acquisitions 
we regularly review potential acquisitions of businesses that are complementary to our businesses and client needs 
as part of the review we conduct business  legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating material risks involved in any particular transaction 
despite our efforts  we may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks 
as a result  we might not realize the intended advantages of any given acquisition 
if we fail to identify certain material risks from one or more acquisitions  our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
goodwill may become impaired 
we have recorded a significant amount of goodwill in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap or gaap resulting from our prior acquisition activities  which principally represents the specialized know how of the workforce at the agencies we have acquired 
we annually test the carrying value of goodwill for impairment  as discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the estimates and assumptions about future results of operations and cash flows made in connection with the impairment testing could differ from future actual results of operations and cash flows 
while we have concluded  for each year presented in our financial statements  that our goodwill is not impaired  future events could cause us to conclude that the asset values associated with a given operation may become impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
item b 
unresolved staff comments none 
item properties we maintain office space in many major cities around the world 
the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines and we believe that our facilities are in suitable and well maintained condition for our current operations 
this space is primarily used for office and administrative purposes by our employees in performing professional services 
our principal corporate offices are at madison avenue  new york  new york and one east weaver street  greenwich  connecticut 
we also maintain executive offices in london  england and tokyo  japan 
substantially all of our office space is leased from third parties with varying expiration dates ranging from one to years 
certain of our leases are subject to rent reviews or contain various escalation clauses and certain of our leases require us to pay various operating expenses  which may also be subject to escalation 
leases are generally denominated in the local currency of the operating entity 
our consolidated rent expense was million in  million in and million in  after reduction for rents received from subleases of million  million and million  respectively 
our obligations for future minimum base rents under terms of non cancelable real estate leases and other operating leases  which include primarily office furniture and computer and technology equipment  reduced by rents receivable from non cancelable subleases are in millions net rent thereafter see note to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our lease commitments and our md a for the impact of leases on our operating expenses 
item legal proceedings beginning on june   several putative class actions were filed against us and certain senior executives in the united states district court for the southern district of new york 
the actions have since been consolidated under the caption in re omnicom group inc securities litigation  no 
cv rcc  on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of our common stock between february  and june  the consolidated complaint alleges  among other things  that our public filings and other public statements during that period contained false and misleading statements or omitted to state material information relating to our calculation of the organic growth component of period to period revenue growth  our valuation of and accounting for certain internet investments made by our communicade group communicade  which we contributed to seneca investments llc seneca in  and the existence and amount of certain contingent future obligations in respect of acquisitions 
the complaint seeks an unspecified amount of compensatory damages plus costs and attorneys fees 
defendants moved to dismiss the complaint and on march   the court dismissed portions and of the complaint detailed above 
the court s decision denying the defendants motion to dismiss the remainder of the complaint did not address the ultimate merits of the case  but only the sufficiency of the pleading 
defendants have answered the complaint  and discovery is currently expected to conclude in the first half of plaintiffs have moved to have the proposed class certified and the defendants have opposed that motion  which is now fully briefed 
in addition  on june   a derivative action was filed on behalf of omnicom in new york state court 
on february   a second shareholder derivative action  again purportedly brought on behalf of the company  was filed in new york state court 
the derivative actions have been consolidated before one new york state justice and the plaintiffs have filed an amended consolidated complaint 
the consolidated derivative complaint questions the business judgment of certain current and former directors of omnicom  by challenging  among other things  the valuation of and accounting for the internet investments made by communicade and the contribution of those investments to seneca 
the consolidated complaint alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties of good faith 
the lawsuit seeks from the directors the amount of profits received from selling omnicom stock and other unspecified damages to be paid to the company  as well as costs and attorneys fees 
the defendants moved to dismiss the derivative complaint on the procedural ground that plaintiffs had failed to make a demand on the board 
on june   the trial court entered a decision denying the motion to dismiss 
the decision did not address the merits of the allegations  but rather accepted the allegations as true for the purposes of the motion as the court was required to do and excused plaintiffs from making a demand on the board 
the defendant filed an appeal of the court s decision on the motion to dismiss 
the appeal has been fully briefed and oral argument before the appellate division  first department occurred on february  additionally  the defendants moved for a stay of the proceedings in this litigation pending a decision being issued by the appellate division 
the trial court granted the motion staying the matter until february  the parties have jointly requested the trial court extend the stay to march  since the appellate division has not yet issued a decision 
the defendants in both cases believe that the allegations against them are baseless and intend to vigorously oppose the lawsuits 
currently  we are unable to determine the outcome of these cases and the effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the outcome of any of these matters is inherently uncertain and may be affected by future events 
accordingly  there can be no assurance as to the ultimate effect of these matters 
we are also involved from time to time in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business 
we do not presently expect that these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

we provide professional services to clients through multiple agencies around the world 
on a global  pan regional and local basis  our agencies provide these services in the following disciplines traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
our business model was built and evolves around our clients 
while our companies operate under different names and frame their ideas in different disciplines  we organize our services around our clients 
the fundamental premise of our business is that our clients specific requirements should be the central focus in how we structure our business offerings and allocate our resources 
this client centric business model results in multiple agencies collaborating in formal and informal virtual networks that cut across internal organizational structures to deliver consistent brand messages for a specific client and execute against each of our client s specific marketing requirements 
we continually seek to grow our business with our existing clients by maintaining our client centric approach  as well as expanding our existing business relationships into new markets and with new clients 
in addition  we pursue selective acquisitions of complementary companies with strong  entrepreneurial management teams that typically either currently serve or have the ability to serve our existing client base 
in prior years  our industry was affected by several factors  including geopolitical unrest and lagging economic conditions that contributed to a difficult business environment and industry wide margin contraction 
during this period  we continued to invest in our businesses and our personnel and took action to reduce costs at some of our agencies to address the changing economic circumstances 
recently  improving economic conditions  coupled with the business trends described below  have had a positive impact on our business and our industry 
several long term trends continue to positively affect our business  including our clients increasingly expanding the focus of their brand strategies from national markets to pan regional and global markets and from traditional marketing channels to non traditional channels and new media outlets 
additionally  in an effort to gain greater efficiency and effectiveness from their marketing dollars  clients are increasingly requiring greater coordination of their traditional advertising and marketing activities and concentrating these activities with a smaller number of service providers 
the diversity and balance of our portfolio of companies and service offerings have enabled us to continue to grow our revenue  operating income  net income and earnings per share 
in the united states  revenue grew at a rate of in  which is below our prior year s rate of 
on a constant currency basis  revenue growth for our international business increased by in  which is an increase from our prior year s rate of 
overall  in the past year  we believe that our businesses have performed well across our operating regions 
in addition  we expect to continue to increase our investment in an already improving asian market 
we also plan to focus on businesses that will complement and enhance our existing strategic platforms and service capabilities to better serve our clients in various regions 
in  we experienced an increase in our operating margins over the previous year 
this improvement is the result of our new business initiatives and wins  as well as our cost management actions 
our operating margin for was compared to in we expect that we will be able to maintain operating margins at levels and we will continue to pursue a strategy of optimizing our operating margins and maintaining a high level of investment in our people and our businesses 
given our size and breadth  we manage our business by monitoring several financial indicators 
the key indicators that we review focus on revenue and operating expenses 
we analyze revenue growth by reviewing the components and mix of the growth  including growth by major geographic location  growth by major marketing discipline  growth from currency fluctuations  growth from acquisitions and growth from our largest clients 
in recent years  our revenue has been divided almost evenly between domestic and international operations 
in  our overall revenue growth was  of which was related to changes in foreign exchange rates and was related to the acquisition of entities  net of entities disposed 
the remainder   was organic growth 
in  traditional media advertising represented about of the total revenue and grew by over the prior year 
crm represented about of the total revenue and grew by over the previous year 
public relations represented about of the total revenue and grew by over the previous year and specialty communications represented about of total revenue and grew by over the previous year 
we measure operating expenses in two distinct cost categories  salary and service costs  and office and general expenses 
salary and service costs are primarily comprised of employee compensation related costs and office and general expenses are primarily comprised of rent and occupancy costs  technology related costs and depreciation and amortization 
each of our agencies requires service professionals with a skill set that is common across our disciplines 
at the core of this skill set is the ability to understand a client s brand and its selling proposition  and the ability to develop a unique message to communicate the value of the brand to the client s target audience 
the facility requirements of our agencies are similar across geographic regions and disciplines  and their technology requirements are generally limited to personal computers  servers and off the shelf software 
because we are a service business  we monitor these costs on a percentage of revenue basis 
salary and service costs tend to fluctuate in conjunction with changes in revenue  whereas office and general expenses  which are not directly related to servicing clients  tend to decrease as a percentage of revenue as revenue increases because a significant portion of these expenses are relatively fixed in nature 
during  salary and service costs increased to of revenue from of revenue in this increase is primarily attributable to increased revenue levels and the necessary increases in direct salaries  salary related costs and freelance labor costs necessary to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives  as well as increases in incentive based compensation costs 
office and general expenses declined to of revenue from in as a result of our continuing efforts to better align these costs with business levels on a location by location basis 
our net income for increased by to million from million in and our diluted eps increased by to from in the prior year for the reasons described above  as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year 
this reduction was the result of our purchases of treasury shares net of option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan 
critical accounting policies and new accounting pronouncements critical accounting policies we have prepared the following summary of our accounting policies to assist the reader in better understanding our financial statements and the related md a 
we believe that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements 
readers are encouraged to consider this summary together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to our consolidated financial statements  including our discussion in note setting forth our accounting policies in greater detail  for a more complete understanding of accounting policies discussed below 
estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with us gaap and require us to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities including valuation allowances for receivables and deferred tax assets  accruals for incentive compensation and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during a reporting period 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis and we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results can differ from those estimates  and it is possible that the differences could be material 
a fair value approach is used in testing goodwill for impairment under sfas and when evaluating cost based investments  which consist of ownership interests in non public companies  to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
we consider and use several comparable market participant measurements to determine fair value  including consideration of similar and recent transactions and when available and as appropriate  we use comparative market multiples 
we also use a discounted cash flow methodology 
numerous estimates and assumptions have to be made when completing a discounted cash flow valuation  including estimates and assumptions regarding interest rates  appropriate discount rates and capital structure 
additionally  estimates must be made regarding revenue growth  operating margins  tax rates  working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
judgment is required when determining fair value  including when we evaluate the applicability of similar and recent transactions  and when determining the appropriate comparative market multiples to be used 
actual results of operations  cash flows and other factors used in a discounted cash flow valuation will likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences could be material 
additional information about impairment testing under sfas and valuation of cost based investments appears in note to our consolidated financial statements  as well as note with respect to cost based investments 
a fair value approach is used in determining the award value of stock based employee compensation in accordance with sfas r 
we utilize the black scholes option valuation model to determine the fair value of option awards 
this valuation model uses several assumptions and estimates such as expected life  rate of risk free interest  volatility and dividend yield 
if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value  our actual results of operations and cash flows would likely differ from the estimates used and it is possible that differences and changes could be material 
additional information about these assumptions and estimates appears in note to our consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions and goodwill we have historically made and expect to continue to make selective acquisitions 
in making acquisitions  the price we pay is determined by various factors  including specialized know how  reputation  competitive position  geographic coverage and service offerings  as well as our experience and judgment 
the amount we paid for acquisitions  including cash  stock and assumption of net liabilities  totaled million in and million in approximately and  respectively  of these amounts related to contingent purchase price obligations paid during the respective year related to acquisitions previously completed 
a summary of our contingent purchase price obligations  sometimes referred to as earn outs  and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies is set forth in the liquidity and capital resources section of this md a 
the amount of contingent purchase price obligations and obligations to purchase additional interests in certain subsidiary and affiliate companies are based on future performance 
contingent purchase price obligations are accrued  in accordance with gaap  when the contingency is resolved and payment is certain 
our acquisition strategy has been focused on acquiring the expertise of an assembled workforce in order to continue to build upon the core capabilities of our various strategic business platforms and agency brands through the expansion of their geographic reach and or their service capabilities to better serve our clients 
additional key factors we consider include the competitive position and specialized know how of the acquisition targets 
accordingly  like most service businesses  a substantial portion of the intangible asset value that we acquire is the know how of the people  which is treated as part of goodwill and  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations sfas  is not valued separately 
for each of our acquisitions  we undertake a detailed review to identify other intangible assets and a valuation is performed for all such assets identified 
the majority of the value of the identifiable intangible assets that we acquire is derived from customer relationships 
when making the necessary valuation assumptions of these identified intangible assets  we typically use an income approach and consider comparable market participant measurements 
the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment annually 
in accordance with paragraph of sfas  we identified our regional reporting units as components of our operating segments  which are our five agency networks 
the regional reporting units of each agency network are responsible for the agencies in their region 
they report to the segment managers and facilitate the administrative and logistical requirements of our client centric strategy for delivering services to clients in their regions 
we then concluded  that for each of our operating segments  their regional reporting units had similar economic characteristics and should be aggregated for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment at the operating segment level 
our conclusion was based on a detailed analysis of the aggregation criteria set forth in paragraph of sfas no  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas  and the guidance set forth in eitf d clarification of reporting unit guidance in paragraph of fasb statement no 
consistent with the fundamentals of our business strategy  the agencies within our regional reporting units serve similar clients in similar industries  and in many cases the same clients 
in addition  the agencies within our regional reporting units have similar economic characteristics  as the main economic components of each agency are the salary and service costs associated with providing professional services  the office and general costs associated with office space and occupancy  and the provision of technology requirements which are generally limited to personal computers  servers and off the shelf software 
finally  the expected benefits of our acquisitions are typically shared across multiple agencies and regions as they work together to integrate the acquired agency into our client service strategy 
based on the results of our impairment testing  we concluded that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their book value and therefore  our goodwill was not impaired 
additional information about acquisitions and goodwill appears in notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition substantially all of our revenue is derived from fees for services or a rate per hour  or equivalent basis  and revenue is realized when the service is performed in accordance with terms of each client arrangement  upon completion of the earnings process and when collection is reasonably assured 
we record revenue net of taxes  including sales tax  use tax  value added tax and or excise tax 
certain of our businesses earn a portion of their revenue as commissions based upon performance in accordance with client arrangements 
these principles are the foundation of our revenue recognition policy and apply to all client arrangements in each of our service disciplines traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
more specifically  in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as updated by sab revenue recognition sab  our policy requires the following key elements to be satisfied prior to recognizing revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement must exist  the sales price must be fixed or determinable  delivery  performance and acceptance in accordance with the client arrangement  and collection is reasonably assured 
because the services that we provide across each of our disciplines are similar and delivered to clients in similar ways  all of the key elements set forth above apply to client arrangements in each of our four disciplines 
in the majority of our businesses  we act as an agent and record revenue equal to the net amount retained  when the fee or commission is earned 
in certain cases  we contract directly with suppliers for media payments and third party production costs and are responsible for their payment  recharging our clients for all costs incurred 
although we may bear credit risk in respect of these activities  the arrangements with our clients are such that  in effect  we act as an agent on their behalf 
in these cases  costs incurred with external suppliers are excluded from our revenue 
a small portion of our contractual arrangements with clients include performance incentive provisions designed to link a portion of our revenue to our performance relative to both quantitative and qualitative goals 
we recognize this portion of revenue when the specific quantitative goals are achieved  or when our performance against qualitative goals is determined by our clients 
additional information about our revenue recognition appears in note to our consolidated financial statements 
employee stock based compensation in accordance with sfas  as amended by sfas  we elected  effective january   to account for stock based employee compensation using the fair value method 
in determining the fair value of certain stock based compensation awards  we use certain estimates and assumptions such as expected life  rate of risk free interest  volatility and dividend yield 
if different assumptions and estimates were used to determine the fair value at the date of grant  our actual results could be different 
as a result of our adoption of sfas as amended by sfas  the fair value of stock based employee compensation was recorded as an expense in the current and prior years 
accordingly  our results for years prior to have been restated as if we had used the fair value method to account for stock based employee compensation 
pre tax stock based employee compensation expense for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
information about our specific awards and stock plans can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r that requires  among other things  that we record stock based compensation expense net of an estimate for awards that are expected to be forfeited 
for all unvested awards outstanding at january   we recorded an adjustment to reflect the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
the adjustment in the first quarter of resulted in an increase in our operating profit and net income of million and million  respectively 
because this adjustment did not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition  we did not present this adjustment on an after tax basis as a cumulative effect of accounting change in our income statement 
sfas r also requires that new stock based compensation awards issued to individuals that are  or will become  retirement eligible during the vesting period of the award to be expensed over the lesser of the period from the date of grant through the retirement eligible date or the vesting date 
this differs from our previous policy for awards that were issued prior to adoption of sfas r with retirement eligibility provisions 
for those awards  we recognized compensation expense over the vesting period and we accelerated compensation expense upon the triggering of a retirement event 
for the year ended december   million of pre tax amortization of stock based employee compensation expense was recorded related to unvested awards at december  that were issued prior to adoption of sfas r to individuals that were retirement eligible at december  and the awards included retirement eligibility provisions 
had sfas r been in effect when these awards were issued  stock based compensation expense in would have been reduced by million 
sfas r provides transition alternatives with respect to calculating the pool of windfall tax benefits within our additional paid in capital the apic pool that are available on the adoption date to offset potential future shortfalls 
the apic pool results from the amount by which our prior year tax deductions for stock based compensation exceed the cumulative book stock based compensation expense recognized in our financial statements

finally  sfas r requires that the benefits associated with the tax deductions in excess of recognized stock based employee compensation expense be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow  as previously required

revenue when comparing performance between years  we discuss non gaap financial measures such as the impact that foreign currency rate changes  acquisitions dispositions and organic growth have on reported revenue 
we derive significant revenue from international operations and changes in foreign currency rates between the years impact our reported results 
our reported results are also impacted by our acquisition and disposition activity and organic growth 
accordingly  we provide this information to supplement the discussion of changes in revenue period to period 
our consolidated worldwide revenue increased to  million from  million in the effect of foreign exchange impacts increased worldwide revenue by million 
acquisitions  net of disposals  increased worldwide revenue by million and organic growth increased worldwide revenue by million 
the components of total revenue growth in the us domestic and the remainder of the world international are summarized below dollars in millions total domestic international december     components of revenue changes foreign exchange impact acquisitions organic december     the components and percentages are calculated as follows the foreign exchange impact component shown in the table is calculated by first converting the current period s local currency revenue using the average exchange rates from the equivalent prior period to arrive at a constant currency revenue in this case  million for the total column in the table 
the foreign exchange impact equals the difference between the current period revenue in us dollars and the current period revenue in constant currency in this case  million less  million for the total column in the table 
the acquisition component shown in the table is calculated by aggregating the applicable prior period revenue of the acquired businesses 
netted against this number is the revenue of any business included in the prior period reported revenue that was disposed of subsequent to the prior period 
the organic component shown in the table is calculated by subtracting both the foreign exchange and acquisition revenue components from total revenue growth 
the percentage change shown in the table of each component is calculated by dividing the individual component amount by the prior period revenue base of that component in this case  million for the total column in the table 
the components of revenue for and revenue growth compared to in our primary geographic markets are summarized below dollars in millions revenue growth united states  euro markets  united kingdom  other  total  as indicated  foreign exchange impacts increased our international revenue by million for the most significant impacts resulted from the strengthening of the canadian dollar  british pound  euro and brazilian real against the us dollar  which was offset primarily by the decline of the japanese yen against the us dollar 
based on exchange rates at january   we expect foreign exchange impacts to increase our full year consolidated revenue by between and 
additional geographic information relating to our business is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements 
due to a variety of factors  in the normal course  our agencies both gain and lose business from clients each year 
the net result in  and historically each year for us as a whole  was an overall gain in new business 
under our client centric approach  we seek to broaden our relationships with our largest clients 
revenue from our single largest client represented of our worldwide revenue in and in no other client represented more than in or our ten largest and largest clients represented and of our worldwide revenue  respectively  and and of our worldwide revenue  respectively 
driven by our clients continuous demand for more effective and efficient branding activities  we strive to provide an extensive range of advertising  marketing and corporate communications services through various client centric networks that are organized to meet specific client objectives 
these services include advertising  brand consultancy  crisis communications  custom publishing  database management  digital and interactive marketing  direct marketing  directory advertising  entertainment marketing  environmental design  experiential marketing  field marketing  financial corporate business to business advertising  graphic arts  healthcare communications  instore design  investor relations  marketing research  media planning and buying  mobile marketing services  multi cultural marketing  non profit marketing  organizational communications  package design  product placement  promotional marketing  public affairs  public relations  recruitment communications  reputation consulting  retail marketing  search engine marketing and sports and event marketing 
in an effort to monitor the changing needs of our clients and to further expand the scope of our services to key clients  we monitor revenue across a broad range of disciplines and group them into the following four categories as summarized below traditional media advertising  crm  public relations and specialty communications 
year ended december  dollars in millions vs revenue of revenue revenue of revenue growth growth traditional media advertising   crm   public relations   specialty communications   operating expenses our worldwide operating expenses increased million  or  to  million from  million in  as shown below

during  we continued to invest in our businesses and their professional personnel 
as a percentage of total operating expenses  salary and service costs were in and in these costs are comprised of salary and related costs and direct service costs 
most  or million and  of the million increase in total operating expenses in resulted from increases in salary and service costs 
this increase was attributable to the increase in our revenue in and the necessary increases in the direct costs required to deliver our services and pursue new business initiatives  including direct salaries  salary related costs and direct service costs  including freelance labor costs and direct administrative costs  such as travel  as well as increases in incentive based compensation costs 
this increase was partially offset by reductions in severance and employee stock based compensation expense 
as a result  salary and service costs as a percentage of revenue increased year to year from in to in office and general expenses represented and of our operating expenses in and  respectively 
these costs are comprised of office and equipment rents  technology costs and depreciation  amortization of identifiable intangible assets  professional fees and other overhead expenses 
as a percentage of revenue  office and general expenses decreased in from to as a result of continuing efforts to better align these costs with business levels on a location by location basis 
these costs are less directly linked to changes in our revenues than our salary and service costs 
although they tend to increase as our revenues increase  the rate of increase could be more  or less than the rate of increase in our revenues 
we expect our efforts to control operating expenses will continue as we continuously look for ways to increase the variability of our cost structure 
we expect that we will be able to maintain operating margins at levels and we will continue to pursue a strategy of optimizing our operating margins and maintaining a high level of investment in our people and our businesses 
included in office and general expense for operating margin is a pre tax net loss of million arising from the sale in the third quarter of a us based healthcare business and several small businesses 
the sale of the healthcare business resulted in a high book tax rate primarily caused by the non deductibility of goodwill 
this increase in income tax expense was more than offset by a one time reduction of income tax expense from the resolution of uncertainties related to changes in certain foreign tax laws 
the aggregate impact of these events was a decrease in profit before tax of million  a decrease in tax expense of million and an increase in net income of million 
excluding the net loss of million  our operating margin was unchanged

 debtor s accounting for a modification or exchange of debt instruments eitf  of supplemental interest payments made with respect to our liquid yield option notes due notes 
these increases were partially offset by interest expense savings relative to the redemption at maturity in june of our euro denominated million notes  as well as interest expense savings under our commercial paper program compared to the prior year 
the increase in interest income is the result of increased levels of cash and short term investments on hand during the year as well as increases in short term interest rates

the note  due in march  bears interest at a rate of per annum 
the recapitalization transaction was required to be recorded at fair value and  accordingly  we recorded a pre tax net gain of million 
this gain was partially offset by losses of million on other cost based investments unrelated to our investment in seneca

substantially all of the year over year increase in these supplemental interest payments was due to market increases in short term interest rates 
these increases were partially offset by interest expense savings relative to the redemption at maturity in june of our million notes 
income taxes our consolidated effective income tax rate was 
excluding the impact relating to an unusually high book tax rate on the net gain on the sale of certain foreign businesses  as described above in our discussion on operating expenses  our tax rate was which is comparable to our year rate of 
the fasb issued two staff positions on accounting for income taxes to address recent changes enacted by the united states congress  staff position fas  application of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  for the tax deduction provided to us based manufacturers by the american jobs creation act of the jobs act fsp no 
 and staff position fas  accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings repatriation provisions within the american jobs creation act of fsp no 

we believe that fsp does not apply to our business 
in the fourth quarter of  we repatriated million of foreign earnings utilizing the dividend received deduction provided by the jobs act and in accordance with fsp  we recorded a million domestic tax liability  which is included in our full year effective tax rate of 
earnings per share eps for the foregoing reasons  our net income in increased million by  to million from million in diluted earnings per share increased to in  as compared to in the prior year for the reasons described above  as well as the impact of the reduction in our weighted average shares outstanding for the year 
this reduction was the result of our purchases of treasury shares net of option exercises and share issuances under our employee stock purchase plan 
liquidity and capital resources cash requirements  including contractual obligations historically  substantially all of our non discretionary cash requirements have been funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand 
our principal non discretionary funding requirement is our working capital 
in addition  as discussed below  we have contractual obligations related to our debt  senior notes and convertible notes  our recurring business operations primarily related to lease obligations  as well as certain contingent acquisition obligations related to acquisitions made in prior years 
our principal discretionary cash requirements include dividend payments to our shareholders  repurchases of our common stock  payments for strategic acquisitions and capital expenditures 
our discretionary spending is funded from operating cash flow and cash on hand and  in  from our billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due april  senior notes offering 
the gross proceeds from the senior notes sold in march were million 
in addition  in any given year  depending on the level of discretionary activity  we may use other sources of available funding  such as the liquidation of short term investments or the issuance of commercial paper to finance these activities 
we have a seasonal working capital cycle 
working capital requirements are lowest at year end 
the fluctuation in working capital requirements between the lowest and highest points during the course of the year can be more than billion 
this cycle occurs because our businesses incur costs on behalf of our clients  including when we place media and incur production costs 
we generally require collection from our clients prior to our payment for the media and production cost obligations 
during the year  we manage liquidity through our credit facilities as discussed below under cash management 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents increased by million from december  the components of the increase in are summarized below dollars in millions sources cash flow from operations  gross proceeds from issuance of senior notes eliminate changes in net working capital subtotal  principal cash sources  uses capital expenditures dividends paid acquisition payments  net of cash acquired and proceeds from sale of million purchase of treasury shares net of proceeds from stock option exercises and stock sold in our employee stock purchase plan of million  subtotal  principal discretionary cash uses  principal cash sources in excess of discretionary cash uses repayment of principal of long term debt eliminate changes in net working capital exchange rate changes other  principally net proceeds from sales of short term investments increase in cash and cash equivalents the principal cash sources and principal discretionary cash uses numbers presented above are non gaap financial measures 
these amounts exclude changes in working capital and certain other investing and financing activities  including commercial paper issuances and redemptions  used to fund these working capital changes 
this presentation reflects the metrics used by us to assess our sources and uses of cash and was derived from our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we believe that this presentation is meaningful for understanding our primary sources and primary uses of that cash flow 
additional information regarding our cash flows can be found in our consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments we enter into numerous contractual and commercial undertakings in the normal course of our business 
the following table summarizes information about certain of our obligations as of december  and should be read together with note bank loans and lines of credit  note long term debt and convertible notes  note commitments and contingent liabilities  note fair value of financial instruments and note financial instruments and market risk to our consolidated financial statements 
due in less than year due in to years due after years total contractual obligations at december  dollars in millions long term debt  convertible notes   lease obligations   other total    as more fully described below under the heading debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants  the holders of the convertible notes included in the table above have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate face amount of the notes then outstanding for par value at certain dates in the future 
if these rights were exercised at the earliest possible future date  as set forth in note to our consolidated financial statements   million of the  million of the convertible notes could be due in less than one year 
due in less than year due in to years due after years total other commercial commitments at december  dollars in millions lines of credit guarantees and letters of credit total in the normal course of business  our agencies enter into various contractual media commitments on behalf of our clients at levels substantially exceeding our revenue 
these commitments are included in our accounts payable balance when the media services are delivered by the providers 
historically  we have not experienced significant losses for media commitments entered into on behalf of our clients and we believe that we do not have substantial exposure to potential losses of this nature in the future as we monitor closely the credit worthiness of our clients 
in the event that we are committed to the media services and our client has not paid us  we believe that the risk of material loss is minimal because in the normal course of business we have reasonable options available to us to substantially mitigate potential losses 
contingent acquisition obligations certain of our acquisitions are structured with contingent purchase price obligations  often referred to as earn outs 
we utilize contingent purchase price structures in an effort to minimize the risk to us associated with potential future negative changes in the performance of the acquired entity during the post acquisition transition period 
these payments are not contingent upon future employment 
the amount of future contingent purchase price payments that we would be required to pay for prior acquisitions  assuming that the businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels  is approximately million as of december  the ultimate amounts payable cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty because they are dependent upon future results of operations of the subject businesses and are subject to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in accordance with us gaap  we have not recorded a liability for these items on our balance sheet since the definitive amount is not determinable or distributable 
actual results can differ from these estimates and the actual amounts that we pay are likely to be different from these estimates 
our obligations change from period to period primarily as a result of payments made during the current period  changes in the acquired entities performance and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
these differences could be significant 
the contingent purchase price obligations as of december   calculated assuming that the acquired businesses perform over the relevant future periods at their current profit levels  are as follows dollars in millions thereafter total in addition  owners of interests in certain of our subsidiaries or affiliates have the right in certain circumstances to require us to purchase additional ownership interests in those companies 
assuming that the subsidiaries and affiliates perform over the relevant periods at their current profit levels  the aggregate amount we could be required to pay in future periods is approximately million  million of which relates to obligations that are currently exercisable 
if these rights are exercised  there would be an increase in our net income as a result of our increased ownership and the reduction of minority interest expense 
the ultimate amount payable relating to these transactions will vary because it is primarily dependent on the future results of operations of the subject businesses  the timing of the exercise of these rights and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the actual amount that we pay is likely to be different from this estimate and the difference could be significant 
the obligations that exist for these agreements as of december   calculated using the assumptions above  are as follows dollars in millions currently exercisable not currently exercisable total subsidiary agencies affiliated agencies total sources and uses of cash our cash requirements have historically been funded by a combination of our operating cash flow and cash on hand  as well as points in time when we have opportunistically accessed the capital markets 
our capital market transactions have included issuing billion in ten year fixed rate notes in and convertible notes in an aggregate principle amount of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the proceeds were used for general corporate purposes  including the repurchase of our shares and the repayment of maturing debt 
on march   we entered into an agreement to purchase million shares of our outstanding common stock for million 
we repurchased the shares under an accelerated share repurchase asr program with a financial institution at per share with an initial settlement date of april  the purchase was funded using a portion of the proceeds from our senior notes offering 
during the second quarter of  the financial institution purchased the million shares of our common stock in the open market and we paid a settlement amount of million  referred to as the purchase price adjustment  based upon the difference between the actual cost of the shares purchased by the financial institution of per share and the initial purchase price of per share 
at december   we had  million in cash and cash equivalents 
in addition  we had billion in unused committed credit facilities available for immediate use to fund our cash needs 
these credit facilities are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
our operating cash flow and access to the capital markets could be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of our control 
additionally  access to the capital markets could be impaired by adverse changes to the short and long term debt credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies 
standard and poor s rating service currently rates our long term debt a  moody s investors service rates our long term debt baa and fitch ratings rates our long term debt a 
our short term debt credit ratings are a  p and f by the respective agencies 
our outstanding senior notes  convertible notes and bank credit facilities do not contain provisions that require acceleration of cash payments should our debt credit ratings be downgraded 
the interest rates and fees on our bank credit facilities  however  will increase if our long term debt credit rating is lowered 
as described in note  our committed bank facilities contain two financial covenants relating to cash flow and interest coverage  which we met by a significant margin as of december  we believe that our current financial condition provides us with the ability to readily access the capital markets 
also  our cash balances combined with our liquidity of short term investments  operational cash flows and unused committed borrowing capacity are sufficient to support our foreseeable cash requirements  arising from working capital  outstanding debt  capital expenditures  dividends  acquisitions and stock repurchases 
cash management we manage our cash and liquidity centrally through treasury centers in north america and europe 
each day  operations with excess funds invest these funds with their regional treasury center 
likewise  operations that require funding will borrow funds from their regional treasury center 
the treasury centers then aggregate the net position of the operating companies 
the net position is either invested with or borrowed from third party providers 
to the extent that our treasury centers require liquidity  they have the ability to access local currency lines of credit  our billion committed bank facilities  or issue up to  million of us dollar denominated commercial paper 
this enables us to reduce our consolidated debt levels and minimize interest expense as well as centrally manage our exposure to foreign exchange 
our cash and cash equivalents increased by million and our short term investments decreased by million from the prior year 
short term investments include investments of our excess cash which we expect to convert into cash in our current operating cycle  generally within one year 
we manage our net debt position  which we define as total debt outstanding less cash and short term investments  centrally through our treasury centers as discussed above 
our net debt outstanding at december  decreased by million as compared to the prior year end  as summarized below dollars in millions debt bank loans due less than year commercial paper issued under billion revolver due june  senior notes due april  convertible notes due february  convertible notes due july  convertible notes due june  convertible notes due july  other debt total debt   cash and short term investments   net debt   net debt is a non gaap financial measure 
we believe this presentation is meaningful for understanding our net debt position and it reflects one of the key metrics used by us to assess our cash management 
debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants we maintain a credit facility with a consortium of banks providing borrowing capacity of up to  million as described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
this credit facility is available to provide credit support for issuances under our  million commercial paper program  as well as to provide back up liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us 
we typically fund our daily borrowing needs by issuing commercial paper or by borrowing under our short term uncommitted lines of credit 
occasionally  we may draw down on our credit facility 
during  we issued and redeemed billion of commercial paper 
the average term of the commercial paper was days 
as of december   we had no commercial paper or bank loans outstanding under these credit facilities 
at december   we had short term bank loans of million outstanding  which are comprised of bank overdrafts by our international subsidiaries 
these bank overdrafts are treated as unsecured loans pursuant to the subsidiaries bank agreements 
our credit facility contains financial covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness as defined in the agreements 
these financial covenants limit the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda for these purposes  ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to no more than times 
in addition  they require us to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least times 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants  as our ratio of debt to ebitda was times and our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was times 
in march  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of senior notes due april  the gross proceeds from the issuance were million 
the gross proceeds less fees resulted in a yield to maturity 
the senior notes were issued by omnicom group inc and two of our wholly owned finance subsidiaries  omnicom capital inc and omnicom finance inc  as co obligors similar to our convertible notes 
the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the co obligors 
in june  upon maturity  we redeemed our euro denominated bonds for million 
the bonds paid a fixed rate of to maturity 
at december   we had a total of  million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes outstanding  including million notes that were issued in february  million notes that were issued in march  million notes that were issued in june and million zero coupon zero yield convertible notes due notes that were originally issued in june as notes and were subsequently amended in june to become the notes 
the holders of our notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in february of each year 
the holders of our notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value in august of each year 
the holders of our notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value on june      and on each june annually thereafter through june  the holders of our notes have the right to cause us to repurchase up to the entire aggregate principal amount of the notes then outstanding for par value on june      and on each june annually thereafter through june  the   and notes are convertible  at specified ratios  only upon the occurrence of certain events  including if our common shares trade above certain levels  if we effect extraordinary transactions or  in the case of the notes and the notes  if our long term debt credit ratings are downgraded to bbb or lower by standard poor s ratings service  or baa or lower by moody s investors service or in the case of the notes and the notes to bbb or lower by s p  and ba or lower by moody s 
these events would not  however  result in an adjustment of the number of shares issuable upon conversion and would not accelerate the holder s right to cause us to repurchase the notes 
for additional information about the terms of these notes  see note to our consolidated financial statements 
in august  we paid a supplemental interest payment of million to qualified noteholders of our notes  equal to per  principal amount of notes  that did not put their notes back to us 
the total supplemental interest payment is being amortized ratably over a month period to the next put date ending in august in accordance with eitf in february  we paid a supplemental interest payment of million to qualified noteholders of our notes that did not put their notes back to us

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange our results of operations are subject to risk from the translation to the us dollar of the revenue and expenses of our foreign operations  which are generally denominated in the local currency 
the effects of currency exchange rate fluctuation on the translation of our results of operations are discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
for the most part  our revenue and the expenses incurred related to that revenue are denominated in the same currency 
this minimizes the impact that fluctuations in exchange rates will have on our net income 
while our agencies conduct business in more than different currencies  our major non us currency markets are the european monetary union emu  the united kingdom  japan  brazil and canada 
as an integral part of our treasury operations  we enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts which manage the foreign exchange risk of the intercompany cash movements between subsidiaries operating in different currency markets from that of our treasury centers from which they borrow or invest 
in the limited number of instances where operating expenses and revenue are not denominated in the same currency  amounts are promptly settled or hedged in the foreign currency market with forward contracts 
at december   we had forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding with an aggregate notional principal of million mitigating the foreign exchange risk of intercompany cash movement 
the majority of the contracts were denominated in our major international market currencies with maturities ranging from two to days with an average duration of just over days 
in addition to hedging intercompany cash movement  we enter into short term forward foreign exchange contracts which hedge us dollar commercial paper issued by our london treasury center  whose functional currency is the british pound 
at december   we had no forward contracts outstanding relating to this activity as there was no commercial paper outstanding 
additionally  at december  we had cross currency interest rate swaps in place with an aggregate notional principal amount of million euro maturing in and japanese yen based cross currency interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional principal amount of japanese yen billion maturing in see note to our consolidated financial statements for information about the fair value of each type of derivative instrument 
the forward foreign exchange and swap contracts discussed above were entered into for the purpose of hedging certain specific currency risks 
these risks are primarily the result of the temporary movement of money from one local market to another as part of our cash management program 
as a result of these financial instruments  we reduced financial risk in exchange for foregoing any gain reward which might have occurred if the markets moved favorably 
in using these contracts  we exchanged the risks of the financial markets for counterparty risk 
to minimize counterparty risk  we only enter into these contracts with major well known banks and financial institutions that have debt credit ratings equal to or better than our credit rating 
these hedging activities are confined to risk management activities related to our international operations 
we have established a centralized reporting system to evaluate the effects of changes in interest rates  currency exchange rates and other relevant market risks 
we periodically determine the potential loss from market risk by performing a value at risk computation 
value at risk analysis is a statistical model that utilizes historic currency exchange and interest rate data to measure the potential impact on future earnings of our existing portfolio of derivative financial instruments 
the value at risk analysis we performed on our december  portfolio of derivative financial instruments indicated that the risk of loss was immaterial 
this overall system is designed to enable us to initiate remedial action  if appropriate 
debt instruments in march  we issued billion aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due april  the gross proceeds from the issuance were million 
the gross proceeds less fees resulted in a yield to maturity 
the senior notes were issued by omnicom group inc and two of our wholly owned finance subsidiaries  omnicom capital inc and omnicom finance inc  as co obligors  similar to our convertible notes 
the senior notes are senior unsecured notes that rank in equal right of payment with all existing and future unsecured indebtedness and as a joint and several liability of the issuer and the co obligors 
in june  we amended and extended our five year credit facility to june  and increased the amount available from billion to billion with substantially the same bank consortium 
in conjunction with this amendment and extension  we terminated our million day revolving credit facility that was due to expire 
subsequently  in september  the facility was increased from billion to billion 
we have the ability to classify outstanding borrowings  if any  under our five year credit facility as long term debt 
in funding our day to day liquidity  we are an active participant in the commercial paper market with a billion program 
as of december   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
our credit facility provides credit support for commercial paper  as well as providing back up liquidity in the event any of our convertible notes are put back to us 
our bank syndicate includes large global banks such as citibank  jp morgan chase  hsbc  abn amro  deutsche  bank of america  societe generale and bbva 
we also include large regional banks in the us such as wachovia  us bancorp  northern trust  pnc and wells fargo 
we also include banks that have a major presence in countries where we conduct business such as sumitomo in japan  fortis in belgium  intesa san paolo in italy  scotia in canada and westpac in australia 
our other long term debt consists principally of convertible notes 
as previously discussed  the holders of these convertible notes have the right on specific dates to cause us to repurchase up to the aggregate principal amount 
we may offer the holders of our convertible notes a supplemental interest payment or other incentives to induce them not to put the convertible notes to us in advance of a put date 
if we were to decide to pay a supplemental interest payment  the amount incurred would be based on a combination of market factors at the time of the applicable put date  including our stock price  short term interest rates and a factor for credit risk 
if the convertible notes are put back to us  our interest expense could increase 
the extent  if any  of the increase in interest expense will depend on the portion of the amount repurchased that was refinanced  when we refinance  the type of instrument we use to refinance and the term of the instrument 
the supplemental interest payments made in and to qualified noteholders  as described above under debt instruments  guarantees and related covenants  are one method of keeping the convertible notes outstanding 
if we are required to satisfy a put  based on our current financial condition and expectations  we expect to have sufficient available cash and unused credit commitments to fund any put  while still preserving ample capacity under these commitments to meet our cash requirements for the normal course of our business operations after the put event 
our credit commitments allow either the issuance of commercial paper or bank loans  and we would likely fund the put initially using some combination of these instruments 
we would then evaluate all funding alternatives available to us to replenish our credit capacity and liquidity 
we believe the funding alternatives would include substantially all forms of debt  equity and convertible instruments available to us by accessing the public or private capital markets 
our evaluation would likely include the expected cash flows from the normal course of our business operations and the credit capacity to fund additional potential puts on the remaining outstanding convertible notes 
currently  we meet all of our debt covenant requirements 
our credit facilities contain financial covenants limiting the ratio of total consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated ebitda for purposes of these covenants ebitda is defined as earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization to no more than times 
at december   our ratio of debt to ebitda was times 
in addition  we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of ebitda to interest expense of at least times 
at december   our ratio of ebitda to interest expense was times 
we were in compliance with these covenants 
in addition  the credit facilities do not limit our ability to declare or pay dividends 
even if we were to replace the convertible notes with another form of debt on a dollar for dollar basis  it would have no impact on either our debt to capital ratios or our debt to ebitda ratio 
if we were to replace our convertible notes with interest bearing debt at prevailing rates  this potential increase in interest expense would negatively impact our coverage ratios  such as ebitda to interest expense 
however  the coverage ratios applicable to our credit facilities and ratings levels are currently well within the thresholds 
if either our ratio of debt to ebitda increased by  or our ratio of ebitda to interest expense decreased by  we would still be in compliance with these covenants 
therefore  based on our current coverage ratios  our present expectations of our future operating cash flows and expected access to debt and equity capital markets  we believe any increase in interest expense and reduction in coverage ratios would still place us comfortably above the coverage ratio requirements 
thus  we do not expect any negative impact on our credit ratings if the convertible notes are put to us
