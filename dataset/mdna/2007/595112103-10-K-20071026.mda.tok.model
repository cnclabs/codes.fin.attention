restructure the company is pursuing a number of initiatives to reduce costs and increase revenue across its operations 
these initiatives include workforce reductions in certain areas of the company as the company s business is realigned 
additional initiatives include establishing certain operations closer in location to the company s global customers  evaluating functions more efficiently performed through partnerships or other outside relationships and reducing the company s overhead costs to meet or exceed industry benchmarks 
the company is also exploring opportunities to leverage the company s technology and diversified product portfolio to increase revenue and shareholder value 
it is anticipated that these initiatives will be implemented over several quarters 
in the fourth quarter of  the company incurred a restructure charge of million in connection with the implementation of these cost reduction initiatives 
the fourth quarter charge was comprised primarily of employee severance and related costs resulting from a reduction in the company s workforce 
the company anticipates that it will incur some level of restructure charges through the end of as it continues to implement these initiatives  but is currently unable to estimate the aggregate amount of such charges
