this store is anticipated to open in fall inflation in the last three years  inflation has not had a significant impact on the company because of a relatively low inflation rate 
most of the leases at the centers have rent adjustments periodically through the lease term 
these rent increases are either in fixed increments or based on using an annual multiple of increases in the consumer price index cpi 
in addition  about of the leases expire each year  which enables the company to replace existing leases with new leases at higher base rents if the rents of the existing leases are below the then existing market rate 
additionally  historically the majority of the leases required the tenants to pay their pro rata share of operating expenses 
in january  the company began entering into leases that require tenants to pay a stated amount for operating expenses  generally excluding property taxes  regardless of the expenses actually incurred at any center 
this change shifts the burden of cost control to the company 
the macerich company seasonality the shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  particularly in the fourth quarter during the holiday season when retailer occupancy and retail sales are typically at their highest levels 
in addition  shopping malls achieve a substantial portion of their specialty temporary retailer rents during the holiday season and the majority of percentage rent is recognized in the fourth quarter 
as a result of the above  earnings are generally higher in the fourth quarter 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
some of these estimates and assumptions include judgments on revenue recognition  estimates for common area maintenance and real estate tax accruals  provisions for uncollectible accounts  impairment of long lived assets  the allocation of purchase price between tangible and intangible assets  and estimates for environmental matters 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the following policies are deemed to be critical 
revenue recognition minimum rental revenues are recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the related lease 
the difference between the amount of rent due in a year and the amount recorded as rental income is referred to as the straight lining of rent adjustment 
currently  of the mall and freestanding leases contain provisions for cpi rent increases periodically throughout the term of the lease 
the company believes that using an annual multiple of cpi increases  rather than fixed contractual rent increases  results in revenue recognition that more closely matches the cash revenue from each lease and will provide more consistent rent growth throughout the term of the leases 
percentage rents are recognized when the tenants specified sales targets have been met 
estimated recoveries from tenants for real estate taxes  insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized as revenues in the period the applicable expenses are incurred 
property costs related to the development  redevelopment  construction and improvement of properties are capitalized 
interest incurred on development  redevelopment and construction projects is capitalized until construction is substantially complete 
maintenance and repairs expenses are charged to operations as incurred 
costs for major replacements and betterments  which includes hvac equipment  roofs  parking lots  etc  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
gains and losses are recognized upon disposal or retirement of the related assets and are reflected in earnings 
the macerich company property is recorded at cost and is depreciated using a straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows buildings and improvements years tenant improvements years equipment and furnishings years accounting for acquisitions the company accounts for all acquisitions in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
the company will first determine the value of the land and buildings utilizing an as if vacant methodology 
the company will then assign a fair value to any debt assumed at acquisition 
the balance of the purchase price will be allocated to tenant improvements and identifiable intangible assets or liabilities 
tenant improvements represent the tangible assets associated with the existing leases valued on a fair market value basis at the acquisition date prorated over the remaining lease terms 
the tenant improvements are classified as an asset under real estate investments and are depreciated over the remaining lease terms 
identifiable intangible assets and liabilities relate to the value of in place operating leases which come in three forms i leasing commissions and legal costs  which represent the value associated with cost avoidance of acquiring in place leases  such as lease commissions paid under terms generally experienced in the company s markets  ii value of in place leases  which represents the estimated loss of revenue and of costs incurred for the period required to lease the assumed vacant property to the occupancy level when purchased  and iii above or below market value of in place leases  which represents the difference between the contractual rents and market rents at the time of the acquisition  discounted for tenant credit risks 
leasing commissions and legal costs are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and are amortized over the remaining lease terms 
the value of in place leases are recorded in deferred charges and other assets and amortized over the remaining lease terms plus an estimate of renewal of the acquired leases 
above or below market leases are classified in deferred charges and other assets or in other accrued liabilities  depending on whether the contractual terms are above or below market  and the asset or liability is amortized to rental revenue over the remaining terms of the leases 
when the company acquires real estate properties  the company allocates the purchase price to the components of these acquisitions using relative fair values computed using its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions impact the amount of costs allocated between various components as well as the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions 
these allocations also impact depreciation expense and gains or loses recorded on future sales of properties 
generally  the company engages a valuation firm to assist with these allocations 
asset impairment the company assesses whether there has been impairment in the value of its long lived assets by considering factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other economic factors 
such factors include the tenant s ability to perform their duties and pay rent under the terms of the leases 
the company may recognize impairment losses if the cash flows are not sufficient to cover its investment 
such a loss would be determined as the difference between the carrying value and the fair value of a center 
the macerich company deferred charges costs relating to obtaining tenant leases are deferred and amortized over the initial term of the agreement using the straight line method 
costs relating to financing of shopping center properties are deferred and amortized over the life of the related loan using the straight line method  which approximates the effective interest method 
in place lease values are amortized over the remaining lease term plus an estimate of renewal 
leasing commissions and legal costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the individual remaining lease years 
the ranges of the terms of the agreements are as follows deferred lease costs years deferred financing costs years in place lease values remaining lease term plus an estimate for renewal leasing commissions and legal costs years results of operations many of the variations in the results of operations  discussed below  occurred due to the transactions described above including the acquisition centers  acquisition centers  acquisition centers and redevelopment centers
