our backlog for the spring selling season increased million  or  to million as of september  from million as of september  spring orders increased in all key geographic markets  particularly in the united states and international distributor markets 
increased sportswear backlog continues to be the key driver of spring order growth 
although we cannot predict future results with certainty  our reported backlog is one indicator of our anticipated growth rates for the spring selling season  in which the majority of shipments occur in the first and second quarter of many factors  however  may cause actual sales to differ materially from reported future order backlog 
moreover  our spring backlog is not indicative of  and should not be utilized in forecasting  sales beyond the spring selling season

net sales from accessories decreased million  or  to million in from million in the decrease in accessories sales was the result of decreased sales in all major geographic regions

warm weather conditions throughout europe during the third and fourth quarters also affected europe sales unfavorably 
despite these negative factors  europe sales increased predominantly as the result of increased sales in switzerland  france and italy while sales in other key markets including spain  germany and the united kingdom decreased

gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in we primarily attribute the decrease in gross profit margin to increased competition and inefficiencies in our fall product line  lower gross margins on pacific trail and montrail shipments and various other less significant items  including stock based compensation expense  european anti dumping duties imposed on chinese and vietnamese footwear imports and certain international promotional campaigns 
the negative gross margin effect of these items was partially offset by a reduction in sales of closeout products 
the most significant factor that adversely affected our gross profit margins was increased competition in the united states and europe 
as a result of these competitive pressures  we broadened our product assortment  resulting in sourcing inefficiencies  and more competitively priced our fall products  both of which negatively affected our gross profit margins 
a decrease in closeout sales at higher gross margins compared to had a favorable effect on our consolidated gross profits 
this decrease is partially attributable to elevated closeout sales levels in due to unseasonably cool weather conditions in the early part of the spring season in the united states

footwear sales growth resulted from increased sales to large account customers particularly in france and spain  while footwear sales decreased in germany and the netherlands primarily due to difficult economic conditions in those countries 
the increase in outerwear sales was largely attributable to increased sales resulting from the acquisition of our distributor in switzerland  tecnisport sa  in july of with the acquisition of tecnisport  we began recognizing sales at end customer direct prices  rather than the lower independent distributor prices that applied prior to the acquisition under our distributor agreement with tecnisport

an increase in close out sales at lower gross margins compared to also had an unfavorable effect on our consolidated gross profits 
this increase in close out sales at lower gross margins resulted from the sale of fall and spring close out product in the united states 
fall close out sales increased due to excess inventory resulting from unseasonably warm weather during the increase in spring close out sales primarily resulted from unseasonably cool weather conditions in the early part of the spring season in the united states 
the unfavorable gross profit impact from shifts in product sales mix  increased inbound air freight and lower gross margins on close out sales were partially offset by an improvement in foreign currency exchange rates for spring and fall compared to spring and fall because our global supply of inventory is generally purchased with us dollars  our foreign businesses benefited from the decrease in value of the us dollar compared to this favorable gross profit impact has been most noticeable in our europe and canada businesses

liquidity and capital resources our primary ongoing funding requirements are to finance working capital and for the continued growth of the business

to fund our domestic working capital requirements  we have available unsecured revolving lines of credit with aggregate seasonal limits ranging from million to million  of which million to million is committed

internationally  our subsidiaries have local currency operating lines in place guaranteed by us with a combined limit of approximately million at december   of which million is designated as a european customs guarantee 
at december   million was outstanding under the japanese line of credit 
we expect to fund our future capital expenditures with existing cash and cash provided by operations 
if the need arises for additional expenditures  we may need to seek additional funding 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on many factors  including prevailing market conditions  our financial condition  and our ability to negotiate favorable terms and conditions 
financing may not be available on terms that are acceptable or favorable to us  if at all 
our operations are affected by seasonal trends typical in the outdoor apparel industry  and have historically resulted in higher sales and profits in the third calendar quarter 
this pattern has resulted primarily from the timing of shipments to wholesale customers for the fall outerwear season 
we believe that our liquidity requirements for at least the next months will be adequately covered by existing cash  cash provided by operations and existing short term borrowing arrangements 
the following table presents our estimated contractual commitments in thousands year ending december  thereafter total line of credit installment payments operating leases non related parties related party installment payments consist of purchase obligations made in the ordinary course of business for non product purchases 
the amounts represent the minimum payments required  including any imputed interest  by contracts and agreements 
these operating lease commitments are not reflected on the consolidated balance sheet under gaap 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we maintain unsecured and uncommitted lines of credit with a combined limit of million at december   available for issuing letters of credit 
at december   we had letters of credit outstanding of million issued for purchase orders for inventory 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position and results of operations are routinely subject to a variety of risks  including market risk associated with interest rate movements on borrowings and investments and currency rate movements on non us dollar denominated assets  liabilities and income 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices that should result in an appropriate level of protection against the adverse effect of these and other potential exposures 
we do not enter into foreign currency or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect cash flows resulting from production purchases  intercompany transactions and other costs from exchange rate movements 
we manage this risk primarily by using forward exchange contracts and options to hedge various firm as well as anticipated commitments and the related receivables and payables  including third party or intercompany transactions 
anticipated  but not yet firmly committed  transactions that we hedge carry a high level of certainty and are expected to be recognized within one year 
we use cross currency swaps to hedge foreign currency denominated payments related to intercompany loan agreements 
hedged transactions are denominated primarily in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollars 
the fair value of our hedging contracts was unfavorable by approximately million at december  and favorable by approximately million at december  a change in the euro  japanese yen and canadian dollar exchange rates would have resulted in the fair value fluctuating approximately million at december  and million at december  changes in fair value  resulting from foreign exchange rate fluctuations  would be substantially offset by the change in value of the underlying hedged transactions 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our debt obligations 
we have no exposure due to interest rate changes on our million and million of long term debt at december  and  respectively 
we have cash flow exposure on our committed and uncommitted bank lines of credit because interest on those lines floats and is based on libor and other interest rate indices 
however  at december   our bank lines of credit had a million balance and thus no material interest rate exposure existed 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make various estimates and judgments that affect reported amounts of assets  liabilities  sales  cost of sales and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements  so we consider these to be our critical accounting policies and estimates 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these matters  actual results could differ from the estimates we use in applying the critical accounting policies 
we base our ongoing estimates on historical experience and other various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of these critical accounting policies affect working capital account balances  including the policy for revenue recognition  the allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable  the provision for potential excess  close out and slow moving inventory  product warranty  income taxes and stock based compensation 

table of contents management and our independent auditors regularly discuss with our audit committee each of our critical accounting estimates  the development and selection of these accounting estimates  and the disclosure about each estimate in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these discussions typically occur at our quarterly audit committee meetings and include the basis and methodology used in developing and selecting these estimates  the trends in and amounts of these estimates  specific matters affecting the amount of and changes in these estimates  and any other relevant matters related to these estimates  including significant issues concerning accounting principles and financial statement presentation 
revenue recognition we record wholesale and licensed product revenues when title passes and the risks and rewards of ownership have passed to the customer  based on the terms of sale 
title generally passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the country of the sale and the agreement with the customer 
retail store revenues are recorded at the time of sale 
in some countries outside of the united states where title passes upon receipt by the customer  predominantly where we sell directly in western europe  precise information regarding the date of receipt by the customer is not readily available 
in these cases  we estimate the date of receipt by the customer based on historical and expected delivery times by geographic location 
we periodically test the accuracy of these estimates based on actual transactions 
delivery times vary by geographic location  generally from one to five days 
to date  we have found these estimates to be materially accurate 
at the time of revenue recognition  we also provide for estimated sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers as reductions to revenues 
the estimates are based on historical rates of product returns and claims 
however  actual returns and claims in any future period are inherently uncertain and thus may differ from the estimates 
if actual or expected future returns and claims are significantly greater or lower than the reserves that we have established  we will record a reduction or increase to net revenues in the period in which we make such a determination 
over the three year period ended december   our actual annual sales returns and miscellaneous claims from customers were less than two percent of net sales 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable we make ongoing estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable and maintain an allowance for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the allowance  we consider our historical level of credit losses and we make judgments about the creditworthiness of customers based on ongoing credit evaluations 
we analyze specific customer accounts  customer concentrations  credit insurance coverage  current economic trends  and changes in customer payment terms 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger allowance may be required 
if we determine that a smaller or larger allowance is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to sg a expense in the period in which we make such a determination 
inventory obsolescence and product warranty we make ongoing estimates of potential future excess  close out or slow moving inventory and product warranty costs 
we identify our excess inventory  a component of which is planned  and evaluate our purchase commitments  sales forecasts  and historical experience  and make provisions as necessary to properly reflect inventory value at the lower of cost or estimated market value 
when we evaluate our reserve for warranty costs  we consider our historical claim rates by season  product mix  current economic trends  and the historical cost to repair  replace  or refund the original sale 
if we determine that a smaller or larger reserve is appropriate  we will record a credit or a charge to cost of sales in the period we make such a determination 

table of contents income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  we recognize income tax expense for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and for the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
we make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our current provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the current provision for income tax take into account current tax laws  our interpretation of current tax laws and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities 
changes in tax law or our interpretation of tax laws and the resolution of current and future tax audits could significantly affect the amounts provided for income taxes in our consolidated financial statements 
our assumptions  judgments and estimates relative to the value of a deferred tax asset take into account predictions of the amount and category of future taxable income 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could cause our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes to be inaccurate 
any of the assumptions  judgments and estimates mentioned above could cause our actual income tax obligations to differ from our estimates  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
on a quarterly basis  we estimate what our effective tax rate will be for the full fiscal year and record an appropriate quarterly income tax provision  in accordance with the anticipated effective rate 
as the calendar year progresses  we periodically refine our estimate based on actual events and earnings by jurisdiction during the year 
this ongoing estimation process can result in changes to our expected effective tax rate for the full calendar year 
when this occurs  we adjust the income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that our year to date provision equals our expected annual effective tax rate 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  under which compensation expense is recognized in the consolidated statement of operations for the fair value of employee stock based compensation 
we have elected the modified prospective transition method as permitted by sfas no 
r and  accordingly  prior periods have not been restated to reflect the effect of sfas no 
r 
the modified prospective transition method requires that stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations include amortization of all stock based compensation granted prior to  but not vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
and amortization of all stock based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
 and related interpretations 
accordingly  under apb opinion no 
 no compensation expense was recognized because the exercise price of our employee stock options was equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
we applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  as if the fair value method had been applied in measuring compensation expense 
as allowed under sfas no 
r  we estimate stock based compensation for stock options granted using the black scholes option pricing model  which requires various highly subjective assumptions  including volatility and expected option life 
in addition  pursuant to sfas no 
r  we estimate forfeitures when calculating stock based compensation expense  rather than accounting for forfeitures as incurred  which was our previous method 
if any of these inputs or assumptions changes significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from the expense recorded in the current period
