item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our tenants 
executive overview weingarten realty investors is a real estate investment trust organized under the texas real estate investment trust act 
we  and our predecessor entity  began the ownership and development of shopping centers and other commercial real estate in our primary business is leasing space to tenants in the shopping and industrial centers we own or lease 
we also manage centers for joint ventures in which we are partners or for other outside owners for which we charge fees 
we operate a portfolio of properties includes neighborhood and community shopping centers and industrial properties of approximately million square feet 
we have a diversified tenant base with our largest tenant comprising only of total rental revenues during we focus on increasing funds from operations and growing dividend payments to our common shareholders 
we do this through hands on leasing  management and selected redevelopment of the existing portfolio of properties  through disciplined growth from selective acquisitions and new developments  and through the disposition of assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria 
we do this while remaining committed to maintaining a conservative balance sheet  a well staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings 
we continue to maintain a strong  conservative capital structure  which provides ready access to a variety of attractive capital sources 
we carefully balance obtaining low cost financing with minimizing exposure to interest rate movements and matching long term liabilities with the long term assets acquired or developed 
at december   we owned or operated under long term leases  either directly or through our interest in joint ventures or partnerships  a total of developed income producing properties and properties under various stages of construction and development 
the total number of centers includes neighborhood and community shopping centers located in arizona  arkansas  california  colorado  florida  georgia  illinois  kansas  kentucky  louisiana  maine  missouri  nevada  new mexico  north carolina  oklahoma  oregon  south carolina  tennessee  utah  texas  and washington 
we also owned industrial projects located in california  florida  georgia  tennessee and texas 
we also owned interests in parcels of unimproved land held for future development that totaled approximately million square feet 
we have approximately  leases with  different tenants at december  
table of contents leases for our properties range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over years for larger tenants 
rental revenues generally include minimum lease payments  which often increase over the lease term  reimbursements of property operating expenses  including ad valorem taxes  and additional rent payments based on a percentage of the tenants sales 
the majority of our anchor tenants are supermarkets  value oriented apparel discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity type goods and services 
we believe stability of our anchor tenants  combined with convenient locations  attractive and well maintained properties  high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix  should ensure the long term success of our merchants and the viability of our portfolio 
in assessing the performance of our properties  management carefully tracks the occupancy of the portfolio 
occupancy for the total portfolio was at december  compared to at december  we expect occupancy to remain at this high level or improve slightly in another important indicator of performance is the spread in rental rates on a same space basis as we complete new leases and renew existing leases 
we completed  new leases or renewals during totaling million square feet  increasing rental rates an average of on a cash basis 
in the first quarter of  we articulated a new long term growth strategy with a planned three year implementation 
the key elements of this strategy are as follows a much greater focus on new development  including merchant development  with million in annual new development completions beginning in increased use of joint ventures for acquisitions including the recapitalization or partial sale of existing assets  which provide the opportunity to further increase returns on investment through the generation of fee income from leasing and management services we will provide to the venture 
further recycling capital through the active disposition of non core properties and reinvesting the proceeds into properties with barriers to entry within high growth metropolitan markets 
this  combined with our continuous focus on our assets  produces a higher quality portfolio with higher occupancy rates and much stronger internal revenue growth 
during  we made excellent progress in the execution of this long term growth strategy as described in the following sections on new development  acquisitions and joint ventures  and dispositions 
new development at december   we had properties in various stages of development  up from properties under development at the end of we have invested million to date on these projects and  at completion  we estimate our total investment to be million 
these properties are slated to open over the next two years with a projected return on investment of approximately when completed 
in addition to these projects  we have significantly increased our development pipeline with nine development sites under contract  which will represent an investment of approximately million 
in addition to the nine development sites under contract  we have another development sites under preliminary pursuit 
merchant development is a new program in which we develop a project with the objective of selling all or part of it  instead of retaining it in our portfolio on a long term basis 
we generated million after tax from this program in adding of earnings and ffo per share 
we are making excellent progress in new development including merchant development activities 
during  we almost tripled the number of properties under development and invested million in our new development program 
acquisitions and joint ventures in  we completed a record billion of acquisitions  including million bought on behalf of joint venture partners 
properties acquired in included shopping centers and seven industrial properties that added a total of million square feet under management 
during  just over half of our acquisitions were with institutional joint ventures 

table of contents we formed the following new joint venture partnerships in we acquired seven neighborhood community shopping centers in south florida in a new joint venture with tiaa cref global real estate  in partnership with aew capital management  on behalf of its institutional client  we acquired four grocery anchored centers and two power centers in oregon and washington  marking our entry into two desirable markets portland  oregon and seattle tacoma  washington  we also formed a joint venture with mercantile real estate advisors and its client  the afl cio building investment trust  to acquire and operate industrial properties within target markets across the united states 
we sold million of our existing assets to the joint venture upon formation 
including the million  the partners plan to invest up to million in total capital over the next two years 
acquisitions are critical to our growth and a key component of our strategy 
however  intense competition for good quality assets has driven asset prices up and returns down 
partnering with institutional investors through joint ventures enables us to acquire high quality assets in our target markets while also meeting our financial return objectives 
we benefit from access to lower cost capital as well as leveraging our expertise to provide fee based services  such as the acquisition  leasing  and management of properties  to the joint ventures 
dispositions during  we sold shopping centers and four industrial projects representing million square feet from our share of the portfolio 
sale proceeds from these dispositions totaled million and generated gains of million 
we also sold an interest in two property portfolios to two joint ventures totaling million 
the proceeds from these dispositions  combined with the joint venture program  provided more than of the capital required for the acquisitions and reduced the need to issue additional common equity or incur additional debt 
capitalizing on strong demand and favorable prices for real estate assets during  we completed a record level of asset sales 
dispositions are part of an on going portfolio management process where we prune our portfolio of properties that do not meet our geographic or growth targets and provide capital to recycle into properties that have barrier to entry locations within high growth metropolitan markets 
over time we expect this to produce a portfolio with higher occupancy rates and much stronger internal revenue growth 
summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  which begins the date the leasehold improvements are substantially complete  if owned by us  or the date the tenant takes control of the space  if the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant 
revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes  maintenance expenses and insurance is recognized in the period the related expense is recorded 
revenue based on a percentage of tenants sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint 

table of contents partially owned joint ventures and partnerships to determine the method of accounting for partially owned joint ventures or partnerships  we first apply the guidelines set forth in fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
based upon our analysis  we have determined that we have no variable interest entities 
partially owned joint ventures or partnerships over which we exercise financial and operating control are consolidated in our financial statements 
in determining if we exercise financial and operating control  we consider factors such as ownership interest  authority to make decisions  kick out rights and substantive participating rights 
partially owned joint ventures and partnerships where we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but do not exercise financial and operating control  are accounted for using the equity method 
property real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation  which  in the opinion of management  is not in excess of the individual property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows  including estimated proceeds from disposition 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and years for parking lot surfacing and equipment 
major replacements where the betterment extends the useful life of the asset are capitalized and the replaced asset and corresponding accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts 
all other maintenance and repair items are charged to expense as incurred 
acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the purchase method and  accordingly  the results of operations of an acquired property are included in our results of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
we have used estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques to allocate the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings on an as if vacant basis  and other identifiable intangibles 
other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities include the effect of out of market leases  the value of having leases in place lease origination and absorption costs  out of market assumed mortgages and tenant relationships 
property also includes costs incurred in the development of new operating properties and properties in our merchant development program 
these properties are carried at costs and no depreciation is recorded on these assets 
these costs include preacquisition costs directly identifiable with the specific project  development and construction costs  interest and real estate taxes 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits  travel and other related costs that are clearly attributable to the development of the property  are also capitalized 
the capitalization of such costs ceases at the earlier of one year from the completion of major construction or when the property  or any completed portion  becomes available for occupancy 
property also includes costs for tenant improvements paid by us  including reimbursements to tenants for improvements that are owned by us and will remain our property after the lease expires 
our properties are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
in such an event  a comparison is made of either the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis or the estimated net sales price to the carrying amount of such property 
such carrying amount is adjusted  if necessary  to the estimated fair value to reflect an impairment in the value of the asset 
some of our properties are held in single purpose entities 
a single purpose entity is a legal entity typically established at the request of a lender solely for the purpose of owning a property or group of properties subject to a mortgage 
there may be restrictions limiting the entity s ability to engage in an activity other than owning or operating the property  assume or guaranty the debt of any other entity  or dissolve itself or declare bankruptcy before the debt has been repaid 
most of our single purpose entities are owned by us and are consolidated in our financial statements 
interest capitalization interest is capitalized on land under development and buildings under construction based on rates applicable to borrowings outstanding during the period and the weighted average balance of qualified assets under development construction during the period 

table of contents deferred charges debt and lease costs are amortized primarily on a straight line basis  which approximates the effective interest method  over the terms of the debt and over the lives of leases  respectively 
lease costs represent the initial direct costs incurred in origination  negotiation and processing of a lease agreement 
such costs include outside broker commissions and other independent third party costs as well as salaries and benefits  travel and other related internal costs incurred in completing the leases 
costs related to supervision  administration  unsuccessful origination efforts and other activities not directly related to completed lease agreements are charged to expense as incurred 
sales of real estate sales of real estate include the sale of shopping center pads  property adjacent to shopping centers  shopping center properties  merchant development properties and investments in real estate ventures 
we recognize profit on sales of real estate  including merchant development sales  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
profits are not recognized until a a sale is consummated  b the buyer s initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay  c the seller s receivable is not subject to future subordination  and d we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership in the transaction  and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the property 
we recognize gains on the sale of real estate to joint ventures in which we participate to the extent we receive cash from the joint venture 
accrued rent and accounts receivable receivable balances outstanding include base rents  tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to the straight lining of rental commitments 
an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable is determined based upon an analysis of balances outstanding  historical bad debt levels  tenant credit worthiness and current economic trends 
income taxes we have elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute to our shareholders 
to be taxed as a reit we must meet a number of requirements including meeting defined percentage tests concerning the amount of our assets and revenues that come from  or are attributable to  real estate operations 
as long as we distribute at least of the taxable income of the reit to our shareholders as dividends  we will not be taxed on the portion of our income we distribute as dividends unless we have ineligible transactions 
the tax relief extension act of gave reits the ability to conduct activities which a reit was previously precluded from doing as long as they are performed in entities which have elected to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries under the irs code 
these activities include buying or developing properties with the express purpose of selling them 
we conduct certain of these activities in taxable reit subsidiaries that we have created 
we calculate and record income taxes in our financial statements based on the activities in those entities 
we also record deferred taxes for the temporary tax differences that have resulted from those activities as required under sfas no

effects of inflation we have structured our leases in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby we receive increased rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than ten years  which allow us to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of our leases also require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon our operating results as they are absorbed by our tenants 
capital resources and liquidity our primary liquidity needs are payment of our common and preferred dividends  maintaining and operating our existing properties  payment of our debt service costs  and funding planned growth 
we anticipate that cash flows from operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for all common and preferred dividend payments and debt service costs  as well as the capital necessary to maintain and operate our existing properties 
primary sources of capital for funding our acquisitions and new development programs are our million revolving credit facility  cash generated from sales of properties that no longer meet our investment criteria  cash flow generated by our operating properties and proceeds from capital issuances as needed 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement are retired as needed with proceeds from the issuance of long term unsecured debt  common and preferred equity  cash generated from dispositions of properties  and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
as of december  the balance outstanding on our million revolving credit facility was million  and there were no borrowings under our million credit facility  which we use for cash management purposes 
our capital structure also includes nonrecourse secured debt that we assume in conjunction with our acquisitions program 
we also have nonrecourse debt secured by acquired or developed properties held in several of our joint ventures 
we hedge the future cash flows of certain debt transactions  as well as changes in the fair value of our debt instruments  principally through interest rate swaps with major financial institutions 
we generally have the right to sell or otherwise dispose of our assets except in certain cases where we are required to obtain a third party consent  such as assets held in entities in which we have less than ownership

also  at december   we had two forward starting interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional amount of million

funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts defines funds from operations as net income loss available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of real estate assets and extraordinary items  plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties  including our share of unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
we believe ffo is an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because it helps investors compare our operating performance relative to other reits 
management also uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 
funds from operations is calculated as follows in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shareholders depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated joint ventures gain on sale of properties gain loss on sale of properties of unconsolidated joint ventures funds from operations funds from operations attributable to operating partnership units funds from operations assuming conversion of op units weighted average shares outstanding basic effect of dilutive securities share options and awards operating partnership units weighted average shares outstanding diluted

fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements 
the interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition of a tax position taken  or expected to be taken  in a tax return 
a tax position may only be recognized in the financial statements if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination

in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles 
the key changes to current practice are the definition of fair value  which focuses on an exit price rather than an entry price  the methods used to measure fair value  such as emphasis that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  as well as the inclusion of an adjustment for risk  restrictions and credit standing and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years

these changes will be reported in comprehensive income of a business entity 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements the recognition provision are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  we recognized an additional liability of thousand as a result of the adoption of the recognition provision of sfas no 
the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial position the measurement provision is effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have assessed the potential impact of sfas no

this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not decided if we will early adopt sfas no 
or if we will choose to measure any eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use fixed and floating rate debt to finance our capital requirements 
these transactions expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
derivative financial instruments are used to manage a portion of this risk  primarily interest rate swap agreements with major financial institutions 
these swap agreements expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counter parties to the swaps 
we do not engage in the trading of derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the net effect of million notional amount of interest rate swaps 
at december   we had fixed rate debt of billion and variable rate debt of million  after adjusting for the net effect of million notional amount of interest rate swaps 
in the event interest rates were to increase basis points  net income and future cash flows would decrease by million and million based upon the variable rate debt and notes receivable outstanding at december  and  respectively  and the fair value of fixed rate debt at december  and would decrease by million and million  respectively
