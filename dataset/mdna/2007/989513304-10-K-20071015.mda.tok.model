item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview you should read the following discussion and analysis md a together with the financial data in the section labeled selected financial data  with the risk factors set forth in item a  and with our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein 
in this md a  zila  the company  we  us  or our refer to zila  inc and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
over the course of the last fiscal year  we have undergone a planned transition from a company with three separate operating segments or business units pharmaceuticals  biotechnology and nutraceuticals to a specialty pharmaceutical company dedicated to the prevention  detection and treatment of oral diseases  with a primary focus on oral cancer 
to accomplish this transition  we acquired pro dentec  a privately held  professional dental products company with a national sales organization that markets directly to dental professionals and has a small suite of proprietary  high margin dental products that complements zila s cancer screening and detection products 
pro dentec continues to operate as our wholly owned subsidiary and we now operate primarily under a direct sales distribution model based upon the integration of pro dentec s sales force 
in addition  we divested our former nutraceuticals business unit and several operations that were previously part of our former pharmaceuticals business unit see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
finally  during fiscal  we also completed two private placements of securities for million with the proceeds used to complete the pro dentec acquisition and to augment existing working capital 

table of contents we manufacture and market vizilite plus with tblue tm vizilite plus  our flagship product  which is rapidly enhancing the standard of care for the early detection of oral abnormalities that could lead to cancer 
vizilite plus is the chemiluminescent disposable light product with our patented pharmaceutical grade toluidine blue  used for the illumination and marking of oral mucosal abnormalities in patients at increased risk for oral cancer 
in addition  zila designs  manufactures and markets a suite of periodontal products sold directly and exclusively to dental professionals  including the rota dent professional powered brush  the pro select platinum ultrasonic scaler and a portfolio of oral pharmaceutical products for both in office and home care use 
our research and development division holds expertise in pre cancer cancer detection through our patented ztc tm and oratest technologies and is developing a pipeline of products focused on oral disease detection and treatment 
in december  we reached an agreement with the food and drug administration fda on the design and size of a phase iii clinical trial for oratest under the fda s special protocol assessment process and commenced patient enrollment 
the agreement was limited to the zil clinical trial and did not include non clinical and chemistry  manufacturing and control cmc issues 
enrollment in zil was open for approximately months  through october  the clinical trial was designed to provide support for safety and efficacy in the oratest new drug application nda and to assess the efficacy of oratest in staining cancerous and pre cancerous oral lesions in a population of tobacco users and or alcohol drinkers  ages and older 
the demonstration of efficacy in the clinical trial is based upon the achievement of a predetermined number of differences in diagnoses between the standard visual exam and the oratest exam 
patient data for the zil trial continues to be monitored by an independent organization to determine if the number of differences required to trigger analysis has been achieved 
the results will be available to us in the coming months  but at this time there can be no assurance that the endpoint requirement necessary for trial completion has been  or will be  achieved 
as with any drug development program  the length of the fda regulatory process and review period varies considerably  as does the amount of data required to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of a specific product 
in addition  delays or rejections may be encountered based upon changes in fda policy  personnel or prior understandings during the period of product development and fda regulatory review or each new drug application 
even if fda approval of a drug application is received  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed and there is no assurance that the product would be successful in gaining market acceptance 
as previously reported  we recently conducted a comprehensive review of all aspects of the oratest program 
the review included its history  present status and future prospects  including the regulatory path to approval of oratest with the fda and its post approval commercial potential and challenges 
we also considered the growing market acceptance for its adjunctive oral cancer screening product  vizilite plus with t blue tm  and the fact that we currently have toluidine blue on the market today in the t blue tm marker 
finally  we considered the fact that we have regulatory approval to sell oratest in a number of international markets today including the united kingdom  australia  belgium  holland  luxembourg  finland  greece  portugal  bermuda and the bahamas  none of which require fda approval 
following completion of the review and analysis described above  we determined that successfully resolving the outstanding cmc and non clinical issues will require substantial additional time and funding  both of which exceed our previous estimates 
further  we believe that at least one additional clinical trial will be required  and even if the endpoint is met on the zil study  no assurance can be made that the fda would view the study data and other additional submissions as sufficient to support the approval of the nda 
we believe that in order to maximize shareholder value  our resources must be directed to those products and programs with the greatest probability of financial return 
our analysis concluded that the incremental market potential of oratest  considering the availability of vizilite plus  does not justify the cost  time and uncertain study outcomes associated with continuing the program in its current form 
also as previously reported  we have initiated the process of seeking a partner in an effort to realize the value of the ztc tm platform 
ztc tm  the active staining component in oratest  may have additional applications  including 
table of contents the detection of high risk lesions of the cervix  esophagus and skin 
we believe that the potential of these additional therapeutic applications could appeal to a partner 
finally  we are taking the steps necessary to capture  secure and analyze the clinical and program data obtained to date  which we intend to use to support the growth of the vizilite plus program 
we conducted an impairment analysis regarding the oratest asset and concluded that based upon future sales of toluidine blue in connection with vizilite plus and oratest international sales  no impairment of the oratest asset is required by generally accepted accounting principles 
results of operations fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended july  the key factors influencing zila s financial performance and operations during fiscal include i transitioned into a focused specialty pharmaceuticals company through the acquisition of pro dentec and the disposition of non core assets  ii changed primarily to a direct sales distribution model upon the integration of the pro dentec national sales force  iii increased vizilite plus growth by improving dental professional awareness to approximately  expanding our customer base through the addition of over  new customers  and by increasing insurance coverage by to million covered lives  iv continued the oratest clinical trial and assessed and evaluated the oratest program  and v initiated actions to reduce expenditures in research and development for the oratest regulatory program and to streamline our organizational structure to reduce overhead costs by approximately million annually 
the following table summarizes our results of continuing operations and related statistical information for the fiscal years ended july  and dollars in thousands for the years ended july  of of revenue revenue change net revenues cost of products sold gross profit operating costs and expenses marketing and selling general and administrative research and development depreciation and amortization loss from operations other income expense net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax benefit expense loss from continuing operations net revenues increased to approximately million for fiscal  compared to net revenues of approximately million for fiscal the growth in net revenues for fiscal is largely driven by our acquisition of pro dentec on november   as well as its effect on vizilite plus net revenues 
vizilite plus 
table of contents net revenues increased to million in fiscal from fiscal  primarily as a result of selling direct to dental offices through pro dentec s national sales organization beginning in december vizilite plus net revenues were affected by our deliberate reductions in sales to our existing distribution channel in the first quarter of fiscal as we prepared to modify our means of distribution upon the completion of the pro dentec acquisition 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was for fiscal compared to for fiscal prior year s gross profit reflects our distributor only business model and the impact of discounts and incentives offered in support of the launch of vizilite plus 
marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues were and  for fiscal and  respectively 
marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased for fiscal as a result of the increased revenue base from the pro dentec acquisition 
marketing and selling expenses for fiscal and were million and million  which represents an increase of 
pro dentec represented the majority of these increases as we integrated its dedicated national sales force that sells directly to dental offices 
increased expenditures for vizilite plus represent the balance of the increase as we continue our efforts to establish vizilite plus as the standard of care for dental offices in the detection of oral abnormalities 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of net revenues  for fiscal  compared to million  or of net revenue  for fiscal the increased expense for fiscal is primarily related to the acquisition and integration of pro dentec  stock based compensation costs and additional support costs for vizilite plus and our oratest regulatory program  severance  professional fees for the special corporate governance review  and settlement costs for the modification of the private placements 
for fiscal and  the reclassification of revenues for discontinued operations significantly impacted general and administrative expenses expressed as a percent of net revenues 
general and administrative expenses for continuing operations include significant public company related costs  which do not vary in relation to net revenues 
as noted above  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we streamlined our operations and reduced overhead costs with an estimated annual savings of approximately million dollars 
research and development expenses increased to million for fiscal from million in fiscal research and development expenses are comprised primarily of costs for the oratest regulatory program 
we incurred higher expense levels in fiscal with the continued efforts of our oratest regulatory program 
as more fully described above  we conducted an extensive review and analysis of our strategic direction  including the oratest regulatory program  and in the first quarter of fiscal  we curtailed enrollment in the oratest clinical trial and ceased expenditures for cmc and non clinical aspects of the oratest regulatory program 
while activities continue to preserve the value of the oratest asset  we believe that our level of expenditures for research and development in the coming fiscal year will be substantially reduced over historical levels 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increased level of depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal is primarily related to the acquisition of pro dentec and its related property  plant  equipment and amortizable intangible assets  as more fully described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
other expense was million for fiscal  compared to other expense of million for fiscal  an increase of 
the increase relates to increased interest expense arising from the retirement of the credit facility credit facility with black diamond commercial finance bdcf in fiscal and the associated non cash expense associated with this retirement 
during fiscal  an aggregate of approximately million of non cash charges were incurred in relation to the write off of unamortized debt financing costs and debt discounts upon the repayments of the bdcf credit facility and the industrial revenue bonds 
these costs were offset by derivative income recognized on the black diamond warrant liability in the first quarter 
income tax benefit of million for fiscal resulted primarily from the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards to offset the income tax expense on the taxable gains on the dispositions of the nutraceuticals business unit and the peridex product line  which are presented in discontinued operations 

table of contents fiscal year ended july  compared to fiscal year ended july  the key factors influencing zila s financial performance and operations during fiscal include i introduced vizilite plus at the october annual meeting of the american dental association and commenced sales in our second fiscal quarter 
vizilite plus consists of a chemiluminescent light source vizilite to improve the identification of lesions and tblue tm  the oral lesion marking system  to mark those lesions differentially identified by vizilite 
vizilite plus with tblue tm is designed to be used in a patient population at increased risk for oral cancer 
ii targeted key geographical markets that demonstrated early acceptance of vizilite and placed specialists into key markets as part of our strategy to establish vizilite as the standard of care for dental offices in the detection of oral abnormalities  iii increased dental professional awareness of vizilite plus to greater than of dentists nationally  iv expanded vizilite distribution into of the nation s group dental practices  v expanded insurance reimbursement for vizilite plus regionally and nationally  vi divested ist in july as part of our ongoing strategy to focus on our core products with the greatest growth potential 
ist is presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements and no longer part of the pharmaceuticals business unit 
vii reached agreement in our second fiscal quarter with the fda on the design and size of a phase iii clinical trial under the fda s special protocol assessment process and commenced patient enrollment 
the clinical trial was designed to provide the support for safety and efficacy of the oratest nda and to assess the efficacy of oratest in staining cancerous and pre cancerous oral lesions in a population of tobacco users and alcohol drinkers  ages and older  viii continued efforts to re commission our manufacturing facility as we prepared to commercialize oratest  and ix continued efforts to determine and address the remaining clinical  non clinical and cmc requirements for the nda 
the following table summarizes our results of operations and related statistical information for the fiscal years ended july  and dollars in thousands for the years ended july  of of revenue revenue change net revenues cost of products sold gross profit operating costs and expenses marketing and selling general and administrative research and development depreciation and amortization loss from operations other income expense net loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense loss from continuing operations 
table of contents net revenues increased to approximately million for fiscal  compared to net revenues of approximately million for fiscal the growth in net revenues for fiscal was driven by the launch of vizilite plus with tblue tm and our strategy of educating the dental professional and broadening distribution channels 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we began to prepare for the acquisition of pro dentec and the transition to a national sales force that would provide us with the opportunity to sell vizilite plus directly to dentists 
we focused our fourth quarter sales and marketing efforts toward vizilite plus adoption and integration within dental practices resulting in continued increased in acceptance  growth and repeat orders by dental offices from dental distributors 
however  we made deliberate reductions in sales to our existing distribution channel as we prepared for modifying our means of distribution 
the upward trend of quarterly vizilite vizilite plus revenues generated during the preceding seven quarters was disrupted by these strategic measures 
gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was for fiscal compared to for fiscal primarily as a result of incentives offered to dentists in support of vizilite plus as well as one time costs of certain tblue tm swabs provided to existing vizilite users upon the launch of vizilite plus 
marketing and selling expenses as a percentage of net revenues were and  for fiscal and  respectively 
marketing and selling expenses for fiscal and were million and million  which represent an increase of 
marketing and selling expenses increased for fiscal as we introduced vizilite plus with tblue tm in the second quarter and as we executed our strategy to establish vizilite plus as the standard of care for oral abnormality screening 
general and administrative expenses were million  or of net revenues  for fiscal  compared to million  or of net revenue  for fiscal cost reduction measures undertaken during the year were offset by increased expenses related primarily to i additional professional  business development and consulting fees  ii the addition of senior leadership personnel  iii growth in support functions for our regulatory program and for our vizilite product line and stock compensation expense recognized under sfas no 
r 
research and development expenses increased  to million for fiscal from million in fiscal research and development expenses are comprised primarily of costs for the oratest regulatory program 
we incurred higher expense levels in fiscal with the commencement of a new phase iii clinical trial in the second fiscal quarter  with the continued efforts of our oratest regulatory program  and with the re commissioning of our manufacturing facility 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased  to million for fiscal from million for fiscal the increased level of depreciation and amortization expense in fiscal is primarily related to depreciation and amortization relative to additions of property and equipment and patents and trademarks 
other expense was million for fiscal compared to less than million of other income for fiscal the increase in other expense relates to new borrowings in fiscal resulting in a significant increase in interest expense 
in addition to the stated interest due on the secured term loan facility  interest expense included the amortization of debt issue costs and debt discount that resulted from the issuance of a stock purchase warrant in connection with that facility 
inflation and seasonality inflation has had no unique or material effect on the operations or financial condition of our businesses 
historically  our consolidated operations are not considered seasonal in nature 
liquidity and capital resources overview historically  our liquidity needs arise from working capital requirements  the funding of our research and development program  the launch of our new products  acquisitions and debt service 
we have traditionally met these cash requirements through our cash and cash equivalents  financing transactions  cash from operations  working capital management  the sale of non core operations and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock option and stock purchase programs 
our research and development program required the 
table of contents commitment of substantial resources to conduct the time consuming research and development  clinical studies and regulatory activities necessary to bring any potential product to market and to establish production  marketing and sales capabilities 
as more fully described above  we evaluated the strategic direction of the company  including an assessment of the oratest regulatory program  and we believe that in order to maximize shareholder value our resources must be directed to those products and programs with the greatest probability of financial return 
further  we believe that our greatest potential lies within the synergies created with the acquisition of pro dentec  which increases our ability to develop and commercialize our already existing oral cancer screening product  vizilite plus 
our analysis concluded that the incremental market potential of oratest  considering the availability of vizilite plus  does not justify the cost  time and uncertain study outcomes associated with continuing the program in its current form 
in order to pursue our strategy with our currently available funds  we believe that it is necessary to reduce future research and development expenditures on the oratest regulatory program 
additionally  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we took actions to streamline our operations and reduce overhead expenditures by approximately million annually 
with our cost reduction measures and with the anticipated growth in vizilite plus and our other core products  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents along with cash flows generated from operations and working capital management will allow us to fund our planned operations over the next months 
selected cash flow and working capital information is set forth in the table below dollars in thousands for the years ended july  net cash used in operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities as of july  cash and cash equivalents working capital current ratio at july   our primary sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents of million compared to million as of july  our working capital was million as of july  compared to negative million as of july  the improvement in cash and cash equivalents and in working capital at the end of fiscal resulted primarily from the net proceeds received from the private placements of debt and equity and the dispositions of the nutraceuticals business unit and our peridex product line 
also  at july   working capital was negatively affected by the classification of debt of million net of discount as a current obligation 
our current ratio has improved to as of july  compared to as of july   primarily as a result of the working capital improvements outlined above 
operating activities net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease for fiscal resulted from the reduced cash loss from continuing operations as a result of the pro dentec acquisition and a reduced cash loss from discontinued operations as a result of the disposition of the nutraceuticals business unit and peridex product line 
additionally  reduced levels of inventory and accounts receivable through the disposition of the nutraceuticals business unit and increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities resulting from the pro dentec acquisition provided working capital improvements of approximately million over the prior year period 
net cash used in operating activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the increase for fiscal resulted primarily from the funding of our operating loss  the increase in inventory arising from lower than anticipated sales levels  a decrease in our accounts payable and accrued liabilities and 
table of contents business development costs related to the disposition of the nutraceuticals business unit and acquisition of pro dentec 
these uses were offset primarily by i non cash items related primarily to depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation and financing costs and discounts related to our credit facility  and ii a decrease in accounts receivable of million 
investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million for fiscal compared to net cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal significant components of cash provided by investing activities during fiscal included net proceeds of million and million for the dispositions of the nutraceuticals business unit and peridex product line  respectively 
collateral returned upon the retirement of the industrial revenue bonds also provided million 
separately  we used million to acquire pro dentec

capital expenditures for property and equipment were million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal our capital expenditures were directed toward investments in i an improved ester c production and development capability at our former nutraceuticals business unit and ii preparations for commercialization of tblue tm and oratest in the biotechnology business unit 
separately  the fiscal results include million of net proceeds associated with the zilactin disposition and million for proceeds from the sale of short term investments 
financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease in cash provided by financing activities in fiscal relates to the repayment of the credit facility  the industrial development revenue bonds and equipment and mortgage notes of pro dentec 
offsetting these payments are gross proceeds from the private placements of million 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal proceeds from the term loan under our credit facility were the primary source of funds in fiscal  while the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and exercised stock options provided funds in both years 
short term borrowings under our previous line of credit with wells fargo bank provided funding during fiscal on march   we repaid million outstanding under the wells fargo line of credit with proceeds from the new term loan 
private placements on november   we entered into two separate purchase agreements that  in the aggregate  provided for the sale of common stock  warrants and convertible notes for an aggregate gross purchase price of approximately million collectively  the private placements 
the private placements closed and funded on november and  we used the net proceeds of the private placements to fund the pro dentec acquisition and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
pursuant to the first purchase agreement  we issued and sold i million shares of common stock for per share the shares  ii approximately million in aggregate principal amount of unsecured convertible notes the unsecured notes  which converted into million shares the unsecured note shares of zila s common stock at a conversion price of per share on december   the date on which our stockholders approved  among other things  the private placements

roth capital partners  llc roth served as placement agent in the transaction and received warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share the roth warrants 
additionally  we paid roth cash fees of million at the closing of the private placements and on february   after negotiation  we issued  shares of our common stock to roth as well as the roth warrants in final settlement of the fees 
as more fully described in notes and to our consolidated financial statements  on august   subsequent to our fiscal year end  we reached an agreement with certain investors in the private placements to restructure their holdings and provide relief from certain financial and non financial covenants contained in the secured notes 
as more fully described elsewhere in this filing  these investors  and one other  had also previously disputed the extent of certain registration rights granted in connection with the securities issued in the private placements 
in an effort to resolve the aforementioned dispute and to obtain covenant relief  zila and certain of the investors with whom we had the dispute  agreed to take certain actions and restructure the investors holdings the restructuring 
as part of the restructuring  on august   zila entered into an amendment agreement the amendment agreement with visium balanced offshore fund  ltd  visium balanced fund  lp  visium long bias offshore fund  ltd  visium long bias fund  lp  and atlas master fund  ltd 
collectively  the investors  which provides for  among other things  the following i zila repurchased  unsecured note shares from the investors for approximately million in cash  at a price based on the average closing bid price of our common stock for the ten trading days prior to august   or per unsecured note share  ii zila repurchased  secured note warrants from the investors for approximately million in cash  at a price based on a black scholes valuation or per secured note warrant  iii zila and the investors agreed to amend and restate the secured notes the amended and restated secured notes on the terms set forth below and in notes and  and iv zila paid the investors a million fee 
we believe that the restructuring strengthens our cash position by relaxing the minimum cash and ebitda covenants and allows future interest to be paid in kind with common stock

in connection with the restructuring and the issuance of the amended and restated secured notes  zila also received waivers from the required majority of the holders of the initial warrants  additional warrants and secured note warrants waiving any antidilution rights to which any holder of such warrants would otherwise be entitled in connection with the issuance of any shares as payment for interest on the amended and restated secured notes 
also  on august   zila and the investors entered into a registration rights agreement the registration rights agreement  which is described further in note  however  a registration rights dispute remains with one investor 
separately  a side letter that imposed certain corporate governance obligations on the company  the most notable of which that had not yet been fulfilled was to appoint two additional directors to the company s board of directors  was terminated 
credit facility on march   we  certain of our domestic subsidiaries and bdcf  as the initial lender and administrative agent  entered into the credit facility 
on october   debt outstanding under the credit facility in the amount of approximately million plus accrued interest was repaid from the proceeds of the disposition of the nutraceuticals business unit and the credit facility was terminated 
upon termination of the credit facility  we recognized a non cash loss of approximately million for the write off of unamortized debt financing costs and debt discount 
these costs were recorded as interest expense 
industrial development revenue bonds on september   as a requirement of the nutraceuticals disposition  we redeemed industrial development revenue bonds in the amount of million plus accrued interest 
funds in a restricted cash collateral account were utilized for this repayment 
the balance of the restricted cash collateral was returned to zila 
upon the retirement of the bonds  we recognized a loss of approximately million for the write off of the unamortized deferred financing costs 
these bonds were included in long term assets of discontinued operations at july  pharmabio investment in december  we entered into an agreement with pharmabio development  inc pharmabio  the strategic investment group of quintiles transnational corp  our contract research organization 
under this agreement  pharmabio invested million in us 
in return for the investment  we agreed to pay pharmabio an amount equal to of all net sales of the oratest product in the european union and the united states 
the aggregate amount of the royalty payments cannot exceed million and the royalty is payable quarterly 
the investment was recorded as long term debt and will be amortized using the effective interest method 
preferred stock on february   we issued  shares of series b convertible preferred stock preferred stock as part of the ist acquisition 
the holders of the preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends at a rate of per share per fiscal quarter  payable in arrears 
the preferred stock dividends were  each year during fiscal  and at july   accumulated accrued dividends are  the preferred stock can be redeemed at our option if our common stock maintains a closing price on each trading day equal to or greater than per share for any ten trading day period

ebitda we utilize ebitda defined as earnings loss before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization to monitor compliance with the covenants contained in our amended and restated secured notes  some of which are based on ebitda 
although we use ebitda as a financial measure to monitor compliance with debt covenants  it does not include certain material costs  expenses  and other items necessary to operate our business 
because ebitda does not include these items  a stockholder  potential investor or other user of our financial information should not consider this non gaap financial measure as a substitute for net cash used in operating activities or as the sole indicator of our financial performance since net cash used in operating activities provides a more complete measure of our performance 
the following is a reconciliation of ebitda to gaap measures unaudited in thousands for the years ended july  ebitda interest income interest expense income tax expense amortization of financing costs amortization of debt discounts non cash interest on term loan non cash derivative income expense gain loss from disposition of discontinued operations loss on sale of assets non cash research and development expense non cash stock based compensation expense non cash charge for options issued to outside parties other non cash items net changes in operating assets and liabilities trade receivables inventories prepaid expenses and other assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities net cash used in operating activities

however  at our option  interest payments can be made at an annual rate in shares of our common stock at a price equal to of the average closing bid price of such common stock for the trading days immediately prior to the relevant interest payment date 
purchase obligations include contractual arrangements that are legally binding and enforceable 
these contractual arrangements specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  pricing provisions and the approximate timing of the transaction 
the timing of payments for our purchase obligations is estimated based upon current information 
the actual timing and amount of payment may differ from this estimate 
purchase orders for raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the above table 
our purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than definitive binding contractual obligations 
contractual arrangements for goods and services that contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty are not included in the above table 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates related to sales allowances  chargebacks  rebates  returns and other pricing adjustments  depreciation and amortization and other contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors related to each circumstance 
actual results could differ from those estimates based upon future events  which could include  among other risks  changes in the business environment in which we operate and changes in the regulations governing the manner in which we sell our products 
there are several accounting policies that we believe are significant to the presentation of our consolidated financial statements and require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to our consolidated financial statements nature of business activities  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies summarizes each of our significant accounting policies 
we believe our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition revenue from sales of products is recognized when earned  that is  when the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  upon delivery to the designated carrier 
cash discounts  sales incentives  and returns are estimated and recognized as a reduction of revenue at the time of sale based upon historical experience and current customer commitments 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis and revise them as necessary 
we provide for allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns based on historical experience and a review of our receivables 
receivables are presented net of allowances for doubtful accounts and for sales 
table of contents returns of  and  as of july  and  respectively 
we evaluate these estimates on a quarterly basis and revise them as necessary 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america necessarily requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include i useful lives of intangibles  ii impairment analyses  iii depreciable lives of assets  iv income tax valuation allowances  v contingency and litigation reserves  vi inventory valuation  vii allowances for accounts receivable  cash discounts  sales incentives and sales returns  and viii valuation assumptions for share based payments 
we make changes in estimates as appropriate  and as we become aware of circumstances surrounding those estimates 
such changes and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations in the period in which the changes are made and  if material  their effects are disclosed in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets we have made acquisitions of products and businesses that include goodwill  license agreements  patents and trademarks  product rights and other intangible and long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually  and for other intangibles and long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of any of these assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances might include a significant decline in market share and or significant negative industry or economic trends  a significant decline in profits and or significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  rapid changes in technology  significant litigation or other items 
in evaluating the recoverability of goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets  our policy is to compare the carrying amounts of such assets with the estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows 
if we have changes in events or circumstances  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest of certain assets  certain assets could be impaired which would result in a charge to earnings 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
topic n  quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  sab no 

sab no 
addresses how the effect of prior year uncorrected misstatements should be considered when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab no 
requires sec registrants i to quantify misstatements using a combined approach which considers both the balance sheet and income statement approaches  ii to evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying an error that is material in light of relevant quantitative and qualitative factors  and iii to adjust their financial statements if the new combined approach results in a conclusion that an error is material 
sab no 
addresses the mechanics of correcting misstatements that include effects from prior years 
it indicates that the current year correction of a material error that includes prior year effects may result in the need to correct prior year financial statements even if the misstatement in the prior year or years is considered immaterial 
any prior year financial statements found to be materially misstated in years originating subsequent to the issuance of sab no 
 the prior year financial statements requiring restatement would be restated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
because the combined approach represents a change in practice  the sec staff will not require registrants that followed an acceptable approach in the past to restate prior years historical financial statements 
rather  these registrants can report the cumulative effect of adopting the new approach as an adjustment to the current year s beginning balance of retained earnings 
if the new approach is adopted in a quarter other than the first quarter  financial statements for prior interim periods within the year of adoption may need to be restated 
sab is effective for any report for an interim period of the first fiscal period 
table of contents ending after november  the adoption of sab did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measures sfas no 

sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  expands disclosures about fair value measurements  and applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements 
however  the fasb anticipates that for some entities  the application of sfas no 
will change current practice 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   which for us will be our fiscal year beginning august  we are currently evaluating the impact of sfas no 
to determine whether its adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes detailed guidance for the financial statement recognition  measurement and disclosure of uncertain tax positions recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
tax positions must meet a more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date to be recognized upon the adoption of fin and in subsequent periods 
fin will be effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and the provisions of fin will be applied to all tax positions upon initial adoption of the interpretation  which for us will be our fiscal year beginning august  the cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation will be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for that fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of fin to determine whether its adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and sfas no 

this standard amends the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
specifically  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to permit fair value re measurement for any hybrid financial instrument with an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  provided the whole instrument is accounted for on a fair value basis 
additionally  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to allow a qualifying special purpose entity to hold a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
sfas no 
applies to all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september   which for us will be our fiscal year beginning august   with early application allowed 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact to our results of operations or financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

sfas no 
permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain items at fair value 
the objective of this standard is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reporting earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
sfas no 
permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
entities will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option i may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments accounted for by the equity method  ii is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and iii is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november   which for us would be our fiscal year beginning august  we are currently evaluating whether to adopt sfas no 
in december  the fasb issued fsp eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements fsp eitf  which addresses accounting for registration payment arrangements 
fsp eitf specifies that the contingent obligation to make future payments or otherwise transfer consideration under a registration payment arrangement  whether issued as a separate agreement or included as 
table of contents a provision of a financial instrument or other agreement  should be separately recognized and measured in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
fsp eitf further clarifies that a financial instrument subject to a registration payment arrangement should be accounted for in accordance with other applicable generally accepted accounting principles without regard to the contingent obligation to transfer consideration pursuant to the registration payment 
fsp eitf is effective immediately for registration payment arrangements and the financial instruments subject to those arrangements that are entered into or modified subsequent to december  for registration payment arrangements and related financial instruments entered into prior to december   fsp eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those financial years 
companies are required to report transition through a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the first interim period for the fiscal year in which fsp eitf is adopted 
as described more fully in notes and  in march  we entered into a debt agreement that required issuance of a warrant to purchase million shares of our common stock 
as required under the debt agreement  we registered the common shares underlying the warrant with the securities and exchange commission sec and must maintain such registration over the term of the warrant 
at the time of issuance  the obligation created by our agreement to register and maintain registration of the underlying common shares was recorded as a warrant liability measured at fair value 
we determined the fair value of the warrant based on available market data using a black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of the warrant was recorded as a debt discount amortizable as interest expense over the life of the debt using the effective interest method 
any gains or losses resulting from the changes in fair value of the warrant liability from period to period are included as non cash credits or charges to earnings 
as permitted under fsp eitf  we elected early adoption as of the beginning of our fiscal quarter beginning november  at such time  we recorded the effect of applying fsp eitf to our derivative liability for the bcdf warrant using the cumulative effect transition method  which resulted in a decrease in derivative liability of approximately million and an increase to the carrying amount of additional paid in capital of approximately million  representing the original value assigned to the warrants with an offsetting cumulative effect entry to accumulated deficit of approximately million  as set forth in our consolidated statements of shareholders equity 
the cumulative adjustment is not recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and prior periods are not adjusted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk with the redemption of the industrial development revenue bonds on september   our exposure to market risk for a change in interest rates relates primarily to our investments  which consists of cash and cash equivalents 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
we maintain our portfolio in high credit quality money market funds and the carrying value at july  approximates market value and at maturity 
because our investments consist of cash equivalents  a hypothetical basis point change in interest rates is not likely to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we also have market risk arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates through our subsidiaries that conduct business in canada and europe and through a subsidiary that uses the british pound as its functional currency 
we believe that such exposure does not present a significant risk due to the limited number of transactions and or accounts denominated in foreign currency
