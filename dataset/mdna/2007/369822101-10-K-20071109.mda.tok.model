johnson  our chief operating officer  on april  critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we re evaluate all of our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions as additional information becomes available in future periods 
management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to critical accounting estimates in this transitional report 
we believe the following are the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for the issuances of stock options  we follow the fair value provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
r  share based payment 
sfas no 
r requires recognition of employee share based compensation expense in the statements of income over the vesting period based on the fair value of the stock option at the grant date 
the pricing model we use for determining fair values of the purchase option and the embedded derivative is the black scholes pricing model 
valuations derived from this model are subject to ongoing internal and external verification and review 
the model uses market sourced inputs such as interest rates  market prices and volatilities 
selection of these inputs involves management s judgment and may impact net income 
in particular  the company uses volatility rates based upon a sample of comparable companies in royal wolf s industry and a risk free interest rate  which is the rate on u 
s 
treasury instruments  for a security with a maturity that approximates the estimated remaining contractual life of the derivative
