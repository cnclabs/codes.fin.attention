corporate overview the operations of frisch s restaurants  inc and subsidiaries the company consist of two reportable segments within the restaurant industry full service family style big boy restaurants and grill buffet style golden corral restaurants 
as of may   big boy restaurants and golden corral restaurants were owned and operated by the company  located in various regions of ohio  kentucky and indiana  plus smaller areas in pennsylvania and west virginia 
fiscal year ended on tuesday  may  it compares with fiscal year that ended on tuesday  may   and fiscal year that ended on sunday  may  all of these years consisted of weeks thirteen periods of weeks each 
however  fiscal year included an additional two days days to effect a change in the year end from the sunday nearest to the last day of may to the nearest tuesday 
fiscal year will end on tuesday  june   a period of weeks 
revenue of   and  was achieved in fiscal year  fiscal year and fiscal year  respectively 
the extra two days in fiscal year contributed  in additional revenue 
fiscal year marked the end of seven consecutive years of record revenue 
the lower revenue was largely the result of opening no new golden corral restaurants during the year  plus a series of winter storms in the third quarter that adversely affected same store sales performance 
net earnings for fiscal year were  or diluted earnings per share eps of 
net earnings in fiscal year were  diluted eps and  diluted eps was posted in fiscal year however  the results for fiscal year profited significantly from a  non taxable life insurance benefit amounting to 
diluted eps 
without the effect of the life insurance benefit  net earnings and diluted eps for fiscal year were  and  respectively 
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas r  share based payment on may  sfas r requires the fair value of stock options granted to be recognized as compensation cost 
it applies to all stock option awards granted on or after the adoption date  with compensation cost based on the fair value of the award on the date of the grant 
the cost is recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
in addition  because the company elected to use the modified prospective application transition method in adopting sfas r  compensation cost is also recognized for the portion of outstanding options vesting in the period that were granted prior to  but not yet vested  as of the adoption date 
compensation cost associated with sfas r is included in administrative and advertising expense in the consolidated statement of earnings 
as a result  earnings before income taxes were  lower in fiscal year than if the company were permitted 
table of contents to continue accounting for stock options using the intrinsic method of measuring stock based compensation as had been prescribed under the old accounting rules

funded status is measured as the difference between plan assets at fair value and projected benefit obligations pbo  which includes a projection of future salary increases 
the fair value of plan assets exceeded pbo as of may   the result of very favorable returns on the plans equity investments during fiscal year to lower the value of prepaid pension costs that had been booked under the old accounting standard to the excess of plan assets over pbo  a  reduction in the company s equity  net of tax  was required  effected through a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income 
in november  ohio voters approved a mandate to annually increase the state s minimum wage 
known as issue  the following mandates were added to the ohio constitution effective january  the minimum wage was increased percent from per hour to per hour 
the minimum wage for tipped employees increased percent from per hour to per hour 
all minimum wage rates will be automatically adjusted annually for inflation based on changes in the consumer price index 
as more than two thirds of the company s payroll costs are incurred in ohio  it is estimated that the first full calendar year s effect will add more than  to the company s operating costs 
in response  the company increased its menu prices in early january as follows percent for big boy and percent for golden corral 
the price increases were designed to also incorporate the regular semi annual price changes that would have been implemented anyway in february effective july   the federal minimum wage increases from per hour to per hour for non tipped employees  increasing to per hour in july and to per hour in july the minimum wage for tipped employees will remain at per hour 
minimum wage legislation in kentucky is identical to the federal legislation except that it was effective in june the near term effect of the federal and kentucky legislation will be minimal  as market conditions already dictate wage rates in excess of per hour 
results of operations sales the company s sales are primarily generated through the operation of big boy restaurants and golden corral restaurants 
big boy sales also include wholesale sales from the company s commissary to restaurants licensed to other big boy operators and the sale of big boy s signature brand tartar sauce to grocery stores 
same store sales comparisons are a key metric that management uses in the operation of the business 
same store sales are affected by changes in customer counts and menu price increases 
changes in sales also occur as new restaurants are opened and older restaurants are closed

year fiscal year fiscal year fiscal marked the tenth consecutive year that big boy same store sales increases have been achieved 
sales were higher at the drive thru window  but lower in the dining room 
higher average guest checks driven by menu price increases had a positive effect on the sales improvement 
however  it is believed the higher prices charged likely contributed to a reduction in customer counts 
continued steep gasoline prices throughout the last three fiscal years are believed to be an additional cause of sustained lower customer counts  as the higher cost to fill up a tank leaves many consumers with less money available to spend on a restaurant meal 
the same store sales comparisons include average menu price increases of percent  percent  and percent  respectively  during the third quarters of fiscal years  and the percent increase in the third quarter of fiscal included a specific provision to offset costs associated with minimum wage increases 
the first quarters of fiscal years  and included average menu price increases of percent  percent  and percent  respectively 
another price increase will likely be implemented in late summer the company operated big boy restaurants as of may   a net reduction of one since the beginning of the three year period that began may  the count of includes one that opened in july which relocated a restaurant lost in an eminent domain proceeding to a superior site  plus one that opened in october  which also relocated an older facility to a superior site within the same local trade area 
the combined sales of the two relocated restaurants in fiscal year were percent higher than sales at the old locations 
the count of big boy restaurants also includes the effect of closing two low volume restaurants one in january  the other in april and an aging restaurant facility in the cincinnati market that was razed in april to make way for a replacement structure on the same site  which should be ready to open in late august not included in the count are two new big boy restaurants one in dayton  ohio  the other in springfield  ohio that opened respectively in june and july the count also does not include a low volume restaurant that was closed in june an existing big boy is currently scheduled to be razed in the spring of to be replaced with a new building on the same site 
several other new sites are currently being evaluated for potential acquisition and development 
golden corral sales in fiscal year were lower than the comparable year ago period 
no new golden corral restaurants were opened during fiscal year  and same store sales continued to decline 
prior to fiscal year  the effects of having more golden corral restaurants in operation than the corresponding year ago periods would result in a sales increase  despite same store sales decreases 
absolute sales in fiscal year decreased approximately million or percent lower than fiscal year  despite the fact that fiscal year had more sales weeks than did fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year in operation at beginning of year opened during the year in operation at end of year total sales weeks during year one golden corral restaurant was under construction as of may  it opened for business in july no golden corral restaurants are currently under construction 
following general industry practice  the same store sales comparisons in the table that follows uses a formula that includes only those restaurants that were open for five full fiscal quarters prior to the start of the comparison periods 
this removes possible misleading 
table of contents numbers that can be caused by the great influx of customers during the first several months of operation  sometimes called the honeymoon period of a new restaurant

year fiscal fiscal fiscal year marked the third consecutive year of same store sales declines  and fourteen of the last fifteen quarters 
higher average guest checks driven by menu price increases were not enough to offset lower customer counts 
as with big boy  it is believed the higher prices charged likely contributed to a reduction in customer counts  as did the continued high cost of gasoline 
also  same store customer counts were percent lower during the third quarter of fiscal year when compared with the third quarter of fiscal year  largely the result of a series of winter storms in most of the company s operating regions during the month of february golden corral menu prices were increased percent in september  
percent in february  percent in may and percent in may prices were further increased by percent in january to offset the effects of higher costs that have resulted from increases in the minimum wage 
gross profit gross profit for the big boy segment includes wholesale sales and cost of wholesale sales 
gross profit differs from restaurant level profit discussed in note g segment information to the consolidated financial statements  as advertising expense is charged against restaurant level profit 
gross profit for both operating segments is shown below 
fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year in thousands big boy gross profit golden corral gross profit total gross profit the operating percentages shown in the following table are percentages of total sales  including big boy wholesale sales 
the table supplements the discussion that follows which addresses cost of sales for both the big boy and golden corral reporting segments  including food cost  payroll and other operating costs 
total bb gc total bb gc total bb gc sales food and paper payroll and related other operating costs including opening costs gross profit 
table of contents food cost percentages in the golden corral segment are much higher than big boy because of the all you can eat nature of the golden corral segment  as well as its use of steak as an item featured daily on the buffet 
notwithstanding the rising cost of various commodities  the improvements in food cost percentages continue to be driven largely by higher menu prices charged to customers 
beef is a highly volatile market  as import and export restrictions can cause wide fluctuations in cost 
harsh winter storms in the nation s central plains adversely affected feedlot inventories  the result of which was much higher beef prices through the end of may middle meat prices have declined somewhat entering the summer months 
the effect of changing commodity prices is actively managed with changes to the big boy menu mix and effective selection of items served on the golden corral food bar 
however  escalating costs of poultry  pork  fish and dairy products can be problematic to effective menu management  particularly in the big boy segment 
higher wage costs associated with mandated minimum wage increases were largely countered by the effects of management s decision to raise menu prices  as evidenced by the percentages in the preceding table 
although there is no seasonal fluctuation in employment levels  hours worked are managed closely according to restaurant sales patterns 
the significant improvement in golden corral s payroll and payroll related costs for fiscal year was achieved through a renewed concentration on reducing labor hours worked relative to sales 
payroll related costs include statutory provisions for social security  unemployment and workers compensation  along with voluntary benefits provided by the company such as defined benefit pension plans and medical insurance 
the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
initial self insurance reserves are accrued based on prior claims history  including an amount developed for incurred but unreported claims 
active management of claims together with post accident drug testing in recent years have effected vast improvements in claims experience by lowering both the number of claims and the average cost per claim 
management performs a comprehensive review each fiscal quarter and adjusts the self insurance reserves as deemed appropriate based on claims experience 
favorable adjustments were   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and because of the improvements in claims experience  lower rates as a percentage of payroll to accrue initial reserves have been in place since fiscal year the lower rates should effect a continuation in the trend of reducing the size of future quarterly adjustments 
although pension costs have remained fairly steady over the past three years  the costs are at historically high levels after many years of very reasonable costs 
investment returns on equity investments held by the trust that governs the defined benefit pension plans can and do affect the costs to a great extent 
net periodic pension cost computed under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and pension cost for fiscal year is currently estimated at  the decline due principally to the combination of favorable asset returns and favorable pay experience 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to compute pension cost was percent in fiscal  lowered from percent used in each of the two prior years 
the assumption will remain at percent for the determination of pension costs for fiscal year the weighted average discount rate mirrors movement in the underlying markets and is considered a snapshot rate reflecting current market conditions 
the discount rate used in the actuarial assumptions to compute pension costs was percent in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year and was percent in fiscal year the rate for fiscal year will be percent 
the rate of compensation increase for pension costs was percent in fiscal year and in fiscal year  down from percent in fiscal year it will remain at percent for fiscal year cash contributions made by the company to these plans were   and  respectively  during fiscal years  and contributions for fiscal year are currently estimated at  other operating costs include occupancy costs such as maintenance  rent  depreciation  property tax  insurance and utilities  field supervision  accounting and payroll preparation costs  franchise fees for golden corral restaurants  opening costs and many other restaurant operating expenses 
most of these expenses tend to be fixed  therefore  same store sales decreases cause these costs to be a higher percentage of sales  as can be seen in the above table for golden corral 
opening costs also have a significant impact on the percentages as well 
opening cost charges for big boy restaurants for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
golden corral opening costs for fiscal years  and were   and  respectively 
golden corral opening costs should remain low in fiscal year as only one new restaurants is currently expected to open 

table of contents other operating costs in fiscal year were adversely impacted by a  charge to correct the company s accounting for leases  which was conformed to recognize rent expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  including any option periods considered to be part of the lease term  as lease terms are defined by statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases  as amended 
operating profit to arrive at the measure of operating profit  administrative and advertising expense is subtracted from gross profit  while franchise fees and other revenue is added to it 
gains and losses on sale of real property  if any  are then respectively added or subtracted 
administrative and advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and advertising expense represents the largest component of these costs 
spending for advertising and marketing programs is proportionate to sales levels  reflecting the company s long standing policy to spend a constant percentage of big boy and golden corral sales on advertising and marketing 
advertising expense was   and  respectively in fiscal years  and all other administrative costs were   and  respectively in fiscal years  and fiscal year included  in stock based compensation costs directly attributable to the adoption of sfas r 
revenue from franchise fees is based on sales of big boy restaurants that are licensed to other operators 
the fees are based principally on percentages of sales generated by the licensed restaurants and are recorded on the accrual method as earned 
as of may   big boy restaurants licensed to other operators were paying franchise fees to the company 
no licensed big boy restaurants opened or closed during fiscal year or fiscal year three licensed restaurants ceased operating in fiscal year other revenue also includes certain other fees from licensed restaurants along with miscellaneous rent and investment income 
gains and losses on sale of assets consist of transactions involving real property and sometimes may include restaurant equipment that is sold together with real property as a package when closed restaurants are sold 
gains and losses reported on this line do not include abandonment losses that often arise when certain equipment is replaced before it reaches the end of its expected life 
abandonment losses are instead reported in other operating costs 
the sale of an older big boy restaurant was completed shortly after the restaurant ceased operating in october the resulting  gain was reported on the line gain on sale of assets in fiscal year the amount reported on the same line in fiscal year resulted principally from a gain in connection with an eminent domain proceeding 
substantially all of the amount reported for fiscal year arose from a gain on the sale of undeveloped land 
no significant charges for impairments of assets were recorded during any of the three years in the period ended may  other expense income interest expense was   and  respectively  in fiscal years  and without the benefit of the  debt retirement in march  which was provided from life insurance benefits  interest expense for fiscal year would have been at least  higher 
while variable interest rates inched higher in fiscal year  a lower overall debt load resulted in the reduction of interest expense 
in addition to interest expense  a  non taxable life insurance benefit in fiscal year was classified as other expense income  and is not included in the determination of operating profit 
income taxes income tax expense as a percentage of pre tax earnings was in fiscal year  percent in fiscal year and percent in fiscal year the fiscal income tax expense percentage was favorably affected by a  gain from non taxable life insurance benefit 
the effective rate for fiscal would have been percent without the advantage of the non taxable life insurance benefit 
the effective rates have been kept consistently low through the company s use of available tax credits  principally the federal credit allowed for employer social security and medicare taxes paid on certain employee tips 
to a lesser degree  the company also uses the federal work opportunity tax credit wotc

fin  is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company s fiscal year that will end june  
fin provides guidance for recognition and measurement on financial statements of tax positions taken in tax returns or expected to be taken on a future tax return 
the company is currently evaluating the effect of applying fin liquidity and capital resources sources of funds sales to restaurant customers provide the company s principal source of cash 
the funds from sales are immediately available for the company s use  as substantially all sales to restaurant customers are received in cash or are settled by debit or credit cards 
net earnings plus depreciation supply the primary source of cash provided by operating activities 
other sources of cash may include borrowing against credit lines  proceeds received when stock options are exercised and occasional sales of real estate 
in addition to servicing debt  these cash flows are utilized for discretionary objectives  including capital projects principally restaurant expansion and dividends 
working capital practices the company has historically maintained a strategic negative working capital position  a common practice in the restaurant industry 
as significant cash flows are consistently provided by operations  and credit lines are readily available  the use of this practice should not hinder the company s ability to satisfactorily retire any of its obligations when due  including the aggregated contractual obligations and commercial commitments shown in the following table 
aggregated information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of may  payments due by period in thousands more than years total year year year year year long term debt      rent due under capital lease obligations   rent due under operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations    other long term obligations  total contractual cash obligations    not included in the table is a secondary liability for the performance of a ground lease that has been assigned to a third party

table of contents the working capital deficit was  as of may  the deficit was  as of may  the increase in the working capital deficit reflects a higher levels of accounts payable  primarily for three big boys and one golden corral that were under construction as of may   b a larger portion of long term debt due within one year  and c residual value guarantees on certain capital leases are now due in less than one year 
including draws since may    remains available to be borrowed under the terms of a construction draw credit facility  which expires september   unless extended 
additionally   remains available on a working capital revolving line of credit through september   if needed 
operating activities operating cash flows were  in fiscal year   higher than fiscal year and  higher than fiscal year included in operating cash flows are normal changes in assets and liabilities such as prepaid expenses  inventories and accounts payable  all of which can and often do fluctuate widely 
management believes a better  more reliable gauge to measure cash flows from the operation of the business is to use the simple method of net earnings plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  losses net of any gains on dispositions of assets and stock based compensation expense 
the result of this method is reflected as a sub total in the consolidated statement of cash flows  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year life insurance benefit excluded 
investing activities capital spending is the principal component of investing activities 
capital spending was  during fiscal year this year s capital spending includes  for golden corral restaurants and  for big boy restaurants 
the spending is indicative of management s shift to an emphasis on big boy development 
these capital expenditures consisted of new restaurant construction  site acquisitions for expansion  the acquisition in fee simple of existing restaurant facilities pursuant to purchase option provisions in lease agreements  remodeling existing restaurants including kitchen redesigns and dining room expansions  routine equipment replacements and other capital outlays 
proceeds from the disposition of property during fiscal year amounted to  including  from the sale of a big boy restaurant that closed in october three low volume big boy restaurants that respectively ceased operations in january  april and june are expected to be sold in the near term  the aggregate proceeds from which should amount to just under million 
proceeds from dispositions of property in fiscal year consisted of the sale of two pieces of land that the company had originally intended to develop that ultimately proved to be not viable  plus proceeds from an eminent domain proceeding 
investing activities for fiscal year included the receipt of claims for life insurance benefits totaling  that were associated with the death of the company s chairman of the board in february financing activities borrowing against credit lines amounted to  during fiscal year another  was borrowed shortly after the year ended 
scheduled and other payments of long term debt and capital lease obligations amounted to  during fiscal year payment of long term debt and capital lease obligations in fiscal year included  that was paid with the life insurance proceeds discussed above under investing activities 
regular quarterly cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled  in fiscal year as the company expects to continue its year practice of paying regular quarterly cash dividends  the board of directors declared another 
per share dividend on june  that was paid on july  to shareholders of record on june  during fiscal year  employees acquired approximately  shares of the company s common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options  yielding proceeds to the company of approximately  as of may    shares granted under the company s two stock option plans remain outstanding  including  fully vested shares at a weighted average price per share of 
as of may   approximately  shares remained available to be granted under these plans 
other information as of may   golden corral restaurants were in operation 
the company s th golden corral restaurant opened in july  the first new restaurant to be opened since november as of may   the cost remaining to complete the project was  the company has the approval of golden corral franchising systems  inc to curtail development of golden corral restaurants until operating performance levels improve in existing restaurants 
the curtailment allows the company to use cash flows and credit facilities in a manner that strengthens the balance sheet and keeps interest costs in check  while allowing operations to focus on rebuilding declining same store sales 

table of contents the company continues to possess development rights for up to more golden corral restaurants 
aside from the restaurant that opened in july  no other golden corral restaurants are currently planned to open in fiscal year current plans call for continuing to search for cost effective sites for future development 
in the meantime  five existing golden corral restaurants will be renovated during fiscal year at an average cost of  per restaurant 
renovations of five golden corral restaurants were completed in fiscal year a big boy restaurant that opened for business in october was the relocation to a superior site of an older facility within the same market 
a big boy restaurant that opened in july was the relocation  also to a superior site  of a restaurant that was lost in an eminent domain proceeding 
three big boy restaurants were under construction as of may   at which time the estimated cost remaining to complete these projects was  two of these restaurants subsequently opened for business in june and july  respectively 
the third is a replacement of a big boy restaurant that closed in april that is scheduled to re open in august several sites are currently being evaluated for future acquisition and development 
one existing big boy is scheduled to be razed in the spring of and replaced with a new building 
approximately one fifth of the company s big boy restaurants are routinely renovated or decoratively updated each year at an average cost of  per restaurant 
in addition  certain high volume big boy restaurants are regularly evaluated to determine whether their kitchens should be redesigned for increased efficiencies and whether an expansion of the dining room is warranted 
a typical kitchen redesign costs approximately  and a dining room expansion can cost up to including land and land improvements  the cash required to build and equip each new restaurant currently ranges from  to  for a golden corral  and from  to  for a big boy 
the actual cost depends greatly on the price paid for the land and the cost of land improvements  which can vary widely from location to location  and whether the land is purchased or leased 
no pending agreements to acquire real property were in place as of may  it is the company s policy to own the land on which it builds new restaurants  however  it is becoming more frequently necessary to enter ground leases to obtain desirable land on which to build 
eight of the golden corral restaurants in operation as of may  have been built on leased land 
three big boy restaurants opened since were also built on leased land 
all of these leases have been accounted for as operating leases pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for leases as amended 
as of may  the company occupied restaurants pursuant to leases  of which five are capital leases under the provisions of sfas three of capital leases will expire on october  and the final two will expire in may the company will likely purchase these five big boy properties at costs yet to be determined 
three big boy restaurants that had been occupied on a month to month arrangement were acquired in fee simple in september pursuant to the company s right to purchase the properties from the landlord 
the aggregate purchase price was  in addition  a big boy restaurant facility that had been occupied pursuant to an operating lease was acquired in fee simple for  in december application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to use estimates and assumptions to measure certain items that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
these judgments are based on knowledge and experience about past and current events  and assumptions about future events 
accounting estimates can and do change as new events occur and additional information becomes available 
actual results may differ markedly from current judgment 
two factors are required for an accounting policy to be deemed critical 
the policy must be significant to the fair presentation of a company s financial condition and its results of operations  and the policy must require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
the company believes the following to be its critical accounting policies 

table of contents self insurance the company self insures a significant portion of expected losses from its workers compensation program in the state of ohio 
the company purchases coverage from an insurance company for individual claims in excess of  reserves for claims expense include a provision for incurred but not reported claims 
each quarter  the company reviews claims valued by its third party administrator tpa and then applies experience and judgment to determine the most probable future value of incurred claims 
as the tpa submits additional new information  the company reviews it in light of past history of claims for similar injuries  probability of settlement  and any other facts that might provide guidance in determining ultimate value of individual claims 
unexpected changes in any of these or other factors could result in actual costs differing materially from initial projections 
pension plans pension plan accounting requires rate assumptions for future compensation increases and the long term return on plan assets 
a discount rate is also applied to the calculations of net periodic pension cost and projected benefit obligations 
an informal committee consisting of executives from the finance department and the human resources department  with guidance provided by the company s actuarial consulting firm  develops these assumptions each year 
the consulting firm also provides services in calculating estimated future obligations and net periodic pension cost 
assets of the pension plans are targeted to be invested percent in equity securities  as these investments have historically provided the greatest long term returns 
to determine the long term rate of return on plan assets  the committee looks at the target asset allocation of plan assets and determines the expected return on each asset class 
the expected returns for each asset class are combined and rounded to the nearest basis points to determine the overall expected return on assets 
the committee determines the discount rate by looking at the projected future benefit payments and matching those to spot rates based on yields of high grade corporate bonds 
a single discount rate is chosen  rounded to the nearest basis points  that produces the same present value as the various spot rates 
long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
property and equipment typically approximates to percent of the company s total assets 
judgments and estimates are used to determine the carrying value of long lived assets 
this includes the assignment of appropriate useful lives  which affect depreciation and amortization expense 
capitalization policies are continually monitored to assure they remain appropriate 
management considers a history of cash flow losses on a restaurant by restaurant basis to be the primary indicator of potential impairment 
carrying values of property and equipment are accordingly tested for impairment each quarter 
in addition  carrying values are also reviewed whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying value may be impaired 
when undiscounted expected future cash flows are less than carrying values  an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which carrying values exceed estimated realizable values 
future cash flows can be difficult to predict 
changing neighborhood demographics and economic conditions  and many other factors may impact operating performance  which affect cash flow 
estimated realizable values are provided by real estate brokers and or the company s past experience in disposing of property 
sometimes it becomes necessary to cease operating a certain restaurant due to poor performance 
the final impairment amount can be significantly different from the initial charge  particularly if the eventual market price received from the disposition of the property differs materially from initial estimates of realizable values 
acquired goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or whenever an impairment indicator arises 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has no significant market risk exposure to interest rate changes as substantially all of its debt is currently financed with fixed interest rates 
the company does not currently use derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates 
any cash equivalents maintained by the company have original maturities of three months or less 
the company does not use foreign currency 
big boy restaurants utilize centralized purchasing and food preparation provided through the company s commissary and food manufacturing plant 
the company believes the commissary operation ensures uniform product quality and safety  timeliness of distribution to restaurants and created efficiencies that ultimately result in lower food and supply costs 
the commissary operation does not supply golden corral restaurants 
commodity pricing affects the cost of many of the company s food products 
commodity pricing can be extremely volatile  affected by many factors outside the company s control  including import and export restrictions  supply versus demand  production levels and the impact of weather on crop yields 
certain commodities purchased by the commissary  principally beef  chicken  pork  dairy products  fish  french fries and coffee  are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
purchase contracts for some of these items may contain contractual provisions that limit the price to be paid 
these contracts are normally for periods of one year or less but may have longer terms if favorable long term pricing becomes available 
food supplies are generally plentiful and may be obtained from any number of suppliers  which mitigates the company s overall commodity cost risk 
quality  timeliness of deliveries and price are the principal determinants of source 
the company does not use financial instruments as a hedge against changes in commodity pricing 
except for items such as beef  bread  produce and dairy products that are purchased from any number of local suppliers  the golden corral segment of the business currently purchases substantially all food  beverage and other menu items from the same approved vendor that golden corral franchising systems  inc franchisor uses for its operations 
deliveries are made two times per week 
other vendors are available to provide products that meet the franchisor s specifications at comparable prices should the company wish or need to make a change
