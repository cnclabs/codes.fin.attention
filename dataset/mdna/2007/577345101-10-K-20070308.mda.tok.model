sales of non core property in march  we sold approximately  acres and in december we sold approximately acres of upcountry maui land as we continued towards our goal of re deploying assets to strengthen our agriculture segment operations  repositioning our resort operations and increasing investments in our community development segment 
these properties primarily consist of land that was deemed unsuitable for precision cultivation of pineapple and were also not suitable for creating new holistic communities

description of business agriculture maui pineapple company  ltd 
is the operating subsidiary for our agriculture segment 
we own and operate fully integrated facilities for the production of fresh and processed pineapple 
our current strategy is to expand our presence in the premium fresh pineapple market  while selectively reducing our reliance on the processed pineapple market 
therefore  over recent years  we have decreased the tonnage of fruit going to the cannery and  in the last few years  we began to commensurately reduce the number of markets for processed pineapple that we serve 
our strategy focuses on marketing only the highest quality fresh pineapple by using the processed pineapple operations to complement the fresh operations 
we direct fruit to either the processed or the fresh packing facility at the time of harvest based on a variety of factors  including market conditions  fruit size and fruit quality 
in  sales of fresh pineapple represented approximately of net pineapple sales compared to in and in the transition of our agriculture operations continues with an emphasis on automating many labor intensive functions and upgrading the workforce through selective training and performance based compensation programs 
planting  harvesting and seasonality the fresh fruit market is a year round business  which requires consistency of supply 
over the past two years  we have made significant progress in changing our agronomic practices and planting schedules to produce a more consistent and predictable supply of fruit throughout the year 
in addition  we have made significant progress in implementing improved crop maintenance and agronomic practices that are beginning to improve plant yields tons of fruit per acre and fruit quality 
planting and harvesting take place throughout the year 
two pineapple crops are normally harvested from each new planting 
the first  or plant crop  is harvested approximately to months after planting  the second  or ratoon crop  is harvested to months later 
a third crop  the second ratoon  may be harvested to months later depending on a number of conditions 
our processed pineapple operations have historically had a seasonal operating cycle 
the seasonality of the processing operation is not only due to the pineapple s natural tendency to ripen during the summer months  but also because the timing of initial planting and initiation of flowering can promote ripening during the summer 
during the summer months  student labor for the harvesting and processing operations is also more readily available 
as we shift our operations towards the fresh fruit market and accordingly  adjust our agronomic practices  the seasonality of the business is becoming less pronounced 
in  we expect to continue the transition of our pineapple operations with an increased emphasis on the fresh fruit market 
the seasonality of the processing operation does not specifically affect sales or earnings because sales are driven by consumer consumption and resupply orders by customers 
the availability of water for irrigation is critical to the cultivation of pineapple 
the upcountry maui area  in which we have historically grown pineapple  is susceptible to drought conditions  which can adversely affect pineapple operations by resulting in poor yields tons per acre and lower recoveries the amount of saleable product per ton of fruit processed 
a large portion of the fields in our upcountry maui plantation are equipped with drip irrigation systems 
we are also shifting more of our plantings to our west maui agricultural lands  which we have farmed for many years 
our west maui agricultural lands are less susceptible to drought conditions and additional irrigation storage capacity is also being installed 
packing and cannery facilities harvested pineapple is packed for fresh shipment at our new packing facility located in kahului  adjacent to our cannery 
the new facility  which was placed into service in june  is expected to reduce our overall cost structure by integrating and automating much of the fresh and processed fruit grading and packing operations 
pineapple that will be canned is processed at our cannery 
the cannery is located in a foreign trade zone and operates most of the year 
the metal containers used in canning pineapple are produced in a company owned can plant at the cannery site 
the metal is imported from manufacturers in japan 
a warehouse is maintained at the cannery site for inventory purposes 
products and distribution we sell fresh whole pineapple from hawaii to retail and wholesale channels in hawaii and the continental united states 
beginning in november  our fresh premium pineapple has been sold under the maui gold in addition to the hawaiian goldtm brand name 
we sell processed pineapple products primarily as private label pineapple with hawaiian usa stamped on the can lid 
our products are sold principally to large grocery chains  other food processors  wholesale grocers  the united states government and to organizations offering a complete buyers brand program to affiliated chains and wholesalers serving both retail and food service outlets 
a substantial volume of our pineapple products is marketed through food brokers  which is administered through our sales office in concord  california 
we sell pineapple juice in plastic bottles in various sizes to large grocery chains in the continental united states 
the pineapple juice ingredients are shipped in bulk from our cannery on maui to co packers on the mainland that bottle the juice to our specifications 
as a service to our customers  we maintain inventories of our products in seven public warehouses in the continental united states 
the balance of our products is shipped directly from hawaii to our customers 
our processed pineapple products are shipped from hawaii by ocean transportation and are then transported by truck or rail to customers or to public warehouses 
fresh whole pineapple is shipped by air or by ocean transportation 
in  approximately united states customers accounted for approximately of our processed and fresh pineapple sales 
sales of hawaii grown pineapple to customers located in foreign countries  primarily to japan and canada  amounted to approximately of our processed pineapple sales in  and in and sales to the united states government  mainly the department of agriculture  amounted to approximately  and of processed pineapple sales in  and  respectively 
competition we sell our products in competition with both foreign and united states companies 
our principal competitors are dole food company  inc  del monte food co  and del monte fresh produce company  each of which produces substantial quantities of fresh and or processed pineapple products  a significant portion of which is produced in central america and southeast asia 
other major sources of competition in the processed pineapple sector are thailand and indonesia 
foreign production has the advantage of lower land  water  labor  and regulatory costs 
our principal marketing advantages are the premium quality of our fresh and processed pineapple  the relative proximity to the united states west coast fresh fruit market  and being the only processor of pineapple in the united states 
the price of our products is influenced by supply and demand of pineapple products and other fruits and juices 
in november  del monte fresh produce hawaii inc announced the immediate closure of its hawaii fresh pineapple operations 
this immediate removal of a substantial volume of pineapple provides opportunity for us to increase our fresh pineapple market share in hawaii and to leverage the regional branding attributes of hawaiian grown pineapple to mainland united states customers 
resort kapalua land company  ltd 
is the operating subsidiary of our resort segment  which operates the kapalua resort  a master planned  golf resort community on maui s northwest coast 
the kapalua resort is part of approximately  acres of our land holdings in west maui  most of which remain as conservation or open space

we also utilize nationally televised professional golf tournaments as a major marketing tool for the kapalua resort 
since january  kapalua has hosted the mercedes benz championship  the season opening event for the pga tour 
through the non profit organization  kapalua maui charities  inc  we have agreements with mercedes benz and the pga tour to host and manage this event at the kapalua resort through january other signature events of the kapalua resort include whalequest at kapalua  an annual event that commenced in february to celebrate the annual migration of north pacific humpback whales to hawaiian waters  and includes lectures  tours and educational workshops  celebration of the arts  an annual event held in april that pays tribute to the people  arts and culture of hawaii through demonstrations in hula and chant  workshops in hawaiian art  and one on one interaction with local artists  kapalua wine food festival  an annual event held in july that attracts world famous winemakers  chefs and visitors to kapalua for a series of wine tasting  festive gatherings and gourmet meals 
the kapalua resort faces substantial competition from alternative visitor destinations and resort communities in hawaii and throughout the world 
the kapalua resort s primary resort competitors on maui are located in kaanapali  which is approximately five miles from kapalua  and wailea on maui s south coast 
community development the community development segment is responsible for all of our real estate entitlement  development  construction  sales and leasing activities 
our projects are focused primarily on the luxury real estate market within the central area of kapalua resort and affordable and moderately priced residential and mixed use projects in west maui and upcountry maui 
this segment also includes the operations of kapalua realty company  a general brokerage real estate company located within the kapalua resort  and our public utilities commission regulated water and sewage transmission operations that service the kapalua resort 
we are the ground lessor under a long term lease for the ritz carlton  kapalua hotel 
we also receive rental income from certain other commercial and residential properties 
in august  we contributed the fee interests in the land underlying the kapalua bay hotel and our interests in the kapalua shops to kapalua bay llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of kapalua bay holdings  llc bay holdings a limited liability company formed as a joint venture between the company  marriott international inc and exclusive resorts llc 
we have a interest in and are the managing member of bay holdings 
in april  the kapalua bay hotel was closed and demolition of the property began in july in connection with the construction of the residences at kapalua bay project 
see other assets kapalua bay holdings  llc  note to the consolidated financial statements 
appropriate entitlements must be obtained for land that is intended for development 
securing proper land entitlement is a process that requires obtaining county  state and federal approvals  which can take many years to complete and entails a variety of risks 
the entitlement process requires that we satisfy all conditions and restrictions imposed in connection with such governmental approvals  including among other things  construction of infrastructure improvements  payment of impact fees for things such as parks and traffic mitigation  restrictions on permitted uses of the land  and provision of affordable housing 
we actively work with the community  regulatory agencies  and legislative bodies at all levels of government in an effort to obtain necessary entitlements consistent with the needs of the community 
we have approximately  acres of land in maui that are at various stages in the land entitlement process as follows number zoned for location of acres planned use kapalua resort yes other kapalua resort and west maui no upcountry no honolua ridge phase i and ii are comprised of a total agricultural lots ranging from three to acres  with list sales prices ranging from  to million 
we began selling phase i in and phase ii in as of december   all phase i lots had been sold and there were nine unsold lots remaining in honolua ridge phase ii 
in  we sold  acres of non core properties in three transactions that resulted in net cash sales proceeds of million 
see real estate sales  note to the consolidated financial statements 
some of the projects that the community development segment has in the planning stages include kapalua mauka as presently planned  this project is comprised of single and multi family residential units and commercial components  five acres of commercial space and up to holes of golf 
the village at kapalua this is the commercial component of the central area of the kapalua resort 
it is planned to be built in two phases and will add approximately  square feet of new retail space to the kapalua resort 
the village will also include apartments  condominiums and other resort related facilities 
the grand opening of the first phase was held in october pulelehua this project is designed to be a new traditional community for working families in west maui 
it encompasses acres and is currently planned to include acres for an elementary school  dwelling units  acres of usable open space  and a traditional village center with a mix of residential and neighborhood serving commercial uses 
we are currently in the process of securing a date for hearing of the project by the maui county council land use committee 
the residences at kapalua bay this project includes the construction of approximately units that will be sold as whole ownership and fractional ownership residences  a clubhouse  pool  spa and other amenities on the site of the former kapalua bay hotel 
demolition of the hotel and construction began in july of together with our joint venture partners we began the recycling and upcycling of all salvable materials with the intent of reusing over of the material from the existing hotel after closure of the hotel in early april 
in june  we began to finalize binding sales contracts for the whole ownership units and in july we began sales of the fractional ownership units 
construction loan financing for this project was concluded in july 
hali imaile town this new town in upcountry maui will be a holistic traditional community where agriculture  education  and sustainability are core design elements 
a series of community design workshops were held in march to involve the maui community in determining the vision for this expansion of the community 
the public approval process for any plan to develop this area is expected to take several years and will be subject to urban growth boundary determination by the county of maui when it updates the county general plan over the next three years 
the price and market for luxury real estate on maui has in the past been highly cyclical based upon interest rates  the popularity of hawaii as a vacation destination  the general condition of the economy in the united states and asia  and the relationship of the dollar to foreign currencies 
the community development segment faces substantial competition from other land developers on the island of maui as well as in other parts of hawaii and the mainland united states 
employees in  we employed approximately  people 
agricultural operations employed approximately full time and approximately seasonal or intermittent employees 
approximately of the agricultural operations employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
resort operations employed approximately employees  of which approximately were part time employees and approximately were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
the community development segment employed approximately employees  and corporate and support services employed approximately employees in other information our agriculture segment engages in continuous research to develop techniques to reduce costs through crop production and processing innovations and to develop and perfect new products 
research and development expenses approximated  in   in and  in we have reviewed our compliance with federal  state and local provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise related to the protection of the environment 
we do not expect any material future financial impact as a result of compliance with these laws 
pursuant to a settlement agreement with the county of maui in  we have a commitment until december  to share with several chemical manufacturers in the capital costs to install filtration systems in any future water wells if the presence of a nematocide  commonly known as dbcp  exceeds specified levels  and for the ongoing maintenance and operating costs for filtrations systems on existing and future wells 
we are not presently aware of any plans by the county of maui to install other filtration systems or to drill any water wells in areas affected by agricultural chemicals

risk factors our success depends in large part upon the continued services of a number of significant employees  the loss of which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operation 
we are currently dependent upon the ability and experience of certain key management employees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain their services 
we do not currently carry key man insurance on any of these individuals  and loss of one or more could have a material adverse effect on financial results 
real estate investments are subject to numerous risks 
we are subject to the risks that generally relate to investments in real property because we develop and sell real property  primarily for residential use 
also  we have a ownership interest in kapalua bay holdings  llc  the owner and developer of the residences at kapalua bay when interest rates increase  the cost of acquiring  developing  expanding or renovating real property increases and real property values may decrease as the number of potential buyers decrease 
similarly  as financing becomes less available  it becomes more difficult both to acquire and to sell real property 
under eminent domain laws  governments can take real property 
sometimes this taking is for less compensation than the owner believes the property is worth 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
in addition  equity real estate investments may be difficult to sell quickly and we may not be able to adjust our portfolio of properties quickly in response to economic or other conditions 
if we are unable to complete land development projects within forecasted timing and budgeting  or at all  financial results may be negatively affected 
we intend to develop resort and other properties  as suitable opportunities arise  taking into consideration the general economic climate 
new project developments have a number of risks  including risks associated with construction delays or cost overruns that may increase project costs  receipt of zoning  occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations  development costs incurred for projects that are not pursued to completion  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  fires or other natural disasters that could adversely impact a project  defects in design or construction that may result in additional costs to remedy or require all or a portion of a property to be closed during the period required to rectify the situation  ability to raise capital  governmental restrictions on the nature or size of a project or timing of completion  and potential lack of adequate building construction capacity for large development projects 
if any development project is not completed on time or within budget  this could have a materially adverse affect on our financial results 
if we are unable to obtain required land use entitlements at reasonable costs  or at all  our operating results would be adversely affected 
our financial results are highly dependant on our community development operating segment 
the financial performance of our community development segment is closely related to our success in obtaining land use entitlements for proposed development projects 
obtaining all of the necessary entitlements to develop a parcel of land is often difficult  costly and may take several years  or more  to complete 
in some situations  we may be unable to obtain the necessary entitlements to proceed with a real estate development or may be required to alter our plans for the development 
delays or failures to obtain these entitlements may have a materially adverse affect on our financial results 
recent legislation adopted by the county of maui may increase land use entitlement costs  negatively impact land values  defer planned development projects  and materially impact operating results 
on november   the maui county council voted unanimously to adopt a residential workforce housing policy the policy 
this measure requires developers to sell or rent to of the total number of units in developments of five or more units at below market rates  or pay significant fees or contribute property with equivalent value to maui county for low income housing 
prior to the adoption of the policy  the affordable housing component of a development typically represented to of total units 
we believe that the new policy could significantly impact our cost of obtaining entitlements  increase our financing costs  potentially reduce the value of our land  and delay the development of units across all market segments 
the policy also sets forth certain requirements for offering affordable units  including a lottery format for selecting potential residents 
we believe that this feature will open affordable projects to any party based solely on economic qualifications and chance 
ironically  the lottery requirement may serve as an additional disincentive to build affordable housing projects for local employees  teachers  public safety personnel  health care professionals and other workers that provide critical services for our community 
these factors will result in a re assessment of planned projects with significant affordable housing components designated for local residents  such as our previously announced pulelehua project 
the historical price and market for luxury real estate on maui has been highly cyclical and if the market demand for luxury real estate were to decrease  our operating results could be adversely affected 
the highs and lows in the real estate market cycle can prevail for multiple years at a time 
during low periods of demand  real estate product may remain in inventory for much longer than expected or be sold at lower than expected returns  or even at a loss  which could impair our liquidity and ability to proceed with additional land development projects and negatively affect our operating results 
if we are unable to successfully compete with other developers of luxury real estate on maui  our financial results could be materially affected 
our real estate product faces competition from other luxury resort real estate properties on maui  and from other luxury resort residential property in hawaii and the mainland united states 
in many cases  our competitors are larger than us and have greater access to capital 
if we are unable to compete with these larger competitors  our financial results could be materially and adversely affected 
we have entered into limited guarantees under which we may be required to guarantee completion of the kapalua bay project or certain limited recourse obligations of kapalua bay  llc 
kapalua bay  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of kapalua bay holdings  llc  in which we own a ownership interest  entered into a construction loan agreement with lehman brothers holdings inc lehman on july   pursuant to which lehman may loan kapalua bay up to million 
kapalua bay intends to construct a new project consisting of residential development on land that it owns at the site of the former kapalua bay hotel  and a spa on an adjacent parcel of land that is owned by us and leased to kapalua bay 
in connection with entering into the construction loan agreement by kapalua bay  we  and other members of kapalua bay holdings entered into a completion guaranty and a recourse guaranty 
under the completion guaranty  members of kapalua bay holdings agreed to guarantee substantial completion of the project and to reimburse lehman for expenses incurred by lehman toward completion of the project 
under the recourse guaranty  members of kapalua bay holdings agreed to reimburse lehman for losses incurred by lehman due to specified actions of kapalua bay holdings  including  without limitation  fraud or intentional misrepresentation  gross negligence  physical waste of project assets  and breach of certain environmental provisions of the construction loan agreement 
our guarantees do not include payment in full of the loan 
if kapalua bay fails to complete the project or takes any of the specified actions that result in expenses to lehman and which are covered by the guarantees that we entered into  we could incur unanticipated expenses that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if ancient human remains continue to be uncovered at the construction site of the residences at kapalua bay project  our expected financial returns from the project could be negatively impacted 
in mid december  in the process of excavation work at the residences at kapalua bay project  two sets of ancient human remains were found 
construction was halted at the two locations where the remains were found and we have been working with the state historic preservation division and the maui lanai island burial council to determine the best plan of action for the remains 
at a minimum  we will need to remove and re intern the remains 
the discovery of additional remains  a concentration of remains in an area or pervasive findings of remains could result in the need to redesign portions of the project 
the discovery of ancient remains at job sites in hawaii are relatively common  but can result in substantial additional cost and fewer units available for sale 
if we cannot attract and retain skilled workers for our resort operations  our financial results could be negatively impacted 
there is a potential lack of adequate skilled workers on maui for larger development projects 
our golf courses require a large number of course and facility maintenance and operations workers and the hotel and villas require housekeepers  food and beverage servers  front desk  and other operational and hospitality workers 
overall  our resort operations require a large number of workers to maintain the quality and level of service that we strive to provide to our guests 
our plans for development projects require that there be adequate labor in all of the construction trades 
the labor market on maui is very competitive  with the labor premium in west maui being even greater than elsewhere on maui 
the cost and insufficient supply of housing and the absence of adequate public services  such as schools  continue to be an impediment to attracting and retaining labor 
if we and other maui businesses are unable to gain approvals from the government to allow for the expansion of affordable housing and to implement plans to provide a higher level of public services  including schools  further development in west maui could be severely restricted  which in turn could have a materially adverse effect on our operations 
while we proposes to pay our fair share for the provision of affordable housing and the construction of infrastructure  there are political factions in the county government who do not want any further development 
we may be subject to certain environmental regulations under which we may have additional liability and experience additional costs for land development 
various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations regulate our properties and could make us liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up hazardous or toxic substances on  under  or in property we currently owns or operates or that we previously owned or operated 
these laws could impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to properly clean up such substances when present  could jeopardize our ability to develop  use  sell or rent the real property or to borrow using the real property as collateral 
if we arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic wastes  we could be liable for the costs of removing or cleaning up wastes at the disposal or treatment facility  even if we never owned or operated that facility 
certain laws  ordinances and regulations  particularly those governing the management or preservation of wetlands  coastal zones and threatened or endangered species  could limit our ability to develop  use  sell or rent its real property 
our agriculture operations face significant competition from companies with greater financial resources and from foreign competition with lower cost structures 
we sell our products in competition with both foreign and united states companies 
our principal competitors are three companies  dole food company  inc  del monte food co  and del monte fresh produce company  each of which produce substantial quantities of pineapple products  a significant portion of which is produced in central america and southeast asia 
other producers of pineapple products in thailand and indonesia also are a major source of competition 
producers of pineapple in foreign countries have substantially lower land  water  labor  and regulatory costs than we do 
our marketing strategy is to compete based on the premium quality of our fresh pineapple product and being the only company that cans all of its pineapple in the united states 
if we cannot compete effectively with these larger companies and lower cost producers  our financial results could be adversely affected 
changes in weather conditions or natural disasters can have an adverse impact on crop production and materially affect our results of operations 
changes in weather conditions and natural disasters  such as earthquakes  droughts  extreme cold or pestilence  may affect the planting  growing and delivery of crops  reduce sales stock  interrupt distribution  and have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our competitors may be affected differently by such weather conditions and natural disasters depending on the location of their supplies or operations 
we have diversified growing regions in central and west maui to mitigate some of these weather related risks 
if we are unable to successfully compete with other producers of fresh and processed pineapple  our financial results could be materially affected 
the fresh and processed pineapple markets are highly competitive 
a decline in the price of pineapple or increases in the price of fuel or packaging materials could adversely affect operating results 
agricultural chemicals used in the past have resulted in contingent liabilities that could result in future claims against us 
one customer has provided a substantial portion of our processed pineapple sales  the loss of this customer may have a material adverse effect on operating results 
the united states government represented approximately  and of our processed pineapple sales for  and  respectively 
it is difficult to predict whether the united states government will continue to represent such a significant portion of our processed pineapple sales in the future because we do not have a long term contract to supply pineapple to the government 
if we were to lose the united states government as a customer  our operating results would be negatively affected 
our ability to competitively serve our customers depends on the availability of reliable and low cost transportation  and any increases in transportation related costs could have material adverse impact on our results of operations 
we use multiple forms of transportation to bring our products to market  including by airplanes  ships  railcars and trucks 
disruption to the timely supply of these services or increases in the cost of these services for any reason  including availability or cost of fuel  regulations affecting the industry  or labor shortages in the transportation industry  could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers  and could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance 
we rely upon co packers to provide our supply of some products  and any failure by co packers to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect our financial performance 
we sell pineapple juice and pineapple juice in plastic bottles of various sizes to large grocery chains in the continental united states 
the pineapple juice ingredients are shipped in bulk from our cannery on maui to co packers on the mainland that bottle the juice to our specifications under certain co pack agreements 
the failure for any reason of any such co packer to fulfill its obligations under the applicable agreements with us could result in disruptions to our supply of finished goods and have an adverse effect on our financial performance 
we cannot provide assurance that a new arrangement would be available on terms as favorable to us as the existing co pack arrangement  if at all 
because we are located in hawaii and therefore apart from the mainland united states  we are more sensitive to certain economic factors  which may adversely affect operating results 
our community development segment and the resort segment are dependent on attracting visitors to kapalua  to maui  and the state of hawaii as a whole 
economic factors that affect the number of visitors  their length of stay or expenditure levels will affect our financial performance 
factors such as the cost of energy  events in the airline industry that affect passenger capacity or traveling cost  and the threat  or perceived threat  of heightened terrorist activity in the united states  could affect a potential visitor s choice of vacation destination or second home location

income for and also includes approximately million and million pre tax  respectively  of asset write offs  accelerated depreciation  severance and other charges related to restructuring our operations and processes 
results for also include our equity in the losses of kapalua bay holdings  llc of million  which primarily represents sales and marketing costs 
the reduction in revenues in was due to a million decrease from the agriculture segment  million from the community development segment  partially offset by a million increase from the resort segment 
general and administrative in  general and administrative expenses increased by to million compared to million for the major components of the difference in general and administrative expenses were as follows years ended december  difference in millions salaries and wages employee severance expense professional and other outside services depreciation and asset write offs medical insurance premiums employee incentives and stock compensation other net total approximately million of the increase in salaries and wages in was due to salaries and wages for our agriculture segment personnel who were taken out of operations to be trained for other work 
these employees were removed from the pineapple operations in connection with the transition to a less labor intensive operation that is more focused on fresh fruit 
the remaining increase in salaries and wages were the result of increases in personnel and wage adjustments 
the increase in employee severance cost reflects the reduction in the agriculture segment work force in september and october of  the planned closure of the village course as of february  and management changes in see subsequent events note to consolidated financial statements 
the decrease in professional and other outside services primarily reflects costs incurred in to maintain and adjust the accounting system that was being used by our agriculture segment 
a decision was made in the fourth quarter of to replace accounting information technology systems and standardize our primary accounting systems and processes used by all of our businesses 
in addition  the decrease in professional and other outside services costs in is due to higher cost incurred in to prepare the company for compliance with section  sarbanes oxley act of in  after planning the construction of a fresh fruit packing facility adjacent to our kahului cannery  we changed the estimated useful life of the affected assets and began the acceleration of depreciation of those assets 
plans regarding the construction of a new cannery and can plant were revised in january  and accordingly  we prospectively revised depreciation charges on the cannery and plant 
in  we began the execution of our plans to replace all of our accounting systems and we began the acceleration of depreciation for those assets 
these accounting system assets were fully depreciated in the first half  as the new accounting system was placed in service as of the beginning of the third quarter of in and  we recorded charges of million and million  respectively  for the write off of inventory  machinery  equipment  and deferred costs primarily because of changes in our businesses 
the reduction in medical insurance premium expense in primarily reflects the reduction in the agriculture segment work force 
general and administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the operating segment level 
all general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level are allocated to the operating segments 
such allocations are consistent with our management s evaluation of the services provided to the operating segments 
interest expense interest expense was  for compared to  for interest incurred in was  of which  was capitalized to construction projects 
our major capital projects under construction in included honolua ridge phase ii  honolua village at kapalua resort  the fresh fruit packing facility and offices  and replacement of our accounting systems 
in  interest incurred was  of which  was capitalized 
our effective interest rate on borrowings was in compared to in agriculture years ended december  difference in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the agriculture segment reported an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for revenues for were million or lower than primarily due to a lower case volume of processed pineapple sales that were only partially offset by higher case volume of fresh pineapple sales 
operating losses reported by the agriculture segment for and include million and million  respectively  for asset write offs and accelerated depreciation charges related to assets where the estimated useful lives were reduced because of changes in our pineapple operations 
the agriculture segment also recorded million for employee severance cost in primarily as a result of production efficiencies gained by the operation of the new fresh fruit packing plant and charges of  related to materials and supplies inventories that were considered obsolete with the change to the new packing facility that went into operation at the end of june in addition  the agriculture segment recorded million of charges related to re training employees in compared to million of re training charges in processed and fresh operations the case volume of fresh pineapple sales increased by and the average revenue per case of fresh pineapple sold increased by less than in compared to revenues from fresh pineapple sales were approximately of the agriculture segment net sales for  compared to approximately for the case volume of processed pineapple sales decreased by in as compared to primarily reflecting our strategy to reduce supply to selected retail market segments 
this market refinement has resulted in the average sales prices for our processed pineapple products increasing by approximately for compared to we implemented price increases for our processed product lines in january  march  and august of  and in may and august of processed pineapple sold to the us government primarily to the department of agriculture comprised approximately of our case volume of canned pineapple sales in compared to in the decrease in the percentage of processed pineapple sales to the us government is a result of unanticipated sales in that did not recur in the agriculture segment cost of sales was lower by in compared to  primarily reflecting the reduced sales volume of processed pineapple partially offset by the increased sales volume of fresh pineapple 
the average per unit cost of sales for processed pineapple was higher in compared to because of the reduced tonnage of fruit being processed  while the average per unit cost of sales for fresh pineapple was lower primarily reflecting efficiencies that the operation is beginning to realize with the operation of the new fresh packing facility 
in and  there were partial liquidations of lifo last in  first out inventories for our processed pineapple products  resulting in lower costs from prior years being charged to cost of sales 
based on current costs  the operating loss for the agriculture segment for and would have increased by approximately million and million  respectively 
agriculture segment shipping and marketing cost decreased by about in compared to principally reflecting a lower volume of processed pineapple  partially offset by higher average cost for shipping and higher volume of fresh fruit shipments 
the average shipping and selling cost for our fresh pineapple was lower in compared to primarily because in we shipped approximately of our fresh product to the mainland united states by ocean transportation as compared to air freight  which is more costly compared to in changes in our cultivation practices  harvesting methods  and post harvest handling have extended the shelf life of fresh fruit products enabling us to increase our reliance on surface transport to reach north american markets 
resort years ended december  difference in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the resort segment reported an operating loss of million for compared to million for resort segment revenues were million for compared to million for  an increase of  as a result of higher revenues from the kapalua villas and from our golf operations primarily due to rate increases 
the operating loss for includes  of employee severance expense  primarily reflecting the planned february  closure of the village course and management changes 
the operating loss for also includes higher expenses in particular for advertising and promotions  utilities and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the plantation course was closed from april through july of for renovation of the greens and bunkers 
the closure of that golf course for four months in negatively impacted the operating results from resort operations in compared to hotel and condominium room occupancies at the kapalua resort  and to a somewhat lesser extent for maui in general  largely drive resort activity as reflected by increased golf play and merchandise sales 
in early april  the kapalua bay hotel held its final guest night and the hotel was permanently closed 
this closure resulted in approximately fewer available rooms at kapalua resort and as expected  negatively affected the number of paid rounds of golf and retail sales in golf  retail and villas revenues from golf operations increased by for compared to overall  paid rounds of golf decreased by  and average green and cart fees increased by in compared to resort retail sales for were about lower than sales in lower retail sales reflect the closure of the kapalua bay hotel and the closure of our logo shop  kids shop and home store in may  and our kapalua collection store in march these shops were adjacent to the hotel and represented approximately  square feet of retail area 
in mid october  our new  square foot kapalua collections store featuring upscale resort wear opened at the honolua village center in our central resort area 
revenues from the kapalua villas increased in compared to  primarily reflecting an increase in the average room rates  partially offset by a lower number of occupied rooms 
the increase in average room rates were due to a greater number of direct bookings and a more aggressive pricing strategy across all channels and product categories 
community development years ended december  difference in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating profit the community development segment reported an operating profit of million for compared to million for revenues from this operating segment were million for compared to million for in  we recognized revenues of million and a pre tax gain of million from the sale of approximately  acres of non core upcountry maui land 
the land sold was comprised of agricultural lands that had been earmarked for disposition as non core to our strategic plans 
in  we recognized revenues of million and operating profit of million from seven real estate sales transactions 
in june  we concluded the sale of approximately acres of land and improvements to the hui no eau visual arts center 
we also sold approximately acres of upcountry maui land in our equity in the losses of kapalua bay holdings  llc was million in compared to  in the increased loss is the result of closure of the kapalua bay hotel in april and the preparation for and commencement of sales and marketing efforts for the whole and fractional condominium units that will comprise the residences at kapalua bay project 
real estate sales honolua ridge phase ii residential subdivision consists of agricultural lots  which began selling in august through the end of  lots had closed escrow  with nine lot sales closing in revenues and profit from this project are being recognized on the percentage of completion method  under which we recognized revenues of million in honolua ridge phase ii was substantially complete as of december  in  we recognized revenues of million from honolua ridge phase i and phase ii lot sales 
at december   the infrastructure improvements for honolua ridge phase i were substantially complete  and honolua ridge phase ii was approximately complete 
our balance sheet at december  included deferred revenues for honolua ridge lots sales recognized on the percentage of completion method of million 
real estate development and sales are cyclical and depend on a number of factors 
results for one period are therefore not necessarily indicative of future performance trends for this segment 
comparison of years ended december  and consolidated years ended december  difference in millions  except per share amounts consolidated revenues net income loss earnings per common share we reported net income of million per share for compared to a net loss of  
per share for consolidated revenues were million for  an increase of from million for the improved results in were primarily attributable to revenues and operating profit from the community development segment as a result of sales of real estate inventories and the sale of other real estate  as further described below

the increase in employee incentives and stock compensation expense was principally the result of accruals for performance based incentives  reflecting our increased emphasis on performance based pay plans 
the decrease in medical insurance premiums in largely reflects the reduction in the work force in the agriculture segment that occurred in and in employee severance expense was lower in because of management changes at the corporate level in in addition  employee severance charges arising from reduction in the work force in the agriculture segment were approximately million in compared to  in the increase in depreciation and asset write offs charged to general and administrative expenses primarily relate to acceleration of depreciation charges on certain assets from the current cannery  can plant and fresh fruit processing facility  acceleration of depreciation charges on our integrated accounting system  write off of assets related to our payroll and human resource accounting system  and the write off of other assets that we have ceased to use 
in  we began planning the construction of a processing facility to replace our fresh fruit packing plant  and a multi commodity multi client processing facility to replace our cannery and can plant 
in  we began to evaluate the agriculture segment assets and record depreciation charges related to the change in estimated useful life of these assets 
we estimated that agriculture segment assets with a net book value of approximately million will be expensed over the month period ending december  this resulted in additional depreciation charges of million in in  as we evaluated our businesses  operations and processes it became evident that the accounting systems currently in use were not able to meet our expanding needs 
our payroll and human resource accounting functions were outsourced to a third party provider at the end of and the net book value of the related in house systems was written off 
in the fourth quarter of  we concluded plans to replace the other primary accounting systems that were being used and began to accelerate the depreciation of the existing accounting systems 
evaluation of our fixed assets in also resulted in the identification of assets that we will no longer use because of changes in plans and operations 
in  we expensed million for these asset write offs and acceleration of depreciation for accounting systems 
the increase in professional and other outside services in reflects the cost of outside consultants primarily to assist us in documenting our internal controls and processes required  in part  by the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act 
the increase in professional and other outside services also reflects charges incurred in for modifications and adjustments to our accounting system and additional training of our employees on use of the system 
reduction in staffing and staff turnover  particularly in the agriculture segment  necessitated re training of the staff 
general and administrative expenses are incurred at the corporate level and at the operating segment level 
all general and administrative expenses incurred at the corporate level are allocated to the operating segments 
such allocations are consistent with management s evaluation of the operating segments 
interest expense interest expense of  for was lower by compared to the decrease in interest expense was due to lower average borrowings and to a higher amount of capitalized interest in capitalized interest was  for compared to  for  primarily as a result of construction activities at the kapalua resort 
the company s average interest rate on borrowings was in compared to in  due to higher borrowing rates from financial institutions 
agriculture years ended december  difference in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the agriculture segment reported an operating loss from continuing operations of million for compared to an operating loss of million for revenues in of million were lower than revenues in lower agriculture segment revenues in was due to a reduced sales volume of processed pineapple  which was partially offset by increased fresh pineapple sales volume and higher average prices for both processed and fresh pineapple in non recurring items the operating loss for includes million for asset write offs and additional depreciation charges for assets where the estimated useful lives were reduced because of changes in the operations of the agriculture segment  as mentioned in general and administrative above 
the operating loss for included million of asset write offs related to the restructuring of the agriculture segment operations 
revenues for include million received from the us customs service compared to million received from this program in these cash distributions were made pursuant to the continued dumping and subsidy offset act of  or the cdsoa  which allows for distribution of antidumping duties to injured domestic producers 
the distributions are recorded as other income in the consolidated statements of operations 
anti dumping duties have been in effect on processed pineapple fruit imported from thailand since in late  the anti dumping duty order on several thailand exporters of processed pineapple  which together accounted for more than of the thailand exports to the united states  was revoked 
as a result  these thailand exporters no longer have anti dumping duties assessed on their exports to the united states 
these revocations have had  and will continue to have  an effect on the amount of funds collected and distributed to us under the cdsoa

agriculture shipping and marketing cost decreased by million  or  in as compared to  largely reflecting the lower sales volume of processed pineapple  partially offset by increased ocean and airfreight shipping costs per unit 
increased use of surface shipment  instead of the higher cost air shipment  was also responsible for the lower cost in in  we shipped approximately of our maui gold fresh pineapple by surface  rather than by air  compared to about in reductions in the work force at our sales and marketing office and an increase in shipments directly to our customers as opposed to interim storage of inventory in public warehouses  also contributed to lower shipping and marketing costs in resort years ended december  difference in millions revenues of consolidated revenues operating loss the resort segment reported an operating loss of million for compared to an operating loss of million for resort revenues of million in were higher than in hotel and condominium room occupancies at the kapalua resort  and to a somewhat lesser extent for maui in general  largely drive the increase in resort activity as reflected by increased golf play  merchandise sales and lease revenues
