executive overview our business consists of three segments poloexpress  hein gericke  and aerospace 
our poloexpress and hein gericke segments are engaged in the design and retail sale of protective clothing  helmets  and technical accessories for motorcyclists in europe and our hein gericke segment is engaged in the design and distribution of such apparel in the united states 
our aerospace segment stocks a wide variety of aircraft parts  then distributes them to commercial airlines and air cargo carriers  fixed base operators  corporate aircraft operators  and other aerospace companies worldwide 
for the year ended september   we reported a loss from continuing operations of million  as compared to a loss of million in fiscal the current year s loss from continuing operations benefited from the settlement of the shareholder derivative litigation  which improved results by approximately million 
excluding this item  the increased loss from continuing operations resulted primarily from lower revenues in our hein gericke segment 
the inventory demands of our poloexpress and hein gericke businesses and our consolidated operating losses have contributed primarily to our million use of cash in our operating activities in fiscal as of september   we have unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments of million  and available borrowing under lines of credit of million 
as of june   we have unrestricted cash  cash equivalents and investments of million  and available borrowing under lines of credit of million 
we have undertaken a number of actions  which we believe will improve the results of hein gericke in and beyond including consolidating and centralizing our warehouse facilities to one location to service all of europe 
improving timeliness of product deliveries from suppliers to our warehouse and delivery to the stores 
reintroducing our hein gericke product catalog to expand brand awareness and attract customer traffic 
optimizing store location and appearance 
in addition  we plan to continue cost structure improvements by taking aggressive actions to reduce expenses 
identify and target strategic markets outside of germany and the united kingdom for possible expansion 
close stores which do not provide a positive contribution 
we also have taken action to reduce the cash needs of fairchild sports usa by significantly downsizing the operations and focusing efforts primarily on its design and licensing businesses 
on july   republic thunderbolt  llc an indirect  wholly owned subsidiary of the company completed the sale of airport plaza  a shopping center located in farmingdale  new york  to an affiliate of kimco realty corporation 
the sale does not include several other undeveloped parcels of real estate that we own in farmingdale  new york  the largest of which is under contract of sale to the market chain  stew leonards 
we decided to sell the shopping center to enhance our financial flexibility  allowing us to pursue other opportunities 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale 
as a condition to closing  the buyer assumed our existing mortgage loan on airport plaza that had an outstanding principal balance of approximately million on the closing date 
also as a condition to closing  we provided the buyer with an environmental indemnification and agreed to remediate an environmental matter that was identified  the costs of which are estimated to be between million and million 
we expect to recognize a gain of approximately million from this transaction 
however  because of the uncertain nature of the environmental liabilities that we retained  the gain recognition is required to be delayed until the remediation efforts are complete 
on may   we decided to borrow million from goldentree capital opportunities  lp and goldentree capital solutions fund financing to further improve our liquidity and provide us with flexible opportunities to invest in our existing operations  pursue acquisition opportunities  provide a source for any additional cash needs of our hein gericke operations during the season  or consider the repurchase of our outstanding stock 
subsequent to september   and directly resulting from the financial statement restatement process  we were unable to provide to the lenders timely financial statements for the year ended september   and the quarters ended december   march   and june   as required by the credit agreement 
our lenders have waived certain provisions in the credit agreement and granted us an extension in time to provide these financial statements 
our cash needs are generally the highest during our second and third quarters of our fiscal year  when our hein gericke and poloexpress segments purchase inventory in advance of the spring and summer selling seasons 
accordingly  million was available and utilized to finance the fiscal seasonal trough to support our poloexpress operations  and million will be available to finance the fiscal season 
we expect that cash on hand  which includes cash proceeds received from the sale of our shopping center  the alcoa earn out and escrow  the proceeds available from additional seasonal borrowings  cash available from lines of credit  and proceeds received from dispositions of short term investments and other non core assets  will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements through december in the event our cash needs are substantially higher than projected  particularly during the fiscal seasonal trough  we will take additional actions to generate the required cash 
these actions may include one or any combination of the following liquidating investments and other non core assets 
refinancing existing debt and borrowing additional funds which may be available to us from improved performances at our aerospace and poloexpress operations or increased values of certain real estate we own 
eliminating  reducing  or delaying all non essential services provided by outside parties  including consultants 
significantly reducing our corporate overhead expenses 
delaying inventory purchases 
however  if we need to implement one or more of these actions  there remains some uncertainty that we will actually receive a sufficient amount of cash in time to meet all of our needs during the fiscal seasonal trough 
even if sufficient cash is realized  any or all of these actions may have adverse effects on our operating results or business 
we may also consider raising cash to meet the subsequent needs of our operations by issuing additional stock or debt  entering into partnership arrangements  liquidating assets  or other means 
should these actions be insufficient  we may be forced to liquidate other non essential assets and significantly reduce overhead expenses 
critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include the valuation of long lived assets  impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  pension and postretirement benefits  deferred and noncurrent income taxes  environmental and litigation accruals  and revenue recognition 
estimates in each of these areas are based on historical experience and a variety of assumptions that we believe are appropriate 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
valuation of long lived assets we review our long lived assets for impairment  including property  plant and equipment  and identifiable intangibles with definite lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable 
to determine recoverability of our long lived assets  we evaluate the probability that future undiscounted net cash flows will be greater than the carrying amount of our assets 
impairment is measured based on the difference between the carrying amount of our assets and their estimated fair value 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized 
instead of amortizing goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  these assets are tested for impairment annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that such an impairment could exist 
pension and postretirement benefits we have defined benefit pension plans covering certain of our current and former employees 
our funding policy is to make the minimum annual contribution required by the employee retirement income security act of or local statutory law 
the accumulated benefit obligation for pensions and postretirement benefits was determined using a discount rate of and at september  and  respectively  and an estimated return on plan assets of at september  and assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for health care plans 
for measurement purposes  in  we assumed a annual rate of increase in the cost per capita of claims covered under health care benefits 
in  the trend rate is assumed to decrease each year by to a rate of in and remain at that level thereafter 
the effect of any change in these assumptions may result in a material change to the accumulated benefit obligation 
deferred and noncurrent income taxes deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  the limitations that some taxing jurisdictions in which we operate have on our ability to use tax loss carry forwards to offset certain recorded deferred tax liabilities and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
the liability for noncurrent income taxes includes significant judgments and interpretations of tax laws 
therefore  the ultimate resolution of the associated contingencies could vary materially from the amounts accrued 
environmental matters our current and prior operations are subject to stringent government imposed environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  the discharge of materials into the environment and the generation  handling  storage  transportation  and disposal of waste and hazardous materials 
to date  such laws and regulations have had a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  or net cash flows  and we have expended  and can be expected to expend in the future  significant amounts for the investigation of environmental conditions and installation of environmental control facilities  remediation of environmental conditions and other similar matters 
in connection with our plans to dispose of certain real estate  we must investigate environmental conditions and we may be required to take certain corrective action prior or pursuant to any such disposition 
in addition  we have identified several areas of potential contamination related to other facilities owned  or previously owned  by us  which may require us either to take corrective action or to contribute to a clean up 
we are also a defendant in several lawsuits and proceedings seeking to require us to pay for investigation or remediation of environmental matters  and for injuries to persons or property allegedly caused thereby  and we have been alleged to be a potentially responsible party at various superfund sites 
at the end of each calendar quarter  we thoroughly review our environmental matters and adjust our accrual to equal the estimated probable amount that it will cost us in connection with these matters 
we believe that we have recorded adequate accruals in our consolidated financial statements to complete such investigation and take any necessary corrective actions or make any necessary contributions or other payments 
legal matters we are involved in various other claims and lawsuits incidental to our business 
we  either on our own or through our insurance carriers  are contesting these matters 
at the end of each calendar quarter  we thoroughly review our legal matters and adjust our accrual to equal the estimated probable amount that it will cost us in connection with these matters 
in the opinion of management  the ultimate resolution of the legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  future results of operations  or net cash flows 
revenue recognition revenues within our poloexpress and hein gericke segments are recognized immediately upon the sale of merchandise by our retail stores  net of an allowance for returns 
sales and related costs within our aerospace segment are recognized on shipment of products and or performance of services  when collection is probable 
lease and rental revenue are recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease 
shipping and handling amounts billed to customers are classified as revenues

in fiscal  we recognized a million gain on disposal of discontinued operations as a result of this transaction 
on june   we completed the sale of our fairchild aerostructures business for million to pca aerospace 
the cash received from pca aerospace is subject to a post closing adjustment based upon the net working capital of the business on january   compared with its net working capital as of june   which we have estimated to be approximately million  and is included in accounts receivable at september  pca aerospace disputes the working capital post closing adjustment  and also alleges that we owe pca aerospace million 
we have notified pca aerospace of our dispute of these claims 
in connection with the sale  we deposited with an escrow agent approximately million to secure indemnification obligations we may have to pca aerospace  which was returned to us  with interest  upon termination of the month escrow period 
we decided to sell fairchild aerostructures  which was included in our aerospace segment  because we believe we received adequate fair value for a business whose performance was below our expectations  and because its business was unrelated to other businesses we own 
we used million of the proceeds from the sale to repay a portion of our cit revolving credit facility and we used the remaining proceeds from the sale to reinvest in our existing operations

on january   we used available cash to pay mr 
esser million million and provided collateral of million million to a german bank to issue a guarantee to mr 
esser to secure the price for the put mr 
esser has a right to exercise in april the transaction includes an agreement with mr 
esser under which he agrees with us not to compete with poloexpress for two years 
on march   we amended an agreement with mr 
esser  regarding his continued employment  and agreed to continue his employment through december  through september   in addition to his base salary  mr 
esser received a profit distribution of approximately million  which reduces  on a euro for euro basis  the call or put option price we must pay for his interest 
as of september   the million million collateralized obligation for the put option  net of distributions  was included in other long term liabilities 
the million million restricted cash is invested in a capital protected investment and money market funds  and is included in long term investments 
we have treated the put or call option as a debt instrument as it effectively established the price mr 
esser will receive for his portion of the business 
the total purchase price exceeded the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired by approximately million 
approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to identifiable intangible assets  including brand names hein gericke and polo  and reflected in intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements as of september  the remaining purchase price was allocated to goodwill 
since their acquisition on november   we have consolidated the results of hein gericke  poloexpress  and fairchild sports usa into our financial statements

during the four year period from to  we are entitled to receive additional cash proceeds of million for each commercial aircraft delivered by boeing and airbus in excess of stated threshold levels  up to a maximum of million per year 
deliveries exceeded the threshold aircraft delivery level needed for us to earn the full million contingent payment for   and accordingly  we recognized a million gain on disposal of discontinued operations in fiscal   and the remaining threshold aircraft delivery level is in on december   we deposited with an escrow agent million to secure indemnification obligations we may have to alcoa 
the escrow period remains in effect to december   but funds may be held longer if claims are timely asserted and remain unresolved 
in june  we received an arbitration ruling requiring us to pay million from the escrow to alcoa in satisfaction of health and safety claims asserted by alcoa through december we have sought judicial review of that arbitration award 
since december  alcoa has asserted additional claims for indemnification with respect to which we are contesting or seeking additional information 
the escrow is classified in long term investments on our balance sheet 
in addition  for the period through december   we are required to maintain our corporate existence  take no action to cause our own liquidation or dissolution  and take no action to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock

the change in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the lower volume of revenues 
selling  general and administrative expense in fiscal also benefited from million received by us from the settlement of the shareholder derivative litigation  offset partially by million of related legal fees 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expense as a percentage of revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due primarily to us owning our poloexpress and hein gericke segments for months in fiscal  and a stronger euro as compared to the us dollar in fiscal compared to fiscal other income  net  decreased by million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  due primarily to a million gain recognized on the sale of real estate in fiscal other income decreased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to million of proceeds received from a title insurance claim settlement recognized in fiscal and million of foreign currency gains recognized in fiscal  compared to foreign currency losses of million in fiscal restructuring charges of million in included the costs to close all fifteen of the goto helmstudio retail locations in germany 
all of the charges were the direct result of activities that occurred as of june  the restructuring charges included an accrual for the remaining lease costs of the closed stores  the write off of store fittings  and for severance 
these costs were classified as restructuring and were the direct result of a formal plan to close the goto helmstudio locations and terminate its employees 
such costs are nonrecurring in nature 
other than a reduction in our existing cost structure  none of the restructuring costs will result in future increases in earnings or represent an accrual of future costs of our ongoing business

the settlement allowed us to increase cash available for operations by releasing approximately million of cash held in escrow in excess of the liability 
the overall tax expense for fiscal was million 
a million tax expense from continuing operations resulted from million of current federal  state  and foreign taxes and million of foreign deferred taxes 
the foreign deferred taxes arise from a tax benefit from operating losses of million  offset by million in tax expense related to the impact of the conversion of poloexpress from a german partnership to a german corporation 
the conversion of poloexpress will allow poloexpress and hein gericke deutschland to file consolidated trade tax returns thereby enabling the company to reduce its current income tax and trade tax liabilities 
however  as a result of this conversion  the company was required to record a deferred tax liability of million as it will no longer benefit from future tax deductions related to the amortization of acquired intangibles 
offsetting this liability is million of deferred tax assets related to future tax deductions which were previously not expected to be recoverable 
this conversion will allow our two subsidiaries  hein gericke deutschland and poloexpress  to compute their trade tax liabilities on a combined basis and utilize the cumulative combined income and trade tax losses of approximately million and million  respectively  to offset their combined future profits subject to income and trade tax 
no federal taxes were recognized from continuing operations due to the domestic tax losses

the fullerton property is leased to alcoa through october  and is expected to generate revenues and operating income in excess of million per year

at september   the book value of the huntington beach property was million and we believe the current fair market value is in excess of million

the primary use of cash for operating activities in was a million increase in inventories  and a million increase in accounts receivable  offset partially by a million decrease in trading securities  a million increase in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  and our million net income before depreciation and amortization

our principal cash requirements include supporting our current operations  general and administrative expenses  capital expenditures  and the payment of other liabilities including pension and postretirement benefits  environmental investigation and remediation costs  and litigation related costs 
we expect that cash on hand  cash available from lines of credit  and proceeds received from dispositions of short term investments and other non core assets  will be adequate to satisfy our cash requirements through december in order to improve our liquidity  on december   we signed a definitive agreement to sell our shopping center  airport plaza  located in farmingdale  new york  to an affiliate of kimco realty corporation 
on july   we completed the sale of airport plaza 
we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale 
as a condition to closing  the buyer assumed our existing mortgage loan on airport plaza that had an outstanding principal balance of approximately million on the closing date 
the sale does not include several other undeveloped parcels of real estate that we own in farmingdale  new york  the largest of which is under contract of sale to the market chain  stew leonards 
on may   we decided to borrow million from goldentree capital opportunities  lp and goldentree capital solutions fund financing to further improve our liquidity and provide us with flexible opportunities to invest in our existing operations  pursue acquisition opportunities  provide a guarantee for any additional cash needed by our hein gericke segment and corporate needs  or consider the repurchase of our outstanding stock 
our cash needs are generally the highest during our second and third quarters of our fiscal year  when our hein gericke and poloexpress segments purchase inventory in advance of the spring and summer selling seasons 
in november  we obtained a financing commitment from a second bank to participate in our seasonal credit facility 
accordingly  million was available and utilized to finance the fiscal seasonal trough to support our poloexpress operations  and million will be available to finance the fiscal season 
although we believe that our relationship with the principal lenders to our poloexpress and hein gericke segments is strong  a significant portion of our debt facilities are subject to annual renewal 
we expect that the facilities will be renewed annually in the normal course of business 
should the lenders decide not to renew the facilities  we believe that we could secure alternative funding sources on commercially reasonable terms 
the costs of being a small to mid sized public company have increased substantially with the introduction and implementation of controls and procedures mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of audit and corporate governance related fees have significantly increased over the past two years 
our increased costs also include the effects of acquisitions and additional costs related to compliance with various financing agreements 
the costs to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of alone substantially increased our audit and related costs to approximately million in fiscal  as compared to only million in fiscal this increase is significant for a company of our size 
however  on march   our market capitalization was below the million threshold and accordingly  on september   we ceased to be deemed an accelerated filer in accordance with the united states securities and exchange commission regulations and were not required to have an external audit of our internal controls under section of the sarbanes oxley act of in fiscal we did not have an external audit of our internal controls resulting in a reduction in our audit fees in fiscal however  audit expenses associated with the restatement are expected to lead to a substantial increase in audit fees 
we considered additional options for reducing our public costs  including opportunities to take our company private  or going dark 
an offer to take our company private at per share  led by jeffrey steiner  our chairman and chief executive officer  and philip sassower  was terminated 
as of this date  no further discussions are on going 
however  our senior management will continue to pursue opportunities to reduce our public costs and our corporate expenses and consider any other opportunities to restructure our existing debt and pursue additional merger  acquisition  and divestiture opportunities 
in february  we announced our intention to purchase up to  shares of our outstanding class a common stock 
through september   we acquired  shares at an average price of per share  and have not purchased any shares since may  we may purchase additional shares in the future 
under the terms of the golden tree loan  in order to repurchase shares  our minimum liquidity  as defined in the golden tree agreement  must exceed million 
as of september   our minimum liquidity was million 
in the event that our cash needs are substantially higher than projected  particularly during the fiscal seasonal trough  we will take additional actions to generate the required cash 
these actions may include one or any combination of the following liquidating investments and other non core assets 
refinancing existing debt and borrowing additional funds which may be available to us from improved performances at our aerospace and poloexpress operations or increased values of certain real estate we own 
eliminating  reducing  or delaying all non essential services provided by outside parties  including consultants 
significantly reducing overhead expenses at certain operations and our corporate headquarters 
delaying purchases of inventory 
however  if we need to implement one or more of these actions  there nevertheless remains some uncertainty that we will actually receive a sufficient amount of cash in time to meet all of our needs during the fiscal seasonal trough 
even if sufficient cash is realized  any or all of these actions may have adverse affects on our operating results and or businesses 
we may also consider raising cash to meet the subsequent needs of our operations by issuing additional stock or debt  entering into partnership arrangements  liquidating assets  or other means 
should these actions be insufficient  we may be forced to liquidate other non essential assets  and significantly reduce overhead expenses 
off balance sheet items on september   approximately million of bank loans received by retail shop partners in the poloexpress segment were guaranteed by our subsidiaries and are not reflected on our balance sheet because these loans have not been assumed by us 
these guarantees were assumed by us when we acquired the poloexpress business 
we have guaranteed loans to shop partners for the purchase of store fittings in certain locations where we sell our products 
the loans are secured by the store fittings purchased to outfit these retail stores 
contractual obligations at september   we had contractual commitments to repay debt  to make payments under operating and capital lease obligations  to make pension contribution payments  and to purchase the remaining interest in poloexpress 
payments due under these long term obligations are as follows in thousands thereafter total debt estimated interest costs capital lease obligations operating lease commitments pension contributions postretirement benefits acquire remaining interest in poloexpress total contractual cash obligations we have entered into standby letter of credit arrangements with insurance companies and others  issued primarily to guarantee our payments of workers compensation 
at september   we had contingent liabilities of million on commitments related to outstanding letters of credit 
our operations enter into purchase commitments in the normal course of business 
we have million classified as other long term liabilities at september   including million due to purchase the remaining interest in poloexpress in april the remaining million of other long term liabilities includes environmental and other liabilities  which do not have specific payment terms or other similar contractual arrangements 
currently  we are not being audited by the internal revenue service for any years 
however  we are currently being audited in germany for through our noncurrent tax liability was million at september  however  based on tax planning strategies  we do not anticipate having to satisfy the tax liability over the short term 
in march  our tax liability was reduced by approximately million due to the expiration of the related statute of limitations and closure of the related tax period 
at september   we have million of unused alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards that do not expire and million of federal operating loss carryforwards expiring as follows million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  million in  and million in as the periods of assessment for to have expired during  additional tax may be collected from us only for to tax losses of million arising in years prior to may still be reduced for determining the proper amount of net operating loss available to be carried forward to years after the company also has approximately million of foreign income tax and million of foreign trade tax loss carryforwards that have no expiration period 
the company s policy is to include deductions that are subject to contingencies in its disclosed net operating losses 
the gains on the disposal of discontinued operations we reported between to  for federal income tax  may be significantly increased if our tax position is not sustained with respect to the sales of several businesses  and the repayment with property  of debt under a bank credit agreement in which both we and our subsidiaries were liable  is not treated as tax free under section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
if all of these adjustments were made for to  the federal income tax loss carryforwards might be substantially reduced  and we may be required to pay additional us tax and interest of up to million  which has already been provided 
the amount of additional tax and interest to be paid by us depends on the amount of income tax audit adjustments  which are made and sustained for to these adjustments  if any  would be made at a future date  which is presently uncertain  and therefore we cannot predict the timing of cash outflows 
to the extent a favorable final determination of the recorded income tax liabilities occurs  appropriate adjustments will be made to decrease the recorded tax liability in the year such favorable determination occurs 
should any of these liabilities become immediately due  we may be obligated to obtain financing  raise capital  and or liquidate assets to satisfy our obligations 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
provides a fair value option election that allows companies to irrevocably elect fair value as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for certain financial assets and liabilities  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings as they occur 
sfas no 
permits the fair value option election on an instrument by instrument basis at initial recognition of an asset or liability or upon an event that gives rise to a new basis of accounting for that instrument 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  we are currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our future results of operations and financial position 
in september  the fasb published sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement pension plans  which amends sfas no 
 sfas no 
 sfas no 
 and sfas no 
r 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize in its statement of financial position the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan measured as the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the benefit obligation 
employers must also recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the actuarial gains and losses and the prior service costs and credits that arise during the period 
statement is effective for fiscal years ending after december  if sfas no 
was adopted as of september   the company would have recorded a reduction in prepaid assets and other assets of million and million  respectively  a decrease in pension liabilities of million  and a charge to other accumulated comprehensive income loss of million 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which is intended to increase consistency and comparability in fair value measurements by defining fair value  establishing a framework for measuring fair value and expanding disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our future results of operations and financial position 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
we are required to adopt fin effective october  the cumulative effect of initially adopting fin will be recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings in the year of adoption and will be presented separately 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of fin we are currently evaluating the impact this new standard will have on our future results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas no 
simplifies the accounting for certain derivatives embedded in other financial instruments by allowing them to be accounted for as a whole if the holder elects to account for the entire instrument on a fair value basis 
sfas no 
also clarifies and amends certain other provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments acquired  issued or subject to a remeasurement event occurring in fiscal years beginning after september  earlier adoption is permitted  provided the company has not yet issued financial statements  including for interim periods  for that fiscal year 
we are currently assessing the possible impact  if any  of implementing this standard 
in june  the fasb published sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  which requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of every voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable 
the statement replaces accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting changes  and sfas no 
 reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements  although it carries forward some of their provisions 
the fasb believes that the statement s requirements will enhance the consistency of financial information between periods and is the result of the fasb s efforts to improve the comparability of cross border financial reporting by working with the international accounting standards board toward development of a single set of high quality accounting standards 
statement is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we do not anticipate any impact from adopting this new standard 
in march  the fasb issued fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
fin clarifies the term conditional as used in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this interpretation refers to a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity even if the timing and or settlement is conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of an entity 
accordingly  the entity must record a liability for the conditional asset retirement obligation if the fair value of the obligation can be reasonably estimated 
fin is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks as part of our ongoing business operations  including risks from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates that could impact our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we manage our exposure to these and other market risks through regular operating and financing activities 
we may use derivative financial instruments on a limited basis as additional risk management tools and not for speculative investment purposes 
interest rate risk in may  we issued a floating rate note with a principal amount of million 
embedded within the promissory note agreement is an interest rate cap protecting one half of the million borrowed 
the embedded interest rate cap limits to the month euribor interest rate that we must pay on the promissory note 
we paid approximately million to purchase the interest rate cap 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the embedded interest rate cap is considered to be clearly and closely related to the debt of the host contract and is not required to be separated and accounted for separately from the host contract 
we are accounting for the hybrid contract  comprised of the variable rate note and the embedded interest rate cap  as a single debt instrument 
at september   the fair value of this instrument is nominal 
essentially all of our other outstanding debt is variable rate debt 
we are exposed to risks of rising interest rates  which could result in rising interest costs 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations 
these risks include the translation of local currency balances of our foreign subsidiaries  intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through our normal operating activities and  if we deem it appropriate  we may consider utilizing foreign currency forward contracts in the future 
for fiscal  we estimate that approximately of our total revenues were derived from customers outside of the united states  with approximately of our total revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we estimate that revenue and operating expenses for fiscal were lower by million and million  respectively  as a result of changes in exchange rates compared to fiscal at september   we had million of working capital denominated in foreign currencies 
at september   we had no outstanding foreign currency forward contracts 
the following table shows the approximate split of these foreign currency exposures by principal currency at september  euro british pound swiss franc total exposure revenues operating expenses working capital a hypothetical strengthening of the us dollar during fiscal versus the foreign currencies in which we have exposure would have reduced revenue by approximately million and reduced operating expenses by approximately million  resulting in a million improvement in our operating loss as compared to what was actually reported 
working capital at september   would have been approximately million lower than actually reported  if we had used this hypothetical stronger us dollar 
these numbers were estimated using the different hypothetical rate for the entire year and applying it evenly to all non us dollar transactions 
inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations for fiscal however  we cannot assure you that future inflation would not have an adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition
