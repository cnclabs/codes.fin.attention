critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and general practices within the financial services industry 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company considers that the determination of the allowance for loan losses involves a higher degree of judgment and complexity than its other significant accounting policies 
the allowance for loan losses is calculated with the objective of maintaining an allowance level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance is based on periodic evaluations of the loan portfolio and other relevant factors 
however  this evaluation is inherently subjective as it requires material estimates  including  among others  expected default probabilities  loss once loans default  expected commitment usage  the amounts and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  value of collateral  estimated losses  and general amounts for historical loss experience 
the process also considers economic conditions  uncertainties in estimating losses and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
all of these factors may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provisions for loan losses may be required that would adversely impact earnings in future periods 

next page additional discussion of the allowance for loan losses is included in the company s annual report on form k for the year ended december   under the section titled item business allowances for losses on loans and foreclosed assets 
judgments and assumptions used by management in the past have resulted in an overall allowance for loan losses that has been sufficient to absorb estimated loan losses 
inherent in this process is the evaluation of individual significant credit relationships 
from time to time certain credit relationships may deteriorate due to payment performance  cash flow of the borrower  value of collateral  or other factors 
in these instances  management may have to revise its loss estimates and assumptions for these specific credits due to changing circumstances 
in some cases  additional losses may be realized  in other instances  the factors that led to the deterioration may improve or the credit may be refinanced elsewhere and allocated allowances may be released from the particular credit 
for the periods included in these financial statements  management s overall methodology for evaluating the allowance for loan losses has not changed significantly 
stock split all share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend declared in may general the profitability of the company and  more specifically  the profitability of its primary subsidiary  great southern bank  depends primarily on its net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income it earns on its loans and investment portfolio  and the interest it pays on interest bearing liabilities  which consists mainly of interest paid on deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is affected by the relative amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the interest rates earned or paid on these balances 
when interest earning assets approximate or exceed interest bearing liabilities  any positive interest rate spread will generate net interest income 
in the year ended december   the company s total loans increased million  or 
as loan demand is affected by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions  and because of the competition we face  we cannot be assured that our loan growth will match or exceed the level of increases achieved in prior years 
if economic conditions do not deteriorate  we believe that we are well positioned to continue to originate a substantial amount of loans in our southwest missouri market as well as our loan production markets of st 
louis  kansas city  central missouri and northwest arkansas 
in addition  we may consider other markets in which to establish loan production offices 
we expect that the majority of our loan portfolio growth will continue to be in the residential and commercial construction and commercial real estate loan categories 
in the year ended december   residential and commercial construction loan balances increased million 
in  our new loan production remained strong  however  we experienced the repayment in total of several commercial real estate and residential and commercial construction loans 
we expect this trend in production and repayments to continue in  limiting growth in our loan portfolio to an amount that could be below our recent historical average 
in addition  the level of non performing loans and foreclosed assets may affect our net interest income and net income 
while the company has not historically had an overall high level of charge offs on non performing loans  the company does not accrue interest income on these loans and does not recognize interest income until the loan is repaid or interest payments have been made for a period of time sufficient to provide evidence of performance on the loan 
generally  the higher the level of non performing assets  the greater the negative impact on interest income and net income 

next page loan growth continued in our loan production offices lpo 
many of these loans originated by our lpos are construction loans where the customer has yet to draw the full line 
in the year ended december   the overland park  kansas lpo originated loans totaling million with outstanding loan balances of million at december  in the year ended december   the rogers  arkansas lpo originated loans totaling million with outstanding loan balances of million at december  in the year ended december   the st 
louis lpo originated loans totaling million with outstanding loan balances of million at december  the columbia lpo  which began operating in march and serves the columbia  jefferson city  and lake of the ozarks  mo  region  originated million of loans with outstanding loan balances of million at december  approximately two thirds of the million total outstanding balance was originated by lenders in springfield or the lake of the ozarks prior to opening the lpo in columbia 
the company attracts deposit accounts through our retail branch network  correspondent banking and corporate services areas  and brokered deposits 
the company then utilizes these deposit funds  along with fhlbank advances  to meet loan demand from existing and new customers 
in the year ended december   total deposit balances increased million 
of this total increase  brokered certificate balances increased million  customer checking accounts increased million and retail certificates of deposit increased million 
as the generation of increased net interest income is critical to the growth of great southern s earnings  the continued ability to attract deposits or generate other funding sources is very important to successful loan growth 
there is a high level of competition for deposits in our markets 
while it is our goal to gain checking account and certificate of deposit market share in our branch footprint  we cannot be assured of this in future periods 
our ability to fund growth in future periods may also be dependent on our ability to continue to access brokered deposits and fhlbank advances 
in times when our loan demand has outpaced our generation of new deposits  we have utilized brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund these loans 
in the year ended december   the outstanding balance of fhlbank advances decreased million due to deposit growth and increases in brokered certificates 
these types of funding have been attractive to us because we can create variable rate funding which more closely matches the variable rate nature of much of our loan portfolio 
while we do not currently anticipate that our ability to access these funding sources will be reduced or eliminated in future periods  if this should happen  the limitation on our ability to fund additional loans would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our net interest income may be affected positively or negatively by market interest rate changes 
a large portion of our loan portfolio is tied to the prime rate and adjusts immediately when this rate adjusts 
we also have a large portion of our liabilities that will reprice with changes to the federal funds rate or the three month libor rate 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate changes on an ongoing basis see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
while we currently believe that neither increases nor decreases in market interest rates will materially adversely impact our net interest income  circumstances could change which may alter that outlook 
ongoing changes in the level and shape of the interest rate yield curve pose challenges for interest rate risk management 
beginning in  market interest rates were in a downward trend  settling at historically low levels from late through early during this period  great southern was able to effectively manage its interest rate risk and maintain its net interest margin at fairly stable levels 

next page beginning in the second half of and through june   the board of governors of the frb increased short term interest rates through steady increases in the federal funds rate 
other short term rates  such as libor and short term u 
s 
treasury rates  increased in conjunction with these increases by the frb 
by december   the frb had raised the federal funds rates by from in june and other short term rates rose by corresponding amounts 
however  there was not a parallel shift in the yield curve  intermediate and long term interest rates did not increase at a corresponding pace 
this caused the shape of the interest rate yield curve to become much flatter  which creates different issues for interest rate risk management 
in addition  during this period  great southern s net interest margin was negatively affected by certain characteristics of some of its loans  deposit mix  loan and deposit pricing by competitors  and timing of interest rate increases by the frb as compared to interest rate increases in the financial markets 
during  great southern s net interest margin was fairly stable and improved slightly compared to generally  the flattening interest rate yield curve has hurt great southern s ability to reinvest proceeds from loan and investment repayments at higher rates 
the company s cost of funds has increased faster than its yield on loans and investments in part because of aggressive pricing of deposits by competitors in local markets 
great southern has increased rates on checking  money market and retail certificate accounts in order to remain competitive  while not leading the market 
great southern s deposit mix has also led to more rapidly increasing interest rates 
the company has significant balances in high dollar money market and premium now accounts  the owners of which are very rate sensitive and compare these products to other bank and non bank products available by competing financial services companies 
in addition  nearly all of great southern s brokered certificates of deposit are subject to interest rate swaps which create variable rate funding based on three month libor 
as the market anticipates rate increases or decreases by the frb  libor rates tend to increase ahead of the frb federal funds rate increases 
the rate earned on the portion of the company s loan portfolio which is tied to the prime rate of interest only increases when the frb actually increases the federal funds rate 
margin compression has also occurred in the company s investment securities portfolio 
the company added securities in and to pledge as collateral to secure public funds deposits and customer reverse repurchase agreements 
the interest rates paid to these customers has increased consistent with short term market interest rate increases  while the overall yield on the investment portfolio has not increased as rapidly from december  to december  in and  the company earned a greater spread on these securities due to the very low rate environment and the then steeper interest rate yield curve compared to and as borrowing costs have increased  the spread earned on these securities has decreased 
the company has also repositioned some of its investment portfolio over time to shorten the time frame its securities will reprice  resulting in lower interest rate yields currently 
at december   the company also had a portfolio of prime based loans totaling approximately billion with rates that change immediately with changes to the prime rate of interest 
of this total  million represented loans which had interest rate floors 
these floors were at varying rates  with million of these loans having floor rates of or greater and another million of these loans having floor rates between and 
during and  the company s loan portfolio had loans with rate floors that were much lower 
however  since market interest rates were also much lower at that time  these loan rate floors went into effect and established a loan rate which was higher than the contractual rate would have otherwise been 
this contributed to a loan yield for the entire portfolio which was approximately and basis points higher than the prime rate of interest at december  and  respectively 
as interest rates rose in the second half of and throughout and  these interest rate floors were exceeded and the loans reverted back to their normal contractual interest rate terms 
at december   the loan yield for the portfolio was approximately basis points higher than the prime rate of interest  resulting in lower interest rate margins 
at december   the loan portfolio yield was approximately basis points lower than the prime rate of interest 

next page the company s profitability is also affected by the level of its non interest income and operating expenses 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges and atm fees  commissions earned by our travel  insurance and investment divisions  late charges and prepayment fees on loans  gains on sales of loans and available for sale investments and other general operating income 
non interest income is also affected by the company s hedging activities 
operating expenses consist primarily of salaries and employee benefits  occupancy related expenses  postage  insurance  advertising and public relations  telephone  professional fees  office expenses and other general operating expenses 
in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   non interest income increased due to increases in service charges and overdraft fees and increases in commission revenues from our travel  insurance and investment divisions 
fees from service charges and overdrafts will likely increase modestly in compared to as we expect that retail checking accounts will grow at a modest pace in we expect to continue to add checking balances  however  much of this growth is expected to come from additional corporate and correspondent banking relationships which will not generate as much fee income as smaller individual checking accounts 
the level of commission revenue is likely to remain above levels in  assuming no substantial shocks occur in the financial markets or the travel industry 
in  the company completed its acquisitions of a travel company in lee s summit  missouri and a second travel company in columbia  missouri 
the investment division experienced a decrease in revenues in  primarily related to lower sales of annuity products 
one additional item that decreased non interest income in the year ended december  was the impairment write down in value of one available for sale security  totaling  non interest income was also significantly affected by the company s restatement in for certain interest rate swaps  which significantly impacted prior period results 
non interest income decreased million in the year ended december   and increased million in the year ended december   as a result of the change in the fair value of certain interest rate swaps 
in addition  non interest income for was also impacted by the reclassification of the net interest settlements on these swaps from net interest income to non interest income 
while this had no effect on total net income  non interest income was increased by million in the year ended december  there was no reclassification of net interest settlements in the year ended december  in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   operating expenses increased primarily in the category of salaries and benefits expense  with smaller increases and decreases in some of the other expense categories such as occupancy and equipment expense  postage  telephone and others 
we anticipate that increases will occur again in  at a moderate level  with regard to employee costs and occupancy expenses as we continue to add new banking centers to serve new and existing customers 
we anticipate that expense increases in will be fairly consistent with the expense increases recorded in employee costs and occupancy expenses may increase as we have added new banking centers in southwest missouri to serve new and existing customers and support growth in lending and operational areas 
in the third quarter of  we opened our first full service banking center location in lee s summit  missouri  in the kansas city market 
in addition  in  we opened a loan production office in columbia  missouri  to serve new and existing customers in the central missouri area 
we anticipate that lending opportunities will continue to increase in our existing loan production offices in st 
louis  kansas city  columbia and northwest arkansas and we will increase staffing as needed in these offices to meet demand for commercial and residential loans 

next page the operations of the bank  and banking institutions in general  are significantly influenced by general economic conditions and related monetary and fiscal policies of regulatory agencies 
deposit flows and the cost of deposits and borrowings are influenced by interest rates on competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for financing real estate and other types of loans  which in turn are affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and other factors affecting loan demand and the availability of funds 
in the third quarter of  the company expanded its retail banking center network from to offices 
great southern opened a banking center in lee s summit  mo  a growing kansas city area community 
this banking center marks the company s first retail banking presence in the region and complements services already provided in the area a great southern travel office in lee s summit and an overland park  kan 
based loan production office serving the metropolitan kansas city market 
the company also opened a banking center near springfield in ozark  mo  the second great southern location in this growing southwest missouri community 
great southern expects to open two to three new banking centers annually over the next few years 
effect of federal laws and regulations federal legislation and regulation significantly affect the banking operations of the company and the bank  and have increased competition among commercial banks  savings institutions  mortgage banking enterprises and other financial institutions 
in particular  the capital requirements and operations of regulated depository institutions such as the company and the bank have been and will be subject to changes in applicable statutes and regulations from time to time  which changes could  under certain circumstances  adversely affect the company or the bank

 fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosure related to the use of fair value measures in financial statements 
this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements  and does not expand the use of fair value measures in financial statements  but standardizes its definition and guidance in generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement based on an exchange transaction between market participants in which an entity sells an asset or transfers a liability 
sfas no 
also establishes a fair value hierarchy from observable market data as the highest level to fair value based on an entity s own fair value assumptions as the lowest level

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
provides companies with the option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
under the option  any changes in fair value would be included in earnings 
this statement seeks to reduce both complexity in accounting and volatility in earnings caused by differences in the existing accounting rules 
existing accounting principles use different measurement attributes for different assets and liabilities  which can lead to earnings volatility 
sfas no 
helps to mitigate this type of accounting induced volatility by enabling companies to achieve a more consistent accounting for changes in the fair value of related assets and liabilities without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
under this statement  entities may measure at fair value financial assets and liabilities selected on a contract by contract basis 
they would be required to display those values separately from those measured under different attributes on the face of the statement of financial condition 
furthermore  companies must provide additional information that would help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect on earnings 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   with earlier application permitted if the company makes this election for its first fiscal quarter in the fiscal year 
if the company adopts sfas no

the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 
the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on current economic conditions

provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses the provision for loan losses was million and million during the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the allowance for loan losses increased million  or  at december  compared to december  management records a provision for loan losses in an amount it believes sufficient to result in an allowance for loan losses that will cover current net charge offs as well as risks believed to be inherent in the loan portfolio of the bank 
the amount of provision charged against current income is based on several factors  including  but not limited to  past loss experience  current portfolio mix  actual and potential losses identified in the loan portfolio  economic conditions  regular reviews by internal staff and regulatory examinations 
weak economic conditions  higher inflation or interest rates  or other factors may lead to increased losses in the portfolio 
management has established various controls in an attempt to limit future losses  such as a watch list of possible problem loans  documented loan administration policies and a loan review staff to review the quality and anticipated collectibility of the portfolio 
management determines which loans are potentially uncollectible  or represent a greater risk of loss and makes additional provisions to expense  if necessary  to maintain the allowance at a satisfactory level 

next page the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio at this time  based on current economic conditions 
if economic conditions deteriorate significantly  it is possible that additional assets would be classified as non performing  and accordingly  an additional provision for losses would be required  thereby adversely affecting future results of operations and financial condition 
non performing assets as a result of continued growth in the loan portfolio  changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time  and other factors specific to a borrower s circumstances  the level of non performing assets will fluctuate 
non performing assets at december   were million  up million from december  non performing assets as a percentage of total assets were 
at december  compared to december   nonperforming loans increased million to million while foreclosed assets decreased million to  commercial real estate and business loans comprised million  or  of the total million of non performing loans at december  commercial real estate and business loans historically comprise the majority of non performing loans 
non performing loans 
non performing loans increased primarily as a result of the addition of eight unrelated loan relationships to the non performing category since december  the first relationship totals million and is secured primarily by a completed office building and five houses under construction in the branson  missouri  area 
these loans are part of a larger relationship which  at december   totaled million 
the remainder of this relationship was included in the potential problem loans category at december  the second relationship totals  and is secured primarily by several single family houses that are completed or under construction in northwest arkansas 
this relationship was reduced from million at december   when it was included in potential problem loans  through the sale of some of the houses that have been completed 
subsequent to december   the loans paid down another  to  the third relationship totals  and is secured primarily by a mobile home park in the kansas city  missouri  metropolitan area 
the fourth relationship totals  and is secured primarily by the receivables  inventory  equipment and other business assets of a home building materials company in springfield  missouri 
the fifth relationship totals million and is secured primarily by a nursing home in missouri 
this nursing home has experienced cash flow problems recently 
this relationship is part of a total million relationship 
the remainder of this relationship is included in potential problem loans at december  the sixth relationship totals million and is secured by commercial real estate of an automobile dealership and additional commercial and residential real estate collateral in missouri 
during the quarter ended september   the loan relationship balance was reduced  to million  through a charge off against the allowance for loan losses 
subsequent to december   the borrower has sold the automobile dealership 
this sale reduced the relationship balance by approximately million 
the seventh relationship totals million and is secured by commercial real estate and equipment of two restaurants one in springfield and one in central missouri 
the restaurant in springfield has been closed and the building and land are currently offered for sale 
the eighth relationship totals  and is secured by a motel near branson  missouri and additional commercial real estate collateral 
at december   the significant relationships described above accounted for million of the non performing loan total 
foreclosed assets 
of the total  of foreclosed assets at december   foreclosed real estate totaled  and repossessed automobiles  boats and other personal property totaled  during the latter portion of  the company sold almost all of its foreclosed real estate assets in separate transactions to unrelated buyers 
at december   there were no foreclosed assets in excess of  individually 

next page potential problem loans 
potential problem loans decreased million during the year ended december  from million at december  to million at december  potential problem loans are loans which management has identified through routine internal review procedures as having possible credit problems which may cause the borrowers difficulty in complying with current repayment terms 
these loans are not reflected in the non performing assets 
during the year ended december   potential problem loans decreased primarily due to the transfer to the non performing loan category portions of three unrelated loan relationships and the removal of one relationship from potential problem loan status due to loan balance reductions and improvements to the credit relationship 
at december   four large unrelated relationships make up the majority of the potential problem loan category 
the first relationship totals million with an additional million included in non performing loans and is secured primarily by vacant land  developed and undeveloped residential subdivisions  and single family houses used as rental property in the branson  missouri  area 
this relationship was described as a million relationship in the september quarterly report on form q in the category potential problem loans 
during the three months ended december    was moved from potential problem loans to non performing loans and the relationship was reduced  through payments by the borrower 
the second relationship totals million and is secured primarily by a motel in the state of illinois and additional real estate collateral 
the motel began operations in early and is currently offered for sale 
the third relationship totals million in potential problem loans with an additional million included in non performing loans and is secured primarily by a nursing home in the springfield  missouri area 
the fourth relationship totals million and is secured primarily by a townhome development in the kansas city  missouri area 
the project has experienced cash flow problems recently due to vacancies in some of the units 
several of the tenants were military personnel who have been redeployed to other locations 
the project is currently offered for sale 
at december   the significant relationships described above accounted for million of the potential problem loan total 
non interest income including the effects of the company s restatement for interest rate swaps  total non interest income decreased million  or  in the year ended december  when compared to the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to i a negative change in the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps of million  from a positive million to a negative million  as a result of changes in related market interest rates  ii a decrease in the amount of interest rate swap net settlements received from counter parties of million  and iii an increase in the net realized loss on sales and impairments of available for sale securities in of  during  the company determined that the impairment of one security with an original cost of million had become other than temporary 
consequently  the company recorded a  charge to income 
additionally in  the company realized a gain of  on the sale of land that had been previously purchased for a branch location 
after completion of the branch  most of the remaining land was sold 
the changes described above were partially offset by i an increase in service charges and atm point of sale fees of  or  ii an increase in commissions revenue in the company s investment  travel and insurance divisions of  or  iii an increase in late charges and prepayment penalties on loans of  or  and iv smaller increases and decreases in loan and commitment fees  loan servicing income  and merchant card fees 
the increase in service charges and fees resulted from a larger number of accounts and a higher level of insufficient funds transactions by customers 
the increase in atm point of sale fees was related to increases in overall usage by customers  primarily in point of sale usage 
increases in commission revenues occurred in the travel and investments divisions 
in the latter half of  the company acquired two travel agencies in the springfield  missouri market and  in mid  we acquired a travel agency in columbia  missouri 
the operations of these agencies  along with organic growth in our existing travel operations  have led to increased revenue in both the leisure and corporate travel areas 
in late  we began to implement some strategic sales initiatives in our investment division and throughout our branch network 
increased sales of a variety of investment products were realized during as a result of these initiatives 
while loan prepayments occur from time to time  in  a few unrelated borrowers elected to pay off some or all of their loans prior to the contractual maturity  with the company receiving large prepayment penalties on those loans that allowed for penalties as part of the borrowing agreements 
the company includes prepayment penalties in many of its loans  however  there is no way to estimate the level or timing of prepayment penalties that may be realized in future periods

additionally  there were smaller increases and decreases in other non interest expense areas  such as postage  advertising  insurance  legal and professional fees  and bank charges and fees related to additional correspondent and customer relationships 
provision for income taxes provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income decreased from for the year ended december   to for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to higher balances and rates of tax exempt investment securities and loans  federal tax credits and deductions for stock options exercised by certain employees 
for future periods  the company expects the effective tax rate to be in the range of of pre tax net income

statements of cash flows 
during the years ended december   and  the company had positive cash flows from operating activities and positive cash flows from financing activities 
the company experienced negative cash flows from investing activities during each of these same time periods 
cash flows from operating activities for the periods covered by the statements of cash flows have been primarily related to changes in accrued and deferred assets  credits and other liabilities  the provision for loan losses  depreciation  and the amortization of deferred loan origination fees and discounts premiums on loans and investments  all of which are non cash or non operating adjustments to operating cash flows

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk asset and liability management and market risk a principal operating objective of the company is to produce stable earnings by achieving a favorable interest rate spread that can be sustained during fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
the company has sought to reduce its exposure to adverse changes in interest rates by attempting to achieve a closer match between the periods in which its interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets can be expected to reprice through the origination of adjustable rate mortgages and loans with shorter terms to maturity and the purchase of other shorter term interest earning assets 
since the company uses laddered brokered deposits and fhlbank advances to fund a portion of its loan growth  the company s assets tend to reprice more quickly than its liabilities 
our risk when interest rates change the rates of interest we earn on assets and pay on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
market interest rates change over time 
accordingly  our results of operations  like those of other financial institutions  are impacted by changes in interest rates and the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities 
the risk associated with changes in interest rates and our ability to adapt to these changes is known as interest rate risk and is our most significant market risk 
how we measure the risk to us associated with interest rate changes in an attempt to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates and comply with applicable regulations  we monitor great southern s interest rate risk 
in monitoring interest rate risk we regularly analyze and manage assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates  the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to actual or potential changes in market interest rates 
the ability to maximize net interest income is largely dependent upon the achievement of a positive interest rate spread that can be sustained despite fluctuations in prevailing interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity is a measure of the difference between amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities which either reprice or mature within a given period of time 
the difference  or the interest rate repricing gap  provides an indication of the extent to which an institution s interest rate spread will be affected by changes in interest rates 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities repricing during the same period  and is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets during the same period 
generally  during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap within shorter repricing periods would adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap within shorter repricing periods would result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  the opposite would be true 
as of december   great southern s internal interest rate risk models indicate a one year interest rate sensitivity gap that is close to neutral 

next page interest rate risk exposure estimates the sensitivity gap are not exact measures of an institution s actual interest rate risk 
they are only indicators of interest rate risk exposure produced in a simplified modeling environment designed to allow management to gauge the bank s sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
they do not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the bank s net interest income because the repricing of certain categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive and other factors beyond the bank s control 
as a result  certain assets and liabilities indicated as maturing or otherwise repricing within a stated period may in fact mature or reprice at different times and in different amounts and cause a change  which potentially could be material  in the bank s interest rate risk 
in order to minimize the potential for adverse effects of material and prolonged increases and decreases in interest rates on great southern s results of operations  great southern has adopted asset and liability management policies to better match the maturities and repricing terms of great southern s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
management recommends and the board of directors sets the asset and liability policies of great southern which are implemented by the asset and liability committee 
the asset and liability committee is chaired by the chief financial officer and is comprised of members of great southern s senior management 
the purpose of the asset and liability committee is to communicate  coordinate and control asset liability management consistent with great southern s business plan and board approved policies 
the asset and liability committee establishes and monitors the volume and mix of assets and funding sources taking into account relative costs and spreads  interest rate sensitivity and liquidity needs 
the objectives are to manage assets and funding sources to produce results that are consistent with liquidity  capital adequacy  growth  risk and profitability goals 
the asset and liability committee meets on a monthly basis to review  among other things  economic conditions and interest rate outlook  current and projected liquidity needs and capital positions and anticipated changes in the volume and mix of assets and liabilities 
at each meeting  the asset and liability committee recommends appropriate strategy changes based on this review 
the chief financial officer or his designee is responsible for reviewing and reporting on the effects of the policy implementations and strategies to the board of directors at their monthly meetings 
in order to manage its assets and liabilities and achieve the desired liquidity  credit quality  interest rate risk  profitability and capital targets  great southern has focused its strategies on originating adjustable rate loans  and managing its deposits and borrowings to establish stable relationships with both retail customers and wholesale funding sources 
at times  depending on the level of general interest rates  the relationship between long and short term interest rates  market conditions and competitive factors  we may determine to increase our interest rate risk position somewhat in order to maintain or increase our net interest margin 
the asset and liability committee regularly reviews interest rate risk by forecasting the impact of alternative interest rate environments on net interest income and market value of portfolio equity  which is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments  and evaluating such impacts against the maximum potential changes in net interest income and market value of portfolio equity that are authorized by the board of directors of great southern

interest rate swaps are carried at fair value  estimated using quoted dealer prices  and are recognized in the statement of financial condition in the prepaid expenses and other assets or accounts payable and accrued expenses caption 
the company uses interest rate swaps to help manage its interest rate risks from recorded financial liabilities 
these instruments are utilized when they can be demonstrated to effectively hedge a designated liability and the liability exposes the company to interest rate risk 
for those interest rate swaps which meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment  amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swaps are accounted for on the accrual basis and recognized as interest income or expense of the related liability 
for those interest rate swaps which do not meet the requirements for hedge accounting treatment  amounts to be paid or received under interest rate swaps are accounted for on the accrual basis and recognized as noninterest income 
gains and losses on early termination of these instruments are deferred and amortized as an adjustment to the yield on the related liability over the shorter of the remaining contract life or the maturity of the related asset or liability 
if the related liability is sold or otherwise liquidated  the instrument is marked to market  with the resultant gains and losses recognized in noninterest income 
the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements with the objective of economically hedging against the effects of changes in the fair value of its liabilities for fixed rate brokered certificates of deposit and subordinated debentures issued to capital trust caused by changes in market interest rates 
the swap agreements generally provide for the company to pay a variable rate of interest based on a spread to the one month or three month london interbank offering rate libor and to receive a fixed rate of interest equal to that of the hedged instrument 
under the swap agreements the company is to pay or receive interest monthly  quarterly  semiannually or at maturity
