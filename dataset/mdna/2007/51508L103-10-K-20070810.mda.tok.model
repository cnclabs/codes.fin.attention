item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following presents an analysis of the results and financial condition of our continuing operations 
except where indicated otherwise  the results of discontinued operations are excluded from this discussion 
we primarily own and operate full service  casual dining restaurants and two casinos 
as of december   we operated full service restaurants 
in addition to these units  there were several limited menu restaurants and other properties as described in item business  and the golden nugget hotels and casinos in las vegas and laughlin  nevada as more fully described below 
during  as part of a strategic review of our operations  we initiated a plan to divest certain restaurants  including joe s crab shack units 
results of operations for all units included in the disposal plan have been reclassified to discontinued operations in the statements of income for all periods presented 
on november   we completed the sale of joe s crab shack restaurants to jcs holdings  llc  an unaffiliated new entity created by jh whitney capital partners  llc for approximately million  including the assumption of certain working capital liabilities to be finalized in in connection with the sale  we recorded pre tax impairment charges and other losses totaling million million after tax 
under the terms of the sale  we are providing jcs holdings  llc transitional support services for a period not expected to exceed twelve months 
these services include  among other things  it and purchasing support  as well as office space 
following cessation of these activities  we do not anticipate any significant continuing involvement with or cash flows from jcs holdings  llc 
we recorded additional pre tax impairment charges totaling million for the year ended december  to write down carrying values of assets pertaining to the remaining stores included in our disposal plan 
we expect to sell the land and improvements belonging to these remaining restaurants  or abandon those locations  within the next to months 

table of contents in connection with our strategic review  we also identified certain restaurants that we believe are suitable for conversion into other landry s concepts 
as a result of this review  we took a charge of million to impair certain assets relating to these conversion units to reflect our best estimates of their fair market value 
the results of operations for these restaurants are included in continuing operations 
on september   landry s gaming  inc  an unrestricted subsidiary  purchased the golden nugget hotels and casinos in downtown las vegas and laughlin  nevada gn for million in cash  the assumption of million of senior secured notes due and the assumption of approximately million under an existing senior revolving credit facility and the further assumption of certain working capital including million in cash 
under the terms of the purchase agreement  the currently outstanding senior secured notes due remain outstanding obligations of gn following the closing 
the golden nugget las vegas occupies approximately eight acres in downtown las vegas with approximately  square feet of gaming area 
the property also features three towers containing  rooms  the largest number of guestrooms in downtown las vegas 
the golden nugget laughlin is located on acres on the colorado river with  square feet of gaming space and rooms 
the results of operations for these properties are included in our financial statements from the date of acquisition 
the specialty growth division is primarily engaged in operating complementary entertainment and hospitality activities  such as miscellaneous beverage carts and various kiosks  amusement rides and games and some associated limited hotel properties  generally at locations in conjunction with our core restaurant operations 
the total assets  revenues  and operating profits of these complementary specialty business activities are considered not material to the overall business and below the threshold of a separate reportable business segment under sfas no 
we are in the business of operating restaurants  two casinos and the above mentioned complementary activities 
we do not engage in real estate operations other than those associated with the ownership and operation of our business 
we own a fee interest own the land and building in a number of properties underlying our businesses  but do not engage in real estate sales or real estate management in any significant fashion or format 
the chief executive officer  who is responsible for our operations  reviews and evaluates both core and non core business activities and results  and determines financial and management resource allocations and investments for all business activities 
the restaurant and gaming industries are intensely competitive and affected by changes in consumer tastes and by national  regional  and local economic conditions and demographic trends 
the performance of individual restaurants or casinos may be affected by factors such as traffic patterns  demographic considerations  marketing  weather conditions  and the type  number  and location of competing restaurants and casinos 
we have many well established competitors with greater financial resources  larger marketing and advertising budgets  and longer histories of operation than ours  including competitors already established in regions where we are planning to expand  as well as competitors planning to expand in the same regions 
we face significant competition from other casinos in the markets in which we operate and from other mid priced  full service  casual dining restaurants offering or promoting seafood and other types and varieties of cuisine 
our competitors include national  regional  and local restaurant chains and casinos as well as local owner operated restaurants and casinos 
we also compete with other restaurants  retail establishments and gaming companies for restaurant and casino sites 
we intend to pursue an acquisition strategy

asset impairment expense of approximately million relating to one underperforming restaurant was recorded for the charge was taken due to sales declines combined with deterioration in this particular restaurant s profitability and management s lowered outlook for improvement in the specific property 
assets that were impaired were primarily leasehold improvements and to a lesser extent equipment 
no asset impairment was recorded in restaurant pre opening expenses were  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease for the period was attributable to a decrease in units opened in as compared to the increase in net interest expense for the year ended december  as compared to the prior year is primarily due to higher borrowings  as well as an increase in our average borrowing rate 

table of contents other income  net for was immaterial 
other expense  net for was  and was comprised primarily of million in pre payment penalties and related fees associated with the pay down of our million senior notes and bank credit facility  both of which were entered into in  partially offset by million in business interruption insurance recoveries 
provision for income taxes increased by  to  in the year ended december  compared to a tax benefit of  in in we generated a net million income tax benefit from the reversal of the remaining valuation allowance attributable to tax benefits associated with the rainforest cafe acquisition deemed realizable 
the previously established valuation allowance was reversed at december   due to the strong and future forecasted profitability of the rainforest cafe restaurants  a successful transition from a tax loss incurring stand alone public company to a highly profitable and taxable income producing wholly owned subsidiary  coupled with the approaching end of specific recognition limitations on allowable deductions and tax assets and the resolution of certain tax issues  which caused management to believe the remaining deferred tax assets previously reserved would more likely than not be realized 
liquidity and capital resources on july   we were notified by us bank  indenture trustee for our million senior notes  that such notes were accelerated  to be due and payable immediately as a result of our inability to file and deliver to the indenture trustee this form k pending completion of our stock option review 
we believe the attempt to accelerate is inappropriate and we have received a temporary restraining order tro from the us district federal court sitting in galveston county  texas requiring the trustee to rescind the acceleration pending a hearing on august  we believe we will be successful in obtaining a permanent rescission of the acceleration  or will negotiate a consent from the note holders or will obtain alternative financing sources 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining a permanent rescission of the accelerations  it is likely that any alternative financing will carry significantly higher interest rates and the associated higher interest expense 
furthermore  such alternative financing may well place substantially more restrictions on our ability to execute our strategies and business plan 
on june   our wholly owned unrestricted subsidiary  golden nugget  inc golden nugget  completed a new million credit facility consisting of a million first lien term loan which includes a million delayed draw component to finance the construction expansion at the golden nugget hotel and casino in las vegas  nevada  plus a million revolving credit facility  and a million second lien term loan with terms ranging from to years 
the first lien term loan bears interest at libor or the bank s base rate  plus a financing spread  for libor and 
for base rate borrowings 
in addition  the credit facility requires a commitment fee on the unfunded portion for both the million revolving credit facility and the million delayed draw term loan 
the financing spread and commitment fee for the revolving credit facility increases or decreases depending on the leverage ratio as defined in the credit facility 
the second lien term facility bears interest at libor or the bank s base rate  plus a financing spread  for libor and for base rate borrowings 
the second lien term facility matures on december  interest is paid quarterly 
both the first and second lien term loans are subject to customary banking covenants and conditions  including minimum ebitda  interest charge and financial leverage ratios  limitations on acquisitions  debt  investments and other restricted payments as defined in the credit facility  plus certain restrictions and conditions to access funds under the million delayed draw term loan to finance the construction expansion 
the credit facility provides for the payment of a one time dividend of up to million to the company or a designated subsidiary of the company representing repayment of amounts previously expended on the golden nugget 
the million will be available for acquisitions  debt repayment  stock repurchases and general corporate purposes 
on june   the proceeds from the new million credit facility were used to repay all of the golden nugget s outstanding debt  including its senior secured notes due totaling million  plus the outstanding balance of approximately million on its former million revolving credit facility with wells fargo foothill  inc in addition  the proceeds were used to pay associated tender premiums of 
table of contents approximately million due to the early redemption of the senior secured notes  plus accrued interest and related transaction fees and expenses 
in december  we refinanced our existing revolving credit facility and existing senior notes by entering into a new five year million bank credit facility and a six year million term loan 
in november  we utilized proceeds from the joe s sale to pay down approximately million on the term loan  leaving a balance outstanding of approximately million as of december  the bank credit facility matures in december and the term loan matures in december interest on the bank credit facility is payable monthly or quarterly at libor or the bank s base rate plus a financing spread 
interest on the term loan is payable quarterly at libor plus a financing spread 
the financing spread under the bank credit facility and the term loan is currently for libor borrowings and for base rate borrowings 
as of december   we had approximately million available under the existing credit facility for expansion and working capital purposes 
concurrent with the closing of the bank credit facility and term loan in december  we also issued million in senior notes through a private placement offering 
the senior notes are general unsecured obligations of the company and mature december interest is payable semi annually at 
on june   we completed an exchange offering whereby substantially all of the senior notes issued under the private placement were exchanged for senior notes registered under the securities act of net proceeds from the bank credit facility and senior notes totaled million and were used to repay all outstanding liabilities under the existing credit facility and senior notes 
these debt repayments resulted in a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of the bank credit facility and term loan are secured by substantially all real and personal property of subsidiaries and governed by certain financial covenants  including minimum fixed charge  net worth  and our financial leverage ratios as well as limitations on dividend payments  capital expenditures and other restricted payments as defined in the agreements 
a wholly owned subsidiary of ours assumed an million  non recourse  long term note payable due may in connection with an asset purchase in march principal and interest payments under this note aggregate  monthly 
working capital  excluding discontinued operations  increased from a deficit of million as of december  to a deficit of million as of december  primarily due to the purchase of the golden nugget hotels and casinos and repurchase of our common stock during cash flow to fund future operations  new restaurant development  stock repurchases  and acquisitions will be generated from operations  available capacity under our credit facility and additional financing  if appropriate 
from time to time  we review opportunities for restaurant acquisitions and investments in the hospitality  entertainment including gaming  amusement  food service and facilities management and other industries 
our exercise of any such investment opportunity may impact our development plans and capital expenditures 
we believe that adequate sources of capital are available to fund our business activities through december  as a primary result of our refinancing  we have incurred higher interest expense 
to manage our interest rate exposure  we entered into fair value hedges with a notional amount of million  whereby we swapped the fixed interest rate of the senior notes due for floating interest rates equal to six month libor plus a financing spread of to 
since april  we have paid an annual per share dividend  declared and paid in quarterly amounts 
we increased the annual dividend to per share in april 
table of contents in  we incurred million for capital expenditures including million on the remodel of the golden nugget hotel and casino in downtown las vegas  nevada  the opening of new restaurants and million on land for future development 
in  we also spent million to acquire an interest in the t rex restaurant 
in  we expect to incur approximately million  including opening units  million to complete the renovation and expansion of the golden nugget hotel and casino and approximately million on the construction of a new t rex and yak yeti s restaurant at two disney properties 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we had contractual obligations as described below 
these obligations are expected to be funded primarily through cash on hand  cash flow from operations  working capital  the bank credit facility and additional financing sources in the normal course of business operations 
our obligations include off balance sheet arrangements whereby the liabilities associated with non cancelable operating leases  unconditional purchase obligations and standby letters of credit are not fully reflected in our balance sheets 
contractual obligations total long term debt operating leases unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total cash obligations other commercial commitments line of credit standby letters of credit total commercial commitments total seasonality and quarterly results our business is seasonal in nature 
our reduced winter volumes cause revenues and  to a greater degree  operating profits to be lower in the first and fourth quarters than in other quarters 
we have and will continue to open restaurants in highly seasonal tourist markets 
periodically  our sales and profitability may be negatively affected by adverse weather 
the timing of unit openings can and will affect quarterly results 
critical accounting policies restaurant and other properties are reviewed on a property by property basis for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recovered 
the recoverability of properties that are to be held and used is measured by comparison of the estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset to the carrying amount of the asset 
goodwill and other non amortizing intangible assets are reviewed for impairment at least annually using estimates of future operating results 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  an impairment charge is recorded in the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
properties to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair values  reduced for estimated disposal costs  and are included in other current assets 

table of contents we operate approximately properties and periodically we expect to experience unanticipated individual unit deterioration in revenues and profitability  on a short term and occasionally longer term basis 
when such events occur and we determine that the associated assets are impaired  we will record an asset impairment expense in the quarter such determination is made 
due to our average restaurant net investment cost  excluding the owned land component  of approximately million  such amounts could be significant when and if they occur 
however  such asset impairment expense does not affect our financial liquidity  and is usually excluded from many valuation model calculations 
we maintain a large deductible insurance policy related to property  general liability and workers compensation coverage 
predetermined loss limits have been arranged with insurance companies to limit our per occurrence cash outlay 
accrued expenses and other liabilities include estimated costs to settle unpaid claims and estimated incurred but not reported claims using actuarial methodologies 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
we regularly assess the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets based on forecasts of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented and adjust the related valuation allowance if necessary 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
inherent in our determination of any necessary reserves are assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental 
we believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcome related to uncertain tax matters 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r  using the modified prospective application method 
under this transition method  we will record compensation expense for all stock option awards granted after the date of adoption and for the unvested portion of previously granted stock option awards that remain outstanding at the date of adoption 
the amount of compensation cost recognized was based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
under the provisions of sfas r  the recognition of unearned compensation  a contra equity account representing the amount of unrecognized restricted stock compensation expense  is no longer required 
therefore  in the first quarter of the unearned compensation amount that was included in our december  consolidated balance sheet in the amount of million was reduced to zero with a corresponding decrease to capital in excess of par value 
results for prior periods have not been restated upon adoption of r 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  the assessment of recoverability of long lived assets and costs to settle unpaid claims 
actual results may differ materially from those estimates 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken 
table of contents in a tax return  as well as guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on eitf issue no 
 how sales taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure 
eitf is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after december  we pay gross receipts tax on liquor sales in certain jurisdictions 
our policy is to present these taxes gross within revenues and expenses 
the adoption of eitf will not have any effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in september  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab addresses the diversity in practice of quantifying and assessing materiality of financial statement errors 
it is effective for fiscal years ending after november  and allows for a one time transitional cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for errors that were not previously deemed material 
the adoption of sab did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected will be recognized in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  that the adoption of sfas will have on our consolidated financial statements 
impact of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a significant effect on our operations during the past several years 
we believe we have historically been able to pass on increased costs through menu price increases  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in the future 
future increases in labor costs  including expected future increases in federal and state minimum wages  energy costs  and land and construction costs could adversely affect our profitability and ability to expand 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks including risks related to potential adverse changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
we actively monitor exposure to market risk and continue to develop and utilize appropriate risk management techniques 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for trading or to speculate on changes in commodity prices 
interest rate risk total debt at december  included million of floating rate debt attributed to borrowings at an average interest rate of 
as a result  our annual interest cost in will fluctuate based on short term interest rates 

table of contents in connection with the senior notes due  we entered into two interest swap agreements with the objective of managing our exposure to interest rate risk and lowering interest expense 
the agreements were effective december and march  and mature in december for an aggregate notional amount of million 
the impact on annual cash flow of a ten percent change in the floating rate approximately would be approximately million annually based on the floating rate debt and other obligations outstanding at december   however  there are no assurances that possible rate changes would be limited to such amounts 
certain holders of our senior notes have attempted to accelerate the notes 
if we are unsuccessful in permanently rescinding the attempted acceleration  we will be required to obtain alternative financing which will result in higher interest rates
