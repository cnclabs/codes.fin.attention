table of contents income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization  and inventory reserves  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  or the company adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could materially impact its financial position and results of operations 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires that a company continually evaluate the necessity of establishing or changing a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets  depending on whether it is more likely than not that actual benefit of those assets will be realized in future periods 
as of december   the company had determined that it was more likely than not that the actual tax benefit of million of its deferred tax assets would not be realized 
the company had therefore recorded a cumulative million valuation allowance to reduce the net carrying value of these assets to zero for financial reporting purposes as of december  the valuation allowance was determined based on the company s review of its future estimated us taxable income levels and the estimated future stock option exercises 
included in this million valuation allowance was million related to the future tax benefit of us net operating losses generated by the exercise of non qualified stock options 
as required by sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  the company had originally recorded all million of these future tax benefits as increased additional paid in capital 
accordingly  when the company recorded a valuation allowance against these future tax benefits  the company also reduced additional paid in capital by million 
as required by sfas no 
 the company maintained this deferred tax asset valuation allowance until it determined  during  that it was more likely than not that it would realize the actual tax benefit of million of deferred tax assets for which a full valuation allowance had been previously provided 
the company made this determination based on the level of the company s actual us taxable income  the company s projected future us taxable income levels  the company s actual tax deduction from the exercise of non qualified stock options and the fact that the company s future tax deduction from the exercise of non qualified stock options would most likely be less than in the past as those options  which were significantly in the money  were expiring and exercised by december  the company therefore recorded  in  a million reduction in its deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
because this reduction in the valuation allowance included million related to the future tax benefit of us net operating losses generated by the exercise of non qualified stock options  the company also restored million to the company s additional paid in capital in  in accordance with sfas no 
and apb no 
the remaining balance was credited to goodwill related to an acquisition the company made in the company made the determination based on a review of the facts and circumstances at that time 
litigation as described in item of part i of this form k  the company is a party to various pending litigation matters 
with respect to each pending claim  management determines whether it can reasonably estimate whether a loss is probable and  if so  the probable range of that loss 
if and when management has determined  with respect to a particular claim  both that a loss is probable and that it can reasonably estimate the range of that loss  the company records a charge equal to either its best estimate of that loss or the lowest amount in that probable range of loss 
the company will disclose additional exposures when the range of loss is subject to considerable interpretation 
with respect to the claims referenced in item  management of the company to date has been able to make this determination  and thus has recorded charges  with respect to the claims described under the heading hewlett packard company 
as developments occur in these matters and additional information becomes available  management of the company will reassess the probability of any losses and of their range  which may result in its recording charges or additional charges  which could materially impact the company s results of operation or financial position 

table of contents pension and other retirement benefits assumptions used in determining projected benefit obligations and the fair values of plan assets for the company s pension plans and other retirement benefits are evaluated periodically by management in consultation with outside actuaries and investment advisors 
changes in assumptions are based on relevant company data 
critical assumptions  such as the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets are evaluated and updated annually 
the company has assumed that the expected long term rate of return on plan assets will be for its us defined benefit pension plan  which is the majority of the company s benefit obligation and expense 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate that reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
the company determined the discount rate based on the analysis of the mercer and citigroup pension discount curves for high quality investments and the moody s aa interest rate as of december  that best matched the timing of the plan s future cash flows for the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
once the interest rates were determined  the plan s cash flow was discounted at the spot interest rate back to the measurement date 
at december   the company determined this rate to be for the company s us defined benefit pension plan  which is the majority of the company s benefit obligation and expense 
retirement benefit plan discount rates are the same as those used by the company s defined benefit pension plan in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
a one quarter percentage point increase in the discount rate would decrease the company s net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan by approximately million 
a one quarter percentage point change in the assumed long term rate of return would impact the company s net periodic benefit cost for the us pension plan by approximately million 
stock based compensation the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  on january  this standard requires that all share based payments to employees be recognized in the statements of operations based on their fair values 
the company has used the black scholes model to determine the fair value of its stock option awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating stock price volatility and employee stock option exercise behaviors 
if actual results differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense and the company s results of operations could be materially impacted 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations is based on awards that ultimately are expected to vest  the amount of expense has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and the company employs different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r  the compensation expense that the company records in the future periods may differ significantly from what the company has recorded in the current period 
the company adopted the modified prospective transition method permitted under sfas no 
r and consequently has not adjusted results from prior years 
under the modified transition method  compensation costs associated with awards for now include expense relating to the remaining unvested awards granted prior to december  and the expense related to any awards issued subsequent to december  the company recognizes the expense using the straight line attribution method 
the after tax stock based compensation and the impact to diluted earnings per share of adopting sfas no

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company operates on a global basis and is exposed to the risk that its earnings  cash flows and stockholders equity could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
the company attempts to minimize its exposures by using certain financial instruments  for purposes other than trading  in accordance with the company s overall risk management guidelines 
the company is primarily exposed to currency exchange rate risk with respect to certain inter company balances  forecasted transactions and cash flow  and net assets denominated in euro  japanese yen and british pound 
the company manages its foreign currency exposures on a consolidated basis  which allows the company to analyze exposures globally and take into account offsetting exposures in certain balances 
in addition  the company utilizes derivative and non derivative financial instruments to further reduce the net exposure to currency fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to the risk that its earnings and cash flows could be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates 
the company s policy is to manage interest costs by using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt that management believes is appropriate 
at times  to manage this mix in a cost efficient manner  the company has periodically entered into interest rate swaps in which the company agrees to exchange  at specified 
table of contents intervals  the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed upon notional amount 
cash flow hedges the company uses interest rate swap agreements to hedge the risk to earnings associated with fluctuations in interest rates related to outstanding us dollar floating rate debt 
in the fourth quarter of  the company entered into a floating to fixed rate interest rate swap with a notional amount of million  to hedge floating rate debt related to the term loan facility of its outstanding debt  with a maturity date of june for the year ended december   the company recorded a cumulative net pre tax realized gain of million and  in december  the company closed out the swap  resulting in a pre tax gain of million

these agreements are designated as foreign currency hedges of a net investment in foreign operations 
any increase or decrease in the fair value of cross currency interest rate swap agreements  forward contracts or range forward contracts is offset by the change in the value of the hedged net assets of the company s consolidated foreign affiliates 
therefore  these derivative instruments are intended to serve as an effective hedge of certain foreign net assets of the company
