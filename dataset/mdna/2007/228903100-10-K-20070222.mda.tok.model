preservation services cryolife markets its preservation services to tissue procurement agencies  implanting physicians  and prospective tissue recipients 
the company works with tissue banks and organ procurement agencies to ensure consistent and continued availability of donated human tissue for transplant and educates physicians and prospective tissue recipients with respect to the benefits of cryopreserved human tissues 
procurement of tissue 
donated human tissue is procured from deceased human donors by organ procurement agencies and tissue banks 
after procurement  the tissue is packed and shipped  together with certain information about the tissue and its donor  to the company in accordance with the company s protocols 
the tissue is transported to the company s laboratory facilities via commercial airlines pursuant to arrangements with qualified courier services 
timely receipt of procured tissue is important  as tissue that is not received promptly cannot be cryopreserved successfully 
the procurement agency is reimbursed by the company for the costs associated with these procurement services 
the procurement fee and related shipping costs  together with the charges for the preservation services of the company  are ultimately paid to the company by the hospital with which the implanting physician is associated 
the company has developed relationships with approximately tissue banks and organ procurement agencies throughout the us management believes these relationships are critical in the preservation services industry and that the breadth of these existing relationships provides the company with a significant advantage over potential new entrants to this market 
the company employs approximately individuals in donor services to work with organ procurement agencies and tissue banks 
this includes five account managers who are stationed throughout the country to work directly with our customers 
the company s central office for procurement relations is staffed hours per day  days per year 
preservation of tissue 
upon receiving tissue  a company technician completes the documentation control for the tissue prepared by the procurement agency and gives it a control number 
the documentation identifies  among other things  donor age and cause of death 
a trained technician then removes the portion or portions of the delivered tissue that will be processed 
these procedures are conducted under aseptic conditions in clean rooms 
at the same time  samples are taken from the donated tissue and subjected to the company s quality assurance program 
this program  which includes review of the donor and tissue charts by cryolife s tissue quality assurance department and its medical directors  may identify characteristics which would disqualify the tissue for preservation or implantation 
once the tissue is approved  it is moved from quarantine to an implantable status 
tissue that does not pass testing is appropriately discarded 
cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopaedic tissues are cryopreserved in a proprietary freezing process conducted according to company protocols 
after the preservation process  the tissues are transferred to liquid nitrogen freezers for long term storage at temperatures at or below c 
the entire preservation process is controlled by guidelines established by the company 
distribution of tissue to implanting physicians 
after the tissue has cleared quality control assurance and the tissue is moved to an implantable status  the tissue is stored by the company or is delivered directly to hospitals at the implanting physician s request 
cryopreserved tissue must be transported under stringent handling conditions and maintained within specific temperature tolerances at all times 
cryopreserved tissue is packaged for shipment using the company s proprietary processes 
at the hospital the tissue is held in a liquid nitrogen freezer according to company protocols pending implantation 
the company provides a detailed protocol for thawing the cryopreserved tissue 
the company also makes its technical personnel available by phone or in person to answer questions 
after the company transports the tissue to the hospital  the company invoices the institution for its services  the procurement fee  and transportation costs 
the company provides company owned liquid nitrogen freezers to certain client hospitals 
the company has currently installed approximately of these freezers 
participating hospitals generally pay the cost of liquid nitrogen and regular maintenance 
the availability of on site freezers makes it easier for a hospital s physicians to utilize the company s preservation services by making the cryopreserved tissue more readily available 
because fees for the company s preservation services become due upon the shipment of tissue to the hospital  the use of such on site freezers also reduces the company s working capital needs 
marketing  educational  and technical support 
the company has records of over cardiovascular and vascular surgeons and over orthopaedic surgeons who have implanted tissues cryopreserved by the company during the past twelve months 
the company works to maintain relationships with and market to surgeons within these medical specialties 
because the company markets its preservation services directly to physicians  an important aspect of increasing the distribution of the company s preservation services is educating physicians on the use of cryopreserved human tissue and on proper implantation techniques 
trained field support personnel provide support to implanting institutions and surgeons 
the company currently employs approximately persons as technical service representatives and four region managers who deal primarily with cardiovascular and vascular surgeons and provide field support 
these representatives receive a base salary with a performance bonus 
the company currently has approximately independent technical service representatives and sub representatives who are employed by distributor groups who deal primarily with orthopaedic surgeons and who are paid on a commission basis 
the company sponsors physician training seminars where physicians teach other physicians the proper technique for handling and implanting cryopreserved human tissue 
the company also produces educational videotapes for physicians and coordinates live surgery demonstrations at various medical institutions 
in addition the company coordinates laboratory sessions that utilize animal tissue to demonstrate surgical techniques 
management believes that these activities improve the medical community s acceptance of the cryopreserved human tissue processed by the company and help to differentiate the company from other allograft processors 
to assist procurement agencies and tissue banks  the company provides educational materials and training on procurement  dissection  packaging  and shipping techniques 
the company also produces educational videotapes and coordinates laboratory sessions on procurement techniques for procurement agency personnel 
to supplement its educational activities  the company employs in house technical specialists that provide technical information and assistance  and maintains a staff hours per day  days per year for customer support 
bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices the company markets and distributes the cryolife o brien stentless aortic heart valve and the synergraft model vascular graft in the emea region 
marketing efforts for the cryolife o brien aortic heart valve are primarily directed toward cardiac surgeons 
marketing efforts for the synergraft model are primarily directed toward vascular surgeons 
european operations the company markets its products in the emea regions through its european subsidiary  cryolife europa ltd  based in guildford  united kingdom 
europa  with its team of approximately eleven employees  provides customer service  logistics  marketing  and clinical support to cardiovascular  vascular  thoracic  and general surgeons throughout the emea regions 
europa markets and distributes the company s complete range of products through its direct sales representatives in england and wales and a network of independent agents and distributors in the emea regions 
backlog the limited supply of tissue that is donated and available for processing typically results in a backlog of orders in the company s human tissue business 
the amount of backlog fluctuates based on the tissues available for shipment and varies based on the surgical needs of specific cases 
the company s backlog is generally not considered firm and must be confirmed with the customer before shipment 
the company currently does not have a backlog of orders related to bioglue  cryolife o brien heart valves  or synergraft bovine vascular grafts 
research and development the company uses its expertise in biochemistry and cell biology  and its understanding of the needs of the cardiovascular  and vascular  surgery medical specialties  to expand its surgical adhesive and preservation businesses in the us and to develop or acquire implantable products and technologies for these specialties 
the company seeks to identify market areas that can benefit from preserved living tissues and other related technologies  to develop innovative techniques and products within these areas  to secure their commercial protection  to establish their efficacy  and then to market these techniques and products 
the company employs approximately people in its research and development department  including seven phds with specialties in the fields of molecular biology  protein chemistry  vascular physiology  and biochemistry 
in order to expand the company s service and product offerings  the company is currently in the process of developing or investigating several technologies and products  including technologies related to human tissue preservation to further enhance its safety  its protein hydrogel technology used in bioglue and other bioglue derivatives  additional applications of its synergraft technology  and its activation control technology act 
biofoam  a derivative of the pht  is in preclinical development 
biofoam contains an expansion agent  which has the potential to rapidly fill and seal internal body cavities  such as aneurysm sacs  and may provide hemostatsis in penetrating wounds and severe trauma 
the   and us congress defense appropriations conference reports included  million  and million  respectively  for the continued development of protein hydrogel technology for use on the battlefield 
the company applied for and was awarded the full  under the bill 
the company applied for funding for biofoam development under the bill in july but has not yet been notified of an award decision 
the company anticipates applying for funding under the bill during cryolife is currently involved in initial animal trials related to this grant 
biodisc  a derivative of the pht  is undergoing clinical evaluation to determine its clinical utility as a nucleus pulposus replacement in spinal disc repair 
the nucleus pulposus is surrounded by fibrous tissue annulus fibrosis and is located in the center of the vertebral disc 
the nucleus pulposus is composed of a gelatinous like material that in conjunction with the annulus fibrosis acts as a cushion or shock absorber to the spinal column 
if the nucleus pulposus herniates through the annulus  it may be removed in a procedure known as a discectomy 
biodisc is designed to fill the area where the nucleus pulposus was removed  and is intended to preserve disc height  reduce lumbar motion segment instability  and reduce recurrent disc herniation 
the ten patient study enrollment has been completed and patient follow up will continue through an interim analysis of data will be used for ce mark submission anticipated in in october the company announced that it has signed a licensing and distribution agreement with bioform for the development and commercialization of bioglue for use in cosmetic and plastic surgery indications 
the agreement calls for bioform to fund the clinical development and regulatory approval process for commercializing bioglue for use in cosmetic and plastic surgery indications in the united states  canada  and various countries in europe 
in addition  bioform will oversee all aspects of the marketing  sales and distribution of bioglue in the united states  canada  and various countries in europe for these indications 
cryolife will remain the exclusive supplier of bioglue for all applications 
under the terms of the agreement  cryolife received an initial fee from bioform  and will receive a milestone payment upon the first fda approval for use in cosmetic and plastic surgery indications 
in february the company formed aurazyme pharmaceuticals  inc aurazyme to foster the commercial development of its act 
the act is a reversible linker technology that might have possible uses in the areas of fibrinolysis blood clot dissolving  and other drug delivery applications 
since management has been seeking to advance the development of drug delivery therapies utilizing the act through grants  research and development partnerships  joint ventures  and equity investments thereby allowing the company to focus its resources on the commercial development of its bioglue  synergraft technology  and other products under development 
to the extent the company identifies additional applications for its products  the company may attempt to license these products to corporate partners for further development of such applications or seek funding from outside sources to continue the commercial development of such technologies 
the company may also attempt to license technologies from third parties to supplement its product lines 
the company s research and development strategy is to allocate available resources among the company s core market areas of preservation services and implantable medical devices  based on the size of the potential market for any specific product candidate and the estimated development time and cost required to bring the product to market 
research on these and other projects is conducted in the company s research and development laboratory or at universities or clinics where the company sponsors research projects 
in   and the company spent approximately million  million  and million respectively  on research and development activities on new and existing products 
these amounts represented approximately   and of the company s revenues for the years   and  respectively 
the company s medical and scientific advisory board consults on various research and development programs 
the company s pre clinical studies are conducted at universities and other locations outside the company s facilities by third parties under contract with the company 
in addition to these efforts the company may pursue other research and development activities

preservation services the company also employs a comprehensive quality assurance program in all of its tissue processing activities 
the company is subject to donor eligibility and good tissue practice regulations  as well as other fda quality system regulations  and iso requirements 
the company s quality assurance program begins with the development and implementation of training policies and procedures for the employees of procurement agencies 
to assure uniformity of procurement practices among the tissue recovery teams  the company provides procurement protocols  transport packages  and tissue transport liquids to the procurement organizations 
the company also periodically audits procurement organizations to ensure and enhance best recovery practices 
upon receipt by the company  each tissue is assigned a unique control number that provides traceability of tissue from procurement through the processing and preservation processes  and ultimately to the tissue recipient 
samples from each tissue donor are subjected to a variety of tests to screen and test for infectious diseases 
samples of some tissues are also provided for pathology testing 
following dissection of the tissue to be cryopreserved  dissected tissue is treated with a proprietary antimicrobial solution and aseptically packaged 
after antimicrobial treatment  each tissue must be shown to be free of detectable microbial contaminants by two independent tests before being considered releasable for distribution 
the materials and solutions used by the company in processing tissue must meet the company s quality standards and be approved by quality assurance personnel for use in processing 
throughout tissue processing  detailed records of the tissues  materials  and processes are maintained and reviewed by quality assurance personnel

the fda periodically audits the company s processing facilities for compliance with those requirements 
see fda order on human tissue preservation and other fda correspondence and notices other fda correspondence and notices above for a discussion of recent inspections 
patents  licenses  and other proprietary rights the company relies on a combination of patents  trademarks  confidentiality agreements and security procedures to protect its proprietary products  processing technology  trade secrets  and know how 
the company believes that its patents  trade secrets  trademarks  and technology licensing rights provide it with important competitive advantages 
the company owns or has licensed rights to us patents and foreign patents  including patents relating to its technology for human cardiovascular and vascular tissue preservation  tissue revitalization prior to freezing  tissue transport  bioglue  act  and packaging 
the company has approximately pending us patent applications and pending foreign applications that relate to areas including the company s cryopreservation  protein hydrogel technologies  and other areas 
there can be no assurance that any patents pending will result in issued patents 
the remaining duration of the company s issued patents ranges from to years 
there can be no assurance that the claims allowed in any of the company s existing or future patents will provide competitive advantages for the company s products  processes  and technologies or will not be successfully challenged or circumvented by competitors 
to the extent that any of the company s products or services are not effectively patent protected  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
under current law  patent applications in the us and patent applications in foreign countries are maintained in secrecy for a period after filing 
the right to a patent in the us is attributable to the first to invent  not the first to file a patent application 
the company cannot be sure that its products or technologies do not infringe patents that may be granted in the future pursuant to pending patent applications or that its products do not infringe any patents or proprietary rights of third parties 
the company may incur substantial legal fees in defending against a patent infringement claim or in asserting claims against third parties 
in the event that any relevant claims of third party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable  the company could be prevented from marketing certain of its products or could be required to obtain licenses from the owners of such patents or be required to redesign its products or services to avoid infringement 
there can be no assurance that such licenses would be available or  if available  would be on terms acceptable to the company or that the company would be successful in any attempt to redesign its products or services to avoid infringement 
the company s failure to obtain these licenses or to redesign its products or services could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company has licensed from third parties certain technologies related to its synergraft and act technologies that call for the payment of royalties based on revenues  when and if such products or services are approved for marketing 
the loss of these licenses could adversely affect the company s ability to successfully develop certain technologies 
the company has entered into confidentiality agreements with its employees and several of its consultants and third party vendors to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information 
there can be no assurance that the obligations of employees of the company and third parties with whom the company has entered into confidentiality agreements will effectively prevent disclosure of the company s confidential information or provide meaningful protection for the company s confidential information if there is unauthorized use or disclosure  or that the company s trade secrets or proprietary information will not be independently developed by the company s competitors 
litigation may be necessary to defend against claims of infringement  to enforce patents and trademarks of the company  or to protect trade secrets and could result in substantial cost to  and diversion of effort by  the company 
there can be no assurance that the company would prevail in any such litigation 
in addition the laws of some foreign countries do not protect the company s proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the us competition implantable biomedical devices for use as surgical adhesives and sealants the company competes with many domestic and foreign medical device and pharmaceutical companies 
in the surgical adhesive and surgical sealant area  the company competes primarily with baxter healthcare s tisseel  floseal  and coseal  ethicon s evicel and surgifoam  and tyco healthcare s us surgical division s duraseal products 
additionally  johnson johnson is under fda review for a surgical adhesive for approval in vascular sealing 
the company currently competes with these products based on the products features  such as strength and ease of use 
competitive products may also be under development by other large medical device  pharmaceutical  and biopharmaceutical companies 
many of the company s current and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technological  research and development  regulatory and clinical  manufacturing  marketing and sales  and personnel resources than the company 
these competitors may also have greater experience in developing products  conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals  and manufacturing and marketing such products 
certain of these competitors may obtain patent protection  approval or clearance by the fda or foreign countries  or product commercialization earlier than the company  any of which could materially adversely affect the company 
furthermore  if the company commences significant commercial sales of its products  it will also be competing with respect to manufacturing efficiency and marketing capabilities 
other recently developed technologies or procedures are  or may in the future be  the basis of competitive products 
there can be no assurance that the company s current competitors or other parties will not succeed in developing alternative technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use  or more economical than those which have been or are being developed by the company or that would render the company s technology and products obsolete and non competitive in these fields 
in such event  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
see part i  item a  risk factors risks relating to our business rapid technological change could cause our services and products to become obsolete 
cryopreserved human tissues and bioprosthetic cardiovascular devices the company currently faces competition from at least three non profit tissue banks that cryopreserve and distribute human cardiac and vascular tissue  as well as from several companies that market mechanical  porcine  and bovine heart valves  and synthetic vascular grafts for implantation 
many established companies  some with resources greater than those of the company  are engaged in manufacturing  marketing  and selling alternatives to cryopreserved human tissue 
management believes that it competes with other entities that cryopreserve human tissue on the basis of technology  customer service  and quality assurance 
following the fda order in  the company experienced a decrease in the procurement and processing of human tissue  a decrease in cardiovascular  vascular  and orthopaedic tissue shipments  and the lack of orthopaedic tissue shipments for a period of time 
the company s competitors have been favorably impacted and the company believes it has lost some market share following the fda order in the interruption in the company s services  and the changes made to the company s preservation services  which have had the effect of substantially increasing tissue processing and release times and reducing the yield of implantable tissue per donor  have had an adverse impact on our profitability 
management believes that the human heart valves cryopreserved by the company  as compared to mechanical  porcine  and bovine heart valves  compete on the factors set forth above  as well as by providing a tissue that is the preferred replacement alternative with respect to certain medical conditions  such as pediatric cardiac reconstruction  valve replacements for women in their child bearing years  and valve replacements for patients with endocarditis 
generally  for each procedure that may utilize vascular human tissue that the company cryopreserves  there are alternative treatments 
often  in the case of veins  these alternatives include the repair  partial removal  or complete removal of the damaged tissue and may utilize other tissues from the patients themselves or synthetic products 
the attending physician  in consultation with the patient  makes the selection of treatment choices 
any newly developed treatments will also compete with the use of tissue cryopreserved by the company 
human and stentless porcine heart valves 
alternatives to human heart valves cryopreserved by the company include mechanical valves  porcine valves  and valves constructed from bovine pericardium 
st 
jude medical  inc is the leading supplier of mechanical heart valves  and has a marketing and distribution arrangement with a non profit tissue bank for supplies of cryopreserved human heart valves 
medtronic  inc is the leading supplier of porcine heart valves 
edwards life sciences  inc is the leading supplier of bovine pericardial heart valves 
in addition management believes that at least three domestic tissue banks offer preservation services for human heart valves in competition with the company 
the company presently distributes its stentless porcine heart valve only outside the us this stentless porcine heart valve competes with mechanical valves  stented and stentless porcine valves  human heart valves  and processed bovine pericardial heart valves 
the company is aware of at least five other companies that offer porcine and bovine pericardial heart valves 
human vascular tissue 
there are a number of providers of synthetic alternatives to veins cryopreserved by the company and those alternatives are available primarily in medium and large diameters 
currently  management believes that there are at least two other non profit tissue banks that cryopreserve and distribute human vascular tissue in competition with the company 
companies offering either synthetic or allograft products may enter this market in the future 
human orthopaedic tissue 
in december cryolife entered into the rti agreement  discussed above  respecting procurement  processing  and distribution activities for cardiovascular and vascular tissue processed and distributed by rti and orthopaedic tissue for the knee processed and distributed by cryolife 
according to the rti agreement  cryolife ceased accepting for processing donated human orthopaedic tissue on january  and will work to transition existing arrangements for recovery of human orthopaedic tissue to rti 
likewise on january   rti ceased accepting donated human cardiovascular and vascular tissues for processing and will work to transition its arrangements for recovery of these tissues to cryolife 
certain physical assets relating to the tissues that are the subject of the agreement will also be transferred between the parties 
no cash was exchanged in the transaction 
cryolife will continue to distribute its existing orthopaedic tissue inventory  and rti will continue to distribute its existing cardiovascular and vascular tissue inventory  through june  after that date  cryolife will become entitled to distribute rti s remaining cardiovascular and vascular tissue inventory  and rti will become entitled to distribute cryolife s remaining orthopaedic tissue inventory  for a fee 
under the rti agreement  from july  through december   except as set forth above  cryolife has agreed not to market or solicit orders for certain human orthopaedic tissues and rti has agreed not to market or solicit orders for human cardiac and vascular tissues 
the company s historic competition in the area of orthopaedic tissue has varied according to the tissue involved 
when transplantation is indicated  the historic principal competition for tendons and meniscus cryopreserved by the company has been either freeze dried or twice frozen human connective tissues 
more than ten tissue banks process these alternative allografts 
government regulation us federal regulation of medical devices because bioglue and certain human heart valves are  and other company products may in the future be  regulated as medical devices  the company and these products are subject to the provisions of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fdca and implementing regulations of the us food and drug administration fda 
pursuant to the fdca  the fda regulates the manufacture  distribution  labeling  and promotion of medical devices in the us also various foreign countries in which the company s products are  or may be  distributed impose additional regulatory requirements 
the fdca provides that  unless exempted by regulation  medical devices may not be distributed in the us unless they have been approved or cleared for marketing by the fda 
there are two review procedures by which medical devices can receive such approval or clearance 
some products may qualify for clearance to be marketed under a section k k procedure  in which the manufacturer provides a premarket notification that it intends to begin marketing the product  and shows that the product is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed k product ie  that it has the same intended use  it is as safe and effective as a legally marketed k device  and it does not raise different questions of safety and effectiveness than does a legally marketed device 
in some cases  the submission must include data from clinical studies 
marketing may commence when the fda issues a clearance letter finding such substantial equivalence 
if the product does not qualify for the k procedure either because it is not substantially equivalent to a legally marketed k device or because it is a class iii device required by the fdca and implementing regulations to have an approved application for premarket approval pma  the fda must approve a pma application before marketing can begin 
pma applications must demonstrate  among other matters  that the medical device is safe and effective 
a pma application is typically a complex submission  usually including the results of human clinical studies  and preparing an application is a detailed and time consuming process 
once a pma application has been submitted  the fda s review may be lengthy and may include requests for additional data 
the fdca also provides for an investigational device exemption ide which authorizes distribution for clinical evaluation of devices that lack a pma or k clearance 
devices subject to an ide are subject to various restrictions imposed by the fda 
the number of patients that may be treated with the device is limited  as is the number of institutions at which the device may be used 
patients must give informed consent to be treated with an investigational device  and review by an institutional review board is needed 
the device must be labeled that it is for investigational use and may not be advertised or otherwise promoted  and the price charged for the device may be limited 
unexpected adverse experiences must be reported to the fda 
under certain circumstances  the fda may grant a humanitarian device exemption hde 
the fda grants hde s in an attempt to encourage the development of medical devices for use in the treatment of rare conditions that affect small patient populations 
an approval by the fda exempts such devices from full compliance with clinical study requirements for pma 
the fdca requires all medical device manufacturers and distributors to register with the fda annually and to provide the fda with a list of those medical devices that they distribute commercially 
the fdca also requires manufacturers of medical devices to comply with labeling requirements and to manufacture devices in accordance with quality system regulations  which require that companies manufacture their products and maintain their documents in a prescribed manner with respect to good manufacturing practices  design  document production  process  labeling and packaging controls  process validation  and other quality control activities 
the fda s medical device reporting regulation requires that a device manufacturer provide information to the fda on death or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its products  as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
the fda further requires that certain medical devices that may not be sold in the us follow certain procedures before they are exported 
the fda inspects medical device manufacturers and distributors and has authority to seize noncomplying medical devices  to enjoin and or to impose civil penalties on manufacturers and distributors marketing non complying medical devices  to criminally prosecute violators  and to order recalls in certain instances 
human heart valves 
the company s human heart valves became subject to regulation by the fda in june  when the fda published a notice stating that human heart valves were class iii medical devices under the fdca 
the june notice provided that distribution of human heart valves for transplantation would violate the fdca unless they were the subject of an approved pma or ide on or before august  on october  the fda announced in the federal register that neither an approved application for pma nor an ide is required for processors and distributors who had marketed heart valve allografts before june  this action by the fda resulted in the allograft heart valves being classified as class ii medical devices and has removed them from clinical trial status 
it also allowed the company to distribute such valves to cardiovascular surgeons throughout the us on may   with the promulgation of the final rule for cgtps  the fda reclassified human heart valves  processed on or after may   as human tissue subject to that rule 
as discussed in fda order on human tissue preservation and other fda correspondence and notices  the company has filed a k premarket notification with the fda for the cryovalve sg and has received three letters from the fda requesting that additional information be provided to support the k submission 
cryolife has responded to some of the requests  anticipates responding to some of the additional requests  and has initiated an appeal of others through administrative procedures 
porcine heart valves 
porcine heart valves are class iii medical devices  and fda approval of a pma is required prior to commercial distribution of such valves in the us the porcine heart valves currently marketed by the company have not been approved by the fda for commercial distribution in the us but may be manufactured in the us and exported to foreign countries if the valves meet the specifications of the foreign purchaser  and do not conflict with the laws of and are approved by the country to which they will be exported 
bioglue 
the fda regulates bioglue as a class iii medical device 
in december the company received fda approval for bioglue as an adjunct to sutures and staples for use in adult patients in open surgical repair of large vessels 
prior to this approval  the company received an hde in december for bioglue for use as an adjunct in repair of acute thoracic aortic dissections 
the product is health canada  australia  and ce mark approved for additional soft tissue repair 
us federal regulation of human tissue the company s non valved conduits  vascular grafts  and orthopaedic tissues are not currently subject to regulation under the fdca as medical devices 
see fda order on human tissue preservation and other fda correspondence and notices other fda correspondence and notices regarding correspondence from the fda about cardiovascular and vascular tissues processed with the synergraft technology 
however  the fda does regulate these products pursuant to section of the public health services act  which in turn provides the regulatory framework for regulation of human cellular and tissue products cfr parts and 
historically  heart valves were one of a small number of processed human tissues over which the fda asserted medical device jurisdiction 
concerns with the transmission of hiv and hepatitis b led the fda to issue an interim rule in december as an emergency measure to protect the public from any human tissue that had incomplete or no documentation ascertaining its freedom from communicable diseases 
the fda modified the regulation and reissued it as a new rule  effective january  which focused on donor screening and testing to prevent the introduction  transmission  and spread of hiv and and hepatitis b and c 
the final rule set minimal requirements to prevent the transmission of communicable diseases from human tissue used for transplantation 
the rule defines human tissue as any tissue derived from a human body which is i intended for administration to another human for the diagnosis  cure  mitigation  treatment  or prevention of any condition or disease and ii recovered  processed  stored  or distributed by methods not intended to change tissue function or characteristics 
the fda definition excludes  among other things  tissue that currently is regulated as a human drug  biological product  or medical device and excludes kidney  liver  heart  lung  pancreas  or any other vascularized human organ 
the current regulations applicable to human tissues include requirements for donor suitability discussed above  processing standards  establishment registration  and product listing 
on january  the fda published a final rule that requires human cells  tissue  and cellular and tissue based products establishments to register with the agency and list their human cells  tissues  and cellular and tissue based products hct ps 
the final rule  cfr parts  became effective on april  for human tissues intended for transplantation that are regulated under section of the phs act and part it became effective for all other hct ps when the remaining parts of cfr part were finalized 
in may the fda published a new final rule governing the eligibility of donors of human cell and tissue products 
this rule expands previous requirements for testing and screening for risks of communicable diseases that could be spread by the use of these tissues 
in november the fda published a new final rule governing the procedures and processes related to the manufacture of human cell and tissue products under the cgtps 
both the new donor eligibility rule and the cgtp rule became effective on may  and designate human heart valves  processed on or after may   as human tissue rather than medical devices 
it is likely that the fda s regulation of processed human tissue will continue to evolve in the future 
complying with fda regulatory requirements or obtaining required fda approvals or clearances may entail significant time delays and expenses or may not be possible  any of which may have a material adverse effect on the company 
as discussed in fda order on human tissue preservation and other fda correspondence and notices  the company filed an administrative appeal on an rfd submitted in october regarding synergraft processed cardiovascular tissue  including the cryovein sg 
on october  cryolife was informed that the fda had denied the appeal and that cryolife will be unable to distribute cryovein tissues with the synergraft technology until further submissions and fda approvals are granted 
the company is evaluating whether it will file and seek fda approvals for cryovein sg or discontinue the cryovein sg 
possible other fda regulation other products and processes under development by the company are likely to be subject to regulation by the fda 
some may be classified as medical devices or human cells and tissue products  while others may be classified as drugs or biological products or subject to a regulatory scheme that the fda may adopt in the future 
regulation of drugs and biological products is substantially similar to regulation of class iii medical devices 
obtaining fda approval to market these products is likely to be a time consuming and expensive process  and there can be no assurance that any of these products will ever receive fda approval  if required  to be marketed 
nota regulation the company s activities in processing and transporting human hearts and certain other organs are also subject to federal regulation under the national organ transplant act nota  which makes it unlawful for any person to knowingly acquire  receive  or otherwise transfer any human organ for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation if the transfer affects interstate commerce 
nota excludes from the definition of valuable consideration reasonable payments associated with the removal  transportation  implantation  processing  preservation  quality control  and storage of a human organ 
the purpose of this statutory provision is to allow for compensation for legitimate services 
the company believes that to the extent its activities are subject to nota  it meets this statutory provision relating to the reasonableness of its charges 
there can be no assurance  however  that restrictive interpretations of nota will not be adopted in the future that would call into question one or more aspects of the company s methods of charging for its preservation services 
state licensing requirements some states have enacted statutes and regulations governing the processing  transportation  and storage of human organs and tissue 
the activities engaged in by the company require it to be licensed as a clinical laboratory and tissue bank under georgia  new york  california  maryland  and florida law 
the company has such licenses  and the company believes it is in compliance with applicable state laws and regulations relating to clinical laboratories and tissue banks that store  process  and distribute human tissue designed to be used for medical purposes in human beings 
there can be no assurance  however  that more restrictive state laws or regulations will not be adopted in the future that could adversely affect the company s operations 
certain employees of the company have obtained other required state licenses 
foreign approval requirements sales of medical devices and biological products outside the us are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
approval of a product by comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to commercial distribution of the product in those countries 
the time required to obtain foreign approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
the eea recognizes a single medical device approval  called a ce mark  which allows for distribution of an approved product throughout the eea member state countries european union eu countries  and european free trade association efta countries without additional general applications in each country 
however  individual eea members reserve the right to require additional labeling or information to address particular patient safety issues prior to allowing marketing 
third parties called notified bodies award the ce mark 
these notified bodies are approved and subject to review by the competent authorities of their respective countries 
a number of countries outside of the eea accept the ce mark in lieu of marketing submissions as an addendum to that country s application process 
the company has been issued ce marks for its cryolife o brien aortic heart valve  bioglue  and synergraft model vascular grafts 
the company s porcine heart valves and synergraft model vascular graft may be exported to more than countries outside the us environmental matters the company s tissue processing activities generate some biomedical wastes consisting primarily of human and animal pathological and biological wastes  including human and animal tissue and body fluids removed during laboratory procedures 
the biomedical wastes generated by the company are placed in appropriately constructed and labeled containers and are segregated from other wastes generated by the company 
the company contracts with third parties for transport  treatment  and disposal of biomedical waste 
although the company believes it is in compliance with applicable laws and regulations promulgated by the us environmental protection agency and the georgia department of natural resources  environmental protection division  the failure by the company to comply fully with any such regulations could result in an imposition of penalties  fines  or sanctions  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
employees as of december  the company had approximately employees 
these employees included seven persons with phd degrees  one with an md degree  and one with a md degree 
none of the company s employees are represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining agreement  and the company has never experienced a work stoppage or interruption due to labor disputes 
management believes its relations with its employees are good 
available information it is the company s policy to make all of its filings with the sec  including without limitation its annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  and all amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to section a or d of the securities exchange act of the exchange act  available free of charge on the company s website  www

item a 
risk factors 
risks relating to our business overview we have faced extraordinary challenges since we received  on august   an fda order calling for the retention  recall  and or destruction of all non valved cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissue processed by us since october  the fda order resulted in the destruction of much of our tissue  required that we adjust revenue for tissue recall returns  curtailed our processing activities  and subjected us to intense fda scrutiny and additional regulatory requirements that increased costs 
we also suffered decreased revenues due to lack of processing ability  and decreased market demand for our services 
during the same year we were the subject of intense adverse media attention in connection with allegations that tissue that we processed had infected a man in minnesota and caused his death 
we were also the subject of shareholders class action and derivative shareholder suits  which were not resolved until the last half of product liability cases and claims increased to unprecedented numbers for us  using all of our related insurance policy year insurance coverage and taxing our other resources 
the sec has initiated a formal investigation which  to our knowledge  is ongoing 
these challenges have affected our revenues  increased our costs to process tissues and our operating expenses  and strained management resources 
although we resumed processing and distribution of the types of tissues subject to the fda order and resolved many of the product liability suits pending against us  the foregoing factors will continue to challenge us to some degree in our operations 
we have experienced operating losses and negative cash flows  and we must continue to address the underlying causes in order to operate profitably and generate positive cash flows 
due principally to factors mentioned above  we have suffered net losses in the years ended december  through and generated negative operating cash flow each year in the five year period ended december  our long term earnings  liquidity  and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including the success of bioglue and other products using related technology  our ability to increase the level of tissue procurement and demand for our tissue preservation services  our ability to maintain sufficient margins on our tissue preservation services  our spending levels on research and development activities  including research studies  to develop and support our service and product pipeline  the timing and cost of resolving our remaining outstanding product liability lawsuits and other claims  whether we will be able to successfully transition to us the cardiovascular and vascular tissue procurement that was previously received by rti  to a lesser degree  our success at resolving issues with the fda regarding processing of human tissue using the synergraft technology  and our success in implementing recently identified strategic initiatives 
if we are unable to address the causes of our operating losses and negative cash flows  we will need to raise additional capital which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
if we are unable to address the issues facing us  and continue to experience negative cash flows  we anticipate that we will require additional financing or need to seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings  or other sources of capital to meet liquidity and capital requirements 
we may not be able to obtain additional funds when needed or on acceptable terms  which could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance and operate our business 
if we issue equity capital  this may dilute the holdings of existing shareholders 
key growth strategies identified as a result of our strategic review may not generate the anticipated benefits 
in january we engaged piper jaffray co 
to assist our management and board of directors in identifying and evaluating potential strategies to enhance shareholder value 
as a result of this review  the board of directors has directed management to actively pursue three key strategies to generate revenue and earnings growth in addition to continuing to focus on growing our business and leveraging our strengths and expertise in our core marketplaces 
these three strategies are identifying and evaluating acquisition opportunities of complementary product lines and companies  licensing our technology to third parties for non competing uses  and analyzing and identifying underperforming assets for us to consider selling or otherwise disposing of 
although management has begun to implement these strategies  we cannot be certain that they will ultimately enhance shareholder value 
the rti agreement may not generate the anticipated benefits 
as part of our strategic plan  we entered into the rti agreement under which we agreed to cease processing orthopaedic tissues starting january  in exchange for  among other things  a non compete agreement from rti with respect to cardiovascular tissues and the potential for us to receive additional cardiovascular and vascular procurement which was previously being received by rti 
we may not receive the additional cardiovascular and vascular procurement that we anticipate to receive 
additionally  we may be unable to increase our cardiovascular and vascular revenues sufficiently to compensate for the loss of the orthopaedic revenues resulting from the rti agreement 
we may be unable to comply with the covenants of our credit facility  which would limit our borrowing capacity and potentially result in a default under the credit facility  and our credit facility limits our ability to issue additional debt or pay cash dividends 
our credit agreement places limitations on the amount that we may borrow  and includes various affirmative and negative covenants 
in particular  we are uncertain whether we can comply with the adjusted earnings test 
in the event that we do not reach the necessary level of quarterly adjusted earnings  and were required to spend our qualifying cash and cash equivalents  we anticipate that our borrowing capacity would be limited to million 
further  if we fail to meet this and other covenants under the facility  we may be in breach of the credit agreement  our outstanding borrowings may be accelerated  and we may lose our borrowing capacity under the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also includes conditions on incurring new indebtedness and limitations on cash dividends 
these restrictions and conditions could make it more difficult or more expensive for us to borrow money 
there are limitations on our net operating loss carryforwards 
we estimate that at december   we had approximately million in us federal net operating loss carryforwards to offset future taxable income 
these carryforwards begin to expire in the tax year 
the availability of these net operating loss carryforwards is limited after an ownership change within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
accordingly  a change in control of our company could substantially reduce the benefit of our operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  we may be unable to generate enough profits  if any  prior to the expiration of the operating loss carryforwards  to utilize our carryforwards 
we are significantly dependent on our revenues from bioglue and are subject to a variety of risks affecting this product 
bioglue has become a significant source of our revenues 
should the product be the subject of adverse developments with regard to its safety  efficacy  or reimbursement practices  or if a competitor s product obtains greater acceptance  or our rights to manufacture and market this product are challenged  the result could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
also  we have only two suppliers of bovine serum albumen  which is necessary for the manufacture of bioglue 
furthermore  we presently have only one supplier for our new syringe 
if we lose one or more of these suppliers  our ability to manufacture and sell bioglue could be adversely impacted 
we cannot be sure that we would be able to replace any such loss on a timely basis  if at all 
we continue to feel the adverse impacts of the fda order and subsequent fda activity 
the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and resulting adverse publicity materially and adversely affected our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
as a result  our revenues decreased  and we have incurred losses and negative cash flows 
in addition  as a result of the fda order  subsequent fda activity  and changes in our processing  the costs of such processing have increased and are likely to remain high as compared to cost levels prior to the fda order 
these high costs have had a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  cash flows  and financial position and may continue to do so for some time 
the success of our tissue preservation services depends upon  among other factors  the availability of sufficient quantities of tissue from human donors 
if the supply of donated human tissue is materially reduced  this would restrict our growth and adversely affect our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we rely primarily upon the efforts of third party procurement agencies  tissue banks most of which are not for profit  and others to educate the public and foster a willingness to donate tissue 
because of the adverse publicity associated with the fda order and subsequent fda activity and uncertainty regarding future tissue processing  some procurement agencies stopped sending tissue to us for processing 
as a result  our processing has been constrained in part due to lower availability of tissue 
if we are unable to obtain tissues from procurement agencies that have ceased sending tissue to us for processing  to develop new sources  or to increase the tissues shipped from our current suppliers  we may be unable to obtain adequate supplies of donated tissues to operate profitably 
physicians have been and may continue to be reluctant to implant our preserved tissues or use our other products 
some physicians or implanting institutions have been reluctant to choose our preserved tissues for use in implantation  due to a perception that they may not be safe or to a belief that the implanting physician or hospital may be subject to a heightened liability risk if our tissues are used 
in addition  for similar reasons  some hospital risk managers have not allowed implanting surgeons to utilize our tissues when alternatives are available 
several risk managers and physicians have refused to use our products due to these concerns 
these conditions have materially and adversely affected demand for our processed human tissues 
if these conditions persist  our results of operations and cash flows will continue to be adversely affected 
if additional implanting hospitals or physicians representing significant revenues refuse to use tissues that we preserve or our other products  including bioglue  and we are unable to replace the revenues lost  our revenues and profits would be materially and adversely affected 
our products and the tissues we process allegedly have caused and may in the future cause injury to patients  and we have been and may be exposed to product liability claims and additional regulatory scrutiny as a result 
the processing  preservation and distribution of human allograft tissue  bovine tissue products  porcine tissue products and the manufacture and sale of medical devices entail inherent risks of medical complications for patients and have resulted and may result in product liability claims against us 
plaintiffs have asserted that our tissue or medical devices have caused a variety of injuries  including death 
when patients are injured  die or have other adverse results following procedures using our tissue or medical devices  we have been and may be sued and our insurance coverage has been and may be inadequate 
adverse judgments and settlements in excess of our available insurance coverage could materially and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
as a result of medical complications that are alleged to have been caused by or occur in connection with medical procedures involving our tissue or medical devices  we have been and may be subject to additional fda and other regulatory scrutiny and inspections 
for example  shortly after the fda order  the fda posted a notice  now archived  on its website stating its concerns regarding our heart valve preservation services 
as a result  some surgeons and hospitals decided not to use our heart valves 
cautionary statements from the fda or other regulators regarding our tissue services or products  or negative reviews from the fda or regulators of our processing and manufacturing facilities have decreased and may in the future decrease demand for our tissue services or products and could reduce our revenues and materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial position 
in addition to the recall resulting from the fda order  we have in the past suspended and in the future may have to suspend the distribution of particular types of tissues as a result of reported adverse events in connection with our tissues 
for example  during september  in response to a reported infection  we halted the shipment of boned orthopaedic tissues in order to conduct an additional review of the systems in place to process and release boned orthopaedic tissues 
suspension of the distribution of  or recall of  our tissue services or medical products could materially and adversely affect our revenues and profits 
we may be unable to address the concerns raised by the fda in its form notices of observations 
the fda issued form notices of observations in february and october  in february  and in august among the issues raised in the most recent were the process validations associated with the cryovalve sg  complaint handling and reporting  and root cause analysis of certain microbial testing results 
if the fda deems our responses to the most recent  or any future notices  unsatisfactory  it could take further action  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
the fda could institute additional recalls of products  require us to perform additional tests  begin to require prescriptions for products where they are not currently required  halt the shipping or processing of products  or require additional approvals for marketing our products or services 
the fda has notified us of its belief that marketing of cryovalve sg and cryovein sg require additional regulatory submissions and or approvals 
during the fda notified us that it considers the application of the synergraft technology to allograft heart valves cryovalve sg to be a major manufacturing change and required us to submit a k 
we submitted a k for cryovalve sg and have received three requests for additional information from the fda 
while we have provided most of the requested information  we are still compiling additional information  including bench testing and clinical data 
we are also seeking to resolve certain other requests through administrative procedures at the fda 
it could be time consuming and expensive to resolve this matter  depending in large part on the success of our efforts through the fda s administrative processes 
we can give no assurance that the fda will agree with us or that it will clear the cryovalve sg k in the foreseeable future  if at all 
if we are unable to resolve this issue  we may not be able to offer our synergraft process for human heart valves 
the fda has also determined that non valved cardiovascular cryovein sg tissues processed using our synergraft technology should be regulated as medical devices and that it will require additional approvals for continued distribution of these tissues 
our appeal of this designation was denied 
we cannot be certain that the designation of synergraft cardiovascular tissue will be resolved favorably 
if we are unable to resolve this matter  we may not be able to offer our synergraft process for non valved cardiac tissues 
regulatory action outside of the us has affected our business in the past and may also affect our business in the future 
after the fda issued the fda order  discussed above  health canada also issued a recall on the same types of tissue 
in addition  other countries have made inquiries regarding the tissues that we export  although these inquiries are now  to our knowledge  complete 
in the event other countries raise additional regulatory concerns  we may be unable to export tissues to those countries 
revenue from international human tissue preservation services was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also offer bioglue and other products for use in other countries 
our violation of government regulations could result in loss of revenues and customers as well as additional compliance expense 
the fda and some states regulate the facilities and processes that we use 
our facilities are also subject to periodic inspection by the fda and state regulatory authorities to ensure our compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
if we fail to comply with these laws and regulations  we can be subject to sanctions  such as written observations of deficiencies made following inspections  warning letters  product recalls  fines  product seizures and consent decrees  all of which would be made available to the public 
such actions and publicity could affect our ability to sell our products and services 
in the past  the fda has sent us notifications and warning letters relating to deficiencies in our compliance with fda requirements 
we were required to take measures to respond 
we also were subject to the fda order  which decreased our revenues  increased our processing costs  and materially and adversely affected our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
we cannot be certain that the fda or state regulatory authorities will not request that we take additional steps to correct deficiencies that may be raised in the future 
correcting any such deficiencies could materially and adversely affect our business 
we are the subject of an sec investigation 
the sec notified us in july that its informal inquiry became a formal investigation in june we have cooperated with this investigation both before and after issuance of the formal order of investigation in june  and intend to continue doing so 
we voluntarily reported the names of six employees and former employees to the sec in december after discovering they had apparently sold cryolife shares on august  before trading was halted pending our press release reporting the fda order 
these individuals were not then and are not currently executive officers of our company 
the formal order of investigation indicates that the sec s scope includes whether  during  among other things  we or others may have traded while in possession of material nonpublic information  made or caused to be made false or misleading statements or omissions in press releases and sec filings  and failed to maintain accurate records and adequate controls 
the investigation could also encompass matters not specifically identified in the formal order 
on september   the sec announced that it had commenced proceedings in federal district court against certain of the above referenced former and current employees and certain of their spouses for alleged illegal insider trading arising out of their august  trading activities 
those proceedings resulted in settlements with the sec 
as of the date hereof  the sec has had no discussions with our representatives as to whether the sec will seek relief against us  or the nature of any relief that it may seek 
at present  we are unable to predict the ultimate focus or outcome of the investigation  what the current status of the investigation may be  or when the sec will complete it 
an unfavorable outcome could result in monetary or other penalties and could materially and adversely affect our reputation  business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
our existing insurance policies may not be sufficient to cover our actual claims liability 
our products and the tissues we process allegedly have caused and may in the future cause injury to patients using our products or tissues and we have been and may be exposed to product liability claims 
following the fda order  product liability lawsuits increased to unprecedented numbers for us 
these claims involved assertions that infections and related morbidity  including death  were the result of inadequacies in our procedures 
we maintain claims made insurance policies to mitigate our financial exposure to product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
as of february   we were aware of three pending product liability lawsuits against us 
two of these lawsuits are not covered by insurance because the claimed loss date was prior to the effective coverage date for the insurance policy 
additional uninsured claims may be filed in the future 
other product liability claims have been asserted against us that have not resulted in lawsuits 
we are monitoring these claims 
our december  consolidated balance sheet reflects a liability in the amount of approximately  for the estimated cost of resolving these claims 
the amounts recorded were estimates  and do not reflect actual settlement arrangements or final judgments  the latter of which could include punitive damages  nor do they represent cash set aside for the purpose of making payments 
this balance sheet also reflects a million liability included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million and other long term liabilities of million for the estimated cost of resolving unreported product liability claims 
our product liability insurance policies do not include coverage for any punitive damages 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies product liability claims for a description of our accounting treatment for product liability claims 
several putative class action lawsuits were filed in july through september against us and certain of our officers  alleging violations of sections b and a of the securities exchange act of  based on a series of purportedly materially false and misleading statements to the market 
on july  we reached an agreement in principle to settle the securities class action lawsuit and the settlement became final later in the year 
in august and january purported shareholder derivative actions were filed 
these lawsuits  which named us as a nominal defendant  alleged that the individual defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the company by causing or allowing the company to engage in certain inappropriate practices that caused the company to suffer damages 
a settlement was also reached in those cases and became final in our insurance proceeds were insufficient to fund the costs of defending and settling the securities class action and derivative lawsuits 
in september we settled insurance coverage disputes with former insurance carriers for million  net of associated legal fees 
the disputes involved losses stemming from approximately million that we paid in in settlement of outstanding claims 
no party admitted any liability as part of the september settlement 
the million is included as a component of general  administrative  and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations as of december  we received the net proceeds of million in october if we are unsuccessful in arranging acceptable settlements of product liability  securities class action  or derivative claims  we may not have sufficient insurance coverage and liquid assets to meet these obligations 
additionally  if one or more claims in which we are a defendant  whether now pending or hereafter arising  should be tried with a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff s  such verdict s could exceed our available insurance coverage and liquid assets 
if we are unable to meet required future cash payments to resolve the outstanding or any future claims  this will materially and adversely affect our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
further  if the costs of pending or unreported but incurred product liability claims exceed our current estimates  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
if we do not have sufficient resources to pay the claims against us  we may be forced to cease operations or seek protection under applicable bankruptcy laws 
we may be unable to obtain adequate insurance at a reasonable cost  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain satisfactory insurance coverage in the future  we may be subject to additional future exposure from product liability claims 
additionally  insurance rates may be significantly higher than in the past  and insurers may provide less coverage  which may adversely impact our profitability 
unlike the prior year s policy  the products liability policy did not cover any claims which arose prior to the insurance policy year 
the products liability policy was a two year claims made policy  covering claims arising since the commencement of the policy year 
the products liability policy was a three year claims made policy  covering claims arising since the commencement of the policy year 
our current products liability insurance policy is a four year claims made policy covering claims since the commencement of the policy year and expires in march we are currently evaluating with prospective insurers the available coverage and cost for products liability insurance 
it is possible that there could be increases in both cost and retention  although we expect the coverage to be a five year claims made policy 
we are also currently evaluating with prospective insurers available coverage and cost for director s and officer s insurance policies which expire in april we cannot be certain that we will be successful in obtaining satisfactory coverage once our current coverage expires  which could adversely impact our liquidity if we suffer material uninsured claims liability 
intense competition may affect our ability to operate profitably 
we face competition from other companies that process human tissue  as well as companies that market mechanical valves and synthetic and animal tissue for implantation  and companies that market surgical adhesives and surgical sealants 
management believes that at least three domestic tissue banks offer preservation services for allograft heart valves and many companies offer processed porcine heart valves and mechanical heart valves 
a few companies dominate portions of the mechanical  porcine and bovine heart valve markets  including st 
jude medical  inc  medtronic  inc  and edwards life sciences 
our bioglue product competes with other surgical adhesives and surgical sealants  including baxter healthcare s tisseel  floseal  and coseal  ethicon s evicel and surgifoam  and tyco healthcare s us surgical division s duraseal products 
we are also aware that a few companies have surgical adhesive products under development 
for example  closure medical is in clinical trials for a surgical adhesive for approval in vascular sealing that could compete with bioglue in certain applications 
other large medical device  pharmaceutical  and biopharmaceutical companies may also be developing competitive products 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  manufacturing  and marketing resources than we do and are well established in their markets 
we have increased fees and prices on a number of our services and products since january  this increase may provide an opportunity for our competitors to gain market share 
if we are unable to increase prices as planned and retain or improve our market share  our revenue and return to profitability may be adversely affected 
our cryopreserved tissues compete with other entities that cryopreserve human tissue on the basis of technology  customer service  and quality assurance 
our competitors have been favorably impacted and we believe we have lost some market share because our procurement and processing yields of human tissue and our cardiovascular and vascular tissue shipments decreased following the fda order in we believe that the human heart valves cryopreserved by us  as compared to mechanical  porcine  and bovine heart valves  compete on the factors set forth above 
we also believe that our cryopreserved human heart valves compete by providing a tissue that is the preferred replacement alternative with respect to certain medical conditions  including pediatric cardiac reconstruction  valve replacements for women in their child bearing years  and valve replacements for patients with endocarditis 
our bioglue product competes on the basis of its high tensile strength and ease of use 
we cannot give assurance that our products and services will be able to compete successfully 
any products that we develop that gain regulatory clearance or approval will have to compete for market acceptance and market share 
if we fail to compete effectively  this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
the fda order  related adverse publicity  and subsequent fda activity have adversely affected our competitive position and may continue to do so in the future 
our competitors may gain competitive advantages that may be difficult to overcome 
we may not be successful in obtaining necessary clinical results and regulatory approvals for products and services in development  and our new products and services may not achieve market acceptance 
our growth and profitability will depend  in part  upon our ability to complete development of and successfully introduce new products and services  including new applications of our bioglue and related technology and applications applying our synergraft technology 
we are uncertain whether we can develop new products and services to a commercially acceptable form 
we must also expend much time and money to obtain the required regulatory approvals 
for example  if we are unable to resolve the issues we are addressing with the fda with regard to tissues processed using synergraft  we may incur significant costs over a lengthy period of time to meet the fda s requirements 
we may not be able to meet the fda s requirements  and we may not be able to offer a commercially successful product 
although we have conducted pre clinical studies on certain products under development which indicate that such products may be effective in a particular application  we cannot be certain that the results we obtain from expanded clinical studies will be consistent with earlier trial results or be sufficient for us to obtain any required regulatory approvals or clearances 
we cannot give assurance that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent us from successfully developing  introducing and marketing new products 
we also cannot give assurance that the regulatory agencies will clear or approve these or any new products on a timely basis  if ever  or that the new products will adequately meet the requirements of the applicable market or achieve market acceptance 
our ability to complete the development of any of our products is subject to all of the risks associated with the commercialization of new products based on innovative technologies 
such risks include unanticipated technical or other problems  manufacturing difficulties  and the possibility that we have allocated insufficient funds to complete such development 
consequently  we may not be able to successfully develop or manufacture our products which are under development 
if we do develop or manufacture these products  we may not do so on a timely basis 
these products may not meet price or performance objectives  and may not prove to be as effective as competing products 
if we are unable to successfully complete the development of a product  application or service  or if we determine  for financial  technical or other reasons  not to complete development or obtain regulatory approval of any product  application or service  particularly in instances when we have expended significant capital  this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
research and development efforts are time consuming and expensive and we cannot be sure that these efforts will lead to commercially successful products or services 
even the successful commercialization of a new service or product in the medical industry can be characterized by slow growth and high costs associated with marketing  under utilized production capacity  and continuing research and development and education costs 
the introduction of new products or services  which could include new products based on our protein hydrogel technology such as biofoam  biolastic and biodisc  may require significant physician training and years of clinical evidence derived from follow up studies on human implant recipients in order to gain acceptance in the medical community 
investments in new technologies or distribution rights may not be successful 
we may invest in new technology licenses or distribution rights that may not succeed in the marketplace 
in such cases  we may be unable to recover our initial investment  which could include acquiring license or distribution rights or purchasing initial inventory 
inability to recover our initial investment may adversely impact our profitability 
we may be unable to fund our act technology 
the act is a reversible linker technology that has potential uses in the areas of fibrinolysis blood clot dissolving and other drug delivery applications 
in february we formed aurazyme  a wholly owned subsidiary  in order to seek a corporate collaboration or to complete a potential private placement of equity or equity oriented securities to fund the commercial development of the act 
we have been seeking such funding since to allow us to continue developing this technology without incurring additional research and development expenditures  other than through aurazyme 
we cannot guarantee that we can obtain such funding on acceptable terms  if at all 
even if we can obtain such financing  we cannot guarantee that the act will in fact prove to be effective in the above applications 
in addition  any new financing may dilute the ownership interests of our current shareholders  or may include restrictive covenants that could adversely affect us or our business 
synergraft processed tissues may not demonstrate expected benefits 
we process bovine tissues with the synergraft technology and market these services outside the us the process involves antigen reduction  which is the depopulation of the cells of the tissue to be implanted  leaving a matrix of protein fibers that has the potential to be repopulated with the recipient s cells 
if successful  we believe that such repopulation may increase graft longevity and improve the biocompatibility and functionality of such tissue  resulting in the implanted tissue behaving more like the recipient s own tissue 
studies on animals have shown that explanted synergraft processed heart valves will repopulate with the recipient s cells 
however  should such tissues implanted in humans not consistently and adequately repopulate with the human host cells  the higher priced synergraft processed tissues may not demonstrate benefits over other alternatives 
if this happens  it could materially and adversely affect our future expansion plans and could limit our future growth 
if we are not successful in expanding our business activities in international markets  we will not be able to pursue one of our strategies for increasing our revenues 
our international operations are subject to a number of risks which may vary from the risks we face in the us  including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements and tariffs  difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations  including foreign distributor relationships  longer accounts receivable collection cycles in certain foreign countries  adverse economic or political changes  more limited protection for intellectual property in some countries  changes in our international distribution network and direct sales force  changes in currency exchange rates  potential trade restrictions  exchange controls and import and export licensing requirements  and potentially adverse tax consequences of overlapping tax structures 
we are dependent on our key personnel 
our business and future operating results depend in significant part upon the continued contributions of our key technical personnel and senior management  many of who would be difficult to replace 
our business and future operating results also depend in significant part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  processing  technical  marketing  sales  and support personnel for our operations 
competition for such personnel is intense and we cannot promise that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel 
our key employees include our management team  consisting of steven g 
anderson  president  chief executive officer  and chairman  d 
ashley lee  cpa  executive vice president  chief operating officer  and chief financial officer  albert e 
heacox  phd  senior vice president  research and development  gerald b 
seery  senior vice president sales and marketing  and david m 
fronk  vice president  regulatory affairs and quality assurance 
we do not have key life insurance on these individuals 
if we lose any key employees  if any of our key employees fail to perform adequately  or if we are unable to attract and retain skilled employees as needed  this could materially and adversely affect our ability to efficiently operate our business 
extensive government regulation may adversely affect our ability to develop and sell products and services 
government regulation in the us  the eea  and other jurisdictions can determine the success of our and our competitors efforts to market and develop services and products 
the fda  pursuant to rules it promulgated under the public health services act  currently regulates allograft tissues as human tissue 
these rules establish requirements for donor testing and screening of human tissue and record keeping relating to these activities and impose certain registration and product listing requirements on establishments that process or distribute human tissue or cellular based products 
the fda has finalized and implemented good tissue practice regulations akin to good manufacturing practices  which must be followed by tissue banks and processors of human tissue 
these good tissue practice regulations will increase regulatory oversight of cryolife and other processors of human tissue 
although we and our competitors are endeavoring to satisfy the new regulations when they go into effect  there can be no assurance of success 
bioglue is regulated as a class iii medical device  and we believe that our act may be regulated as a biologic or drug by the fda 
the act has not been approved for commercial distribution in the us or elsewhere 
fixed porcine heart valve products are classified as class iii medical devices 
we may not obtain the fda approval required to distribute our porcine heart valve products in the us whether we are able to distribute these products within the eea will depend on whether we can maintain the ce mark for these products and their iso certifications  of which we cannot be certain 
most of our products and services in development and those of our competitors  if successfully developed  will require regulatory approvals from the fda and perhaps other regulatory authorities before they may be commercially distributed 
the process of obtaining required regulatory approvals from the fda normally involves clinical trials as well as an extensive premarket approval application and often takes many years 
the process is expensive and can vary significantly based on the type  complexity  and novelty of the product 
we cannot give any assurance that any products developed by us or our competitors  independently or in collaboration with others  will receive the required approvals for manufacturing and marketing 
delays in obtaining us or foreign approvals could result in substantial additional cost and adversely affect our competitive position 
the fda may also place conditions on product approvals that could restrict commercial applications of our products 
the fda may withdraw product marketing approvals or clearances if we do not maintain compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing 
delays imposed by the governmental clearance process may materially reduce the period during which we have the exclusive right to commercialize patented products 
delays or rejections may also be encountered by us during any stage of the regulatory approval process if clinical or other data fails to satisfactorily demonstrate compliance with  or if the product fails to meet  the regulatory agency s requirements for safety  efficacy and quality 
those requirements may become more stringent due to changes in applicable law  regulatory agency policy  or the adoption of new regulations 
clinical trials may also be delayed due to unanticipated side effects  inability to locate  recruit  and qualify sufficient numbers of patients  lack of funding  the inability to locate or recruit clinical investigators  the redesign of clinical trial programs  the inability to manufacture or acquire sufficient quantities of the particular product or any other components required for clinical trials  changes in development focus  and disclosure of trial results by competitors 
even if we or one of our competitors are able to obtain regulatory approval for any products or services offered  the scope of the approval may significantly limit the indicated usage for which such products or services may be marketed 
the unapproved use of our products or our preserved tissues could adversely affect the reputation of our products or services 
products or services marketed pursuant to fda or foreign oversight or approvals are subject to continuing regulation 
in the us  devices and biologics must be manufactured in registered establishments  and  in the case of biologics  licensed establishments  and must be produced in accordance with quality system regulations 
manufacturing facilities and processes are subject to periodic fda inspection 
labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the fda and  in certain instances  by the federal trade commission 
the export of devices and biologics is also subject to regulation and may require fda approval 
from time to time  the fda may modify such regulations  imposing additional or different requirements 
if we fail to comply with applicable fda requirements  which may be ambiguous  we could face civil and criminal enforcement actions  warnings  citations  product recalls or detentions and other penalties 
this could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
as noted above  the fda order and subsequent fda activity had  and may continue to have  such an effect 
in addition nota prohibits the acquisition or transfer of human organs for valuable consideration for use in human transplantation 
nota permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the removal  transportation  implantation  processing  preservation  quality control  and storage of human organs 
we cannot be certain that restrictive interpretations of nota will not be adopted in the future which will challenge one or more aspects of industry methods of charging for preservation services 
our laboratory operations and those of our competitors are subject to the us department of labor  occupational safety and health administration and environmental protection agency requirements for prevention of occupational exposure to infectious agents and hazardous chemicals and protection of the environment 
some states have enacted statutes and regulations which govern the processing  transportation and storage of human organs and tissue 
us and foreign governments and regulatory agencies may adopt more restrictive laws or regulations in the future that could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
uncertainties related to patents and protection of proprietary technology may adversely affect the value of our intellectual property 
we own several patents  patent applications  and licenses relating to our technologies  which we believe provide us with important competitive advantages 
we cannot be certain that our pending patent applications will issue as patents or that no one will challenge the validity or enforceability of any patent that we own 
we also cannot be certain that if anyone does make such a challenge  that we will be able to successfully defend that challenge 
we may have to incur substantial litigation costs to uphold the validity and prevent infringement of a patent 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that competitors will not independently develop similar technologies or duplicate our technologies or design around the patented aspects of such technologies 
we cannot be sure that our proposed technologies will not infringe patents or other rights owned by others 
we protect our proprietary technologies and processes in part by confidentiality agreements with our collaborative partners  employees and consultants 
we cannot be sure that these entities and persons will not breach these agreements  that we will have adequate remedies for any breach  or that our trade secrets will not otherwise become known or independently discovered by competitors 
if any of these events occur  they could result in our loss of the economic benefits associated with our key products and services and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
future health care reimbursement methods and policies may affect the availability  amount and timing of our revenues 
even though we do not receive payments directly from third party health care payors  their reimbursement methods and policies impact demand for our cryopreserved tissue and other services and products 
our preservation services with respect to the cardiac  vascular  and orthopaedic tissues may be particularly susceptible to third party cost containment measures 
for example  the initial cost of a cryopreserved allograft heart valve generally exceeds the cost of a mechanical  synthetic  or animal derived valve 
we are unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods and policies utilized by third party health care payors or their effect on us 
if third party health care payors  including medicare  change their reimbursement methods and policies with respect to cryopreserved tissues provided for implant by us and other services and products that we offer  this could have a material adverse effect on us 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved health care products and services  and there can be no assurance that adequate third party coverage will be available for us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in developing new products 
government  hospitals  and other third party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement for new products approved for marketing by the fda 
in some cases  these entities refuse to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for indications for which the fda has not granted marketing approval 
if government and other third party payors do not provide adequate coverage and reimbursement levels for uses of our new products and services  market acceptance of these products would be adversely affected  which could negatively impact revenue growth and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
rapid technological change could cause our services and products to become obsolete 
the technologies underlying our products and services are subject to rapid and profound technological change 
competition intensifies as technical advances in each field are made and become more widely known 
we can give no assurance that others will not develop products or processes with significant advantages over the products and processes that we offer or are seeking to develop 
any such occurrence could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
risks related to our capital stock trading prices for our securities have been  and may continue to be  volatile 
the trading price of our common and preferred stock has been subject to wide fluctuations and may continue to be volatile in the future 
trading price fluctuations can be caused by a variety of factors  including variations in operating results  regulatory actions such as the adverse fda activity  product liability claims  announcement of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  governmental regulatory acts  developments with respect to patents or proprietary rights  general conditions in the medical device or service industries  actions taken by government regulators  changes in earnings estimates by securities analysts  or other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our revenues or operating results in future quarters fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors  the price of our common and preferred stock would likely decline  perhaps substantially 
changes in the trading price of our common and preferred stock may bear no relation to our actual operational or financial results 
if our share prices do not meet the requirements of the new york stock exchange  our shares may be delisted 
our closing common stock price in the period january  to february  has ranged from a high of to a low of 
our closing preferred stock price in the period march   the date of our first preferred stock issuance  to february  has ranged from a high of to a low of 
the market prices of the securities of biotechnology companies have been highly volatile and are likely to remain highly volatile in the future 
this volatility has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
in the past  companies that experienced volatility in the market price of their securities have often faced securities class action litigation 
moreover  market prices for stocks of biotechnology related and technology companies frequently reach levels that bear no relationship to the operating performance of these companies 
these market prices generally are not sustainable and are highly volatile 
whether or not meritorious  litigation brought against us could result in substantial costs  divert our management s attention and resources and harm our financial condition and results of operations 
anti takeover provisions may discourage or make more difficult an attempt to obtain control of cryolife 
our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may discourage or make more difficult any attempt by a person or group to obtain control of our company  including provisions authorizing the issuance of preferred stock without shareholder approval  restricting the persons who may call a special meeting of the shareholders  and prohibiting shareholders from taking action by written consent 
in addition  we are subject to certain provisions of florida law that may discourage or make more difficult takeover attempts or acquisitions of substantial amounts of our common stock 
further  pursuant to the terms of a shareholder rights plan adopted in and amended in  each outstanding share of common stock has one attached right 
the rights will cause substantial dilution of the ownership of a person or group that attempts to acquire our company on terms not approved by the board of directors and may deter hostile takeover attempts 
these provisions could potentially deprive our stockholders of opportunities to sell shares of our stock at above market prices 
we are not likely to pay common stock dividends in the foreseeable future  and we may not be able to pay cash dividends on our capital stock due to legal and contractual restrictions and lack of liquidity 
we have not paid  and do not presently intend to pay  cash dividends on our common stock 
in addition  under florida law and under the restrictions set forth in our credit agreement  we may not be able to pay cash dividends on our capital stock 
under florida law  no distribution may be paid on our capital stock  if after giving it effect we would not be able to pay our debts as they become due in the usual course of business  or our total assets would be less than the sum of our total liabilities plus the amount that would be needed  if we were to be dissolved at the time of the distribution  to satisfy the preferential rights upon dissolution of our preferred shareholders whose preferential rights are superior to those receiving the distribution 
under our new credit agreement  cash dividends on common stock are prohibited  and cash dividends on preferred stock may be paid only so long as we maintain at least million  in the aggregate  of borrowing capacity under the credit agreement plus cash  and specified cash equivalents  see risks factors risks relating to our business we may be unable to comply with the covenants of our credit facility  which would limit our borrowing capacity and potentially result in a default under the credit facility  and our credit facility limits our ability to issue additional debt or pay cash dividends 
increased borrowings under the credit agreement and judgments or settlements arising out of product liability or other claims  negative operating cash flow and other factors which adversely affect available cash resources  will also adversely affect our ability to make cash dividend payments both generally and under the credit agreement 
in addition  the terms of any future financing arrangements that we may enter into may also restrict our ability to pay dividends

item legal proceedings 
product liability claims in the normal course of business as a medical device and services company  the company has product liability complaints filed against it 
as of february  the company was aware of three pending product liability lawsuits 
the lawsuits are currently in the pre discovery or discovery stages 
of these lawsuits  two allege product liability claims arising out of the company s allograft heart valve tissue services  and one alleges a product liability claim arising from the company s allograft orthopaedic tissue services 
two of the outstanding product liability lawsuits against the company are not covered by insurance  as the claimed loss date was prior to the effective coverage date for its insurance policy 
additional uninsured claims may be filed in the future 
other product liability claims have been asserted against the company that have not resulted in lawsuits as of february  the company is monitoring these claims 
the company performed an analysis as of december  of the settled but unpaid claims and the pending product liability claims based on settlement negotiations to date and advice from counsel 
as of december  the company had accrued a total of approximately  for pending product liability 
the  accrual is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
this amount represents the company s estimate of the probable losses related to one of the three pending product liability claims 
the company has not recorded an accrual for the remaining two product liability claims because management has concluded that either a loss is remote or that  although a loss is reasonably possible or probable  a reasonable estimate of that loss or the range of losses cannot be made at this time 
as of december  the company had accrued a total of approximately million for settled but unpaid claims and pending product liability claims and recorded  representing amounts to be recovered from the company s insurance carriers 
the million accrual is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
if the company is unable to settle one or more of the product liability lawsuits in which the company is a defendant  and if any such lawsuit should be tried with a substantial verdict rendered in favor of the plaintiff s  there can be no assurance that such verdict s would not exceed the company s available liquid assets 
additionally  the company does not have a reasonable method for estimating the amount of compensatory or punitive damages that could be assessed by a trial jury with respect to any lawsuit that it is unable to settle prior to trial  and the company s product liability insurance policies do not include coverage for any punitive damages 
failure by the company to resolve the outstanding product liability claims within its ability to pay would have a material adverse effect on the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of the company 
on april  the company bound coverage for the insurance policy year 
this policy is a four year claims made insurance policy  ie claims incurred during the period april  through march  and reported during the period april  through march  are covered by this policy 
claims incurred prior to april  that have not been reported are uninsured 
the company maintains claims made insurance policies to mitigate its financial exposure to product liability claims 
claims made insurance policies generally cover only those asserted claims and incidents that are reported to the insurance carrier while the policy is in effect 
thus  a claims made policy does not generally represent a transfer of risk for claims and incidents that have been incurred but not reported to the insurance carrier during the policy period 
the company periodically evaluates its exposure to unreported product liability claims and records accruals as necessary for the estimated cost of unreported claims related to services performed and products used 
in january the company retained an independent actuarial firm to perform revised estimates of the unreported claims as of december  the independent firm estimated the unreported product loss liability using a frequency severity approach  whereby projected losses were calculated by multiplying the estimated number of claims by the estimated average cost per claim 
the estimated claims were calculated based on the reported claim development method and the bornhuetter ferguson method using a blend of the company s historical claim experience and industry data 
the estimated cost per claim was calculated using a lognormal claims model blending the company s historical average cost per claim with industry claims data 
the independent actuarial firm used a number of assumptions in order to estimate the unreported product loss liability including a ceiling of million was selected for actuarial purposes in determining the liability per claim given the uncertainty in projecting claim losses in excess of million  the future claim reporting lag time would be a blend of the company s experiences and industry data  the frequency of unreported claims for accident years through would be lower than the company s experience in the policy year  but higher than the company s historical claim frequency prior to the policy year  the average cost per claim would be lower than the company s experience since the policy year  but higher than the company s historical cost per claim prior to the policy year  the average cost per bioglue claim would be consistent with the company s overall historical exposures until adequate historical data is available on this product line  and the number of bioglue claims per million dollars of bioglue revenue would be lower than non bioglue claims per million dollars of revenue 
the factor was selected based on bioglue claims experience to date and consultation with the actuary 
the company believes that these assumptions provide a reasonable basis for the calculation of the unreported product liability loss  but accuracy of the actuarial firm s estimates is limited by the general uncertainty that exists for any estimate of future activity due to uncertainties surrounding the assumptions used and due to company specific conditions  including the company s increased litigation activity following the fda order  the company s low volume of pre fda order historical claims  and the scarcity of industry data directly relevant to the company s business activities 
due to these factors  actual results may differ significantly from the assumptions used and amounts accrued 
based on the actuarial valuation performed in january as of december   the company estimated that its liability for unreported product liability claims was million as of december  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  the company has accrued million  representing the company s best estimate of the total liability for unreported product liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december  the million balance is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million and other long term liabilities of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
further analysis indicated that the liability could be estimated to be as high as million  after including a reasonable margin for statistical fluctuations calculated based on actuarial simulation techniques 
based on the actuarial valuation  the company estimated that as of december   million of the accrual for unreported liability claims would be recoverable under the company s insurance policies 
the million insurance recoverable is included as a component of other receivables of million and other long term assets of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
these amounts represent management s estimate of the probable losses and anticipated recoveries for unreported product liability claims related to services performed and products sold prior to december  actual results may differ from this estimate 
as of december  the company accrued million for unreported product liability claims and recorded a receivable of million for unreported liability claims estimated to be recoverable under the company s insurance policies 
this million accrual is included as a component of accrued expenses and other current liabilities of million and other long term liabilities of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
the million insurance recoverable is included as a component of other current receivables of million and other long term assets of million on the december  consolidated balance sheet 
insurance coverage dispute in september the company favorably settled insurance coverage disputes with former insurance carriers for million  net of associated legal fees 
the disputes involved losses stemming from approximately million paid in by the company in settlement of outstanding claims 
no party admitted any liability as part of the september settlement 
the net proceeds of million were received in october and are included as a component of general  administrative  and marketing expenses on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  sec investigation on august  the company issued a press release announcing that on august   the company received a letter from the atlanta district office of the sec inquiring about certain matters relating to the company s august  announcement of the fda order 
the sec notified the company in july that the inquiry became a formal investigation in june cryolife cooperated with this investigation both before and after the issuance of the formal order of investigation in june and intends to continue doing so 
cryolife voluntarily reported the names of six employees and former employees to the sec in december after discovering they had apparently sold cryolife shares on august   before trading was halted pending cryolife s press release reporting the fda order 
these individuals were not and are not executive officers of cryolife 
the formal order of investigation indicates that the sec s scope includes whether  during  among other things  cryolife or others may have traded while in possession of material nonpublic information  made or caused to be made false or misleading statements or omissions in press releases and sec filings  and failed to maintain accurate records and adequate controls 
the investigation could also encompass matters not specifically identified in the formal order 
on september  the sec announced that it had commenced proceedings in federal district court against certain of the above referenced former and current employees and certain of their spouses for alleged illegal insider trading arising out of their august  trading activities 
those proceedings resulted in settlements with the sec 
as of the date hereof  the sec has had no discussions with cryolife as to whether the sec will seek relief against cryolife  or the nature of any relief that may be sought 
at present  cryolife is unable to predict the ultimate focus  its current status  outcome of the investigation  or when it will be completed 
an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on cryolife s reputation  business  financial position  results of operations  and cash flows
