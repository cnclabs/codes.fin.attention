general the following discussion and analysis provides information management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of computer sciences corporation csc or the company 
the discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended march  there are three primary objectives of this discussion to provide a narrative explanation of the consolidated financial statements  as presented through the eyes of management  to enhance the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes  providing context within which the consolidated financial statements should be analyzed  and to provide information to assist the reader in ascertaining the predictive value of the reported financial results 
to achieve these objectives  the discussion is presented in the following sections overview includes a brief description of the business and how it earns revenue and generates cash  as well as a discussion of the key business drivers  economic and industry factors  fiscal highlights and fiscal commentary

overview the company s primary service offerings are outsourcing and i t and professional services 
outsourcing activities include operating all or a portion of a customer s technology infrastructure and applications  and business process outsourcing 
i t and professional services include systems integration  consulting and other professional services and software systems sales and related services 
csc provides these services to customers in the global commercial and north american public sector markets 
on a geographic basis  csc provides services to global commercial customers in the united states  europe and other international locations 
operations in australia  asia and canada generate substantially all revenue within other international 
economic and industry factors global commercial markets are affected by various economic and industry factors 
the economic environment in the regions csc serves will impact customers decisions for discretionary spending on i t projects 
csc is in a highly competitive industry which exerts downward pressure on pricing and requires companies to continually seek ways to differentiate themselves through several factors  including service offerings and flexibility 
management monitors industry factors including relative market shares  growth rates  billing rates  staff utilization rates and margins as well as macroeconomic indicators such as interest rates  inflation rates and foreign currency rates 
the north american public sector market is also highly competitive and has unique characteristics 
all us government contracts and subcontracts may be modified  curtailed or terminated at the convenience of the government if program requirements or budgetary constraints change 
in the event that a contract is terminated for convenience  the company generally is reimbursed for its allowable costs through the date of termination and is paid a proportionate amount of the stipulated profit or fee attributable to the work performed 
shifting priorities of the us government can also impact the future of projects 
the company recognized the us government s increased priorities on defense and homeland security programs and has focused business development efforts in these areas 
management monitors government priorities and industry factors through numerous industry and government publications and forecasts  legislative activity  budgeting and appropriation processes and by participating in industry professional associations 
business drivers revenue is generated by providing services on a variety of contract vehicles lasting from less than six months to years or more 
factors affecting revenue include the company s ability to successfully bid on and win new contract awards  the ability to satisfy existing customers and obtain add on business and win contract re competes  the ability to compete on price  services offered  technical ability  experience and flexibility  the ability to successfully identify and integrate acquisitions and leverage them to generate new revenues  the ability to successfully identify and divest non core operations which may impact revenue in the short term but provide resources to pursue longer term growth and value creation opportunities  and currency fluctuations related to international operations 
earnings are driven by the above revenue factors  in addition to the following the ability to control costs  particularly labor costs  subcontractor expenses and overhead costs including healthcare  pension and general and administrative costs  the ability to anticipate headcount needs to avoid staff shortages or excesses  the ability to accurately estimate various factors incorporated in contract bids and proposals  and the ability to develop offshore capabilities and migrate compatible service offerings offshore 
cash flows are impacted by the above earnings factors  in addition to other factors including the following timely management of receivables and payables  investment opportunities available  particularly related to business acquisitions and dispositions and large outsourcing contracts  and the ability to efficiently manage capital including debt and equity instruments 
key performance indicators the company manages and assesses the performance of its business through various means  with the primary financial measures including new contract wins  revenue growth  margins  cash flow and return on investment 
new contract wins in addition to being a primary driver of future revenue  focusing on new contract wins also provides management an assessment of the company s ability to compete 
the total level of wins tends to fluctuate from year to year depending on the timing of new and recompeted contracts as well as numerous external factors 
csc employs stringent financial and operational reviews and discipline in the new contract process to evaluate risks and generate appropriate margins and returns from new contracts 
revenue growth year over year revenues tend to vary less than new contract wins  and reflect performance on both new and existing contracts 
with a wide array of services offered  the company is able to pursue additional work from existing customers 
in addition  incremental increases in revenue will not necessarily result in linear increases in costs  particularly overhead and other indirect costs  thus potentially improving profit margins 
foreign currency fluctuations also impact revenue growth 
margins margins reflect the company s performance on contracts and ability to control costs 
while the ratios of various cost elements as a percentage of revenue can shift as a result of acquisitions or dispositions of business with different cost profiles  a focus on maintaining and improving overall margins leads to improved efficiencies and profitability 
although the majority of the company s costs are denominated in the same currency as revenues  increased use of offshore support also exposes csc to additional margin fluctuations 
cash flow over time the primary drivers of the company s cash flow are earnings provided by the company s operations and the use of capital to generate those earnings 
also contributing to short term cash flow results are movements in current asset and liability balances 
the company also regularly reviews the us generally accepted accounting principles gaap cash flow measurements of operating  investing and financing cash flows  as well as non gaap free cash flow 
return on investment roi roi is an effective indicator combining a focus on margins with efficient and productive net asset utilization 
a combination of strong margins measuring how efficiently profit is generated from revenue and investment base turnover measuring how effectively revenue is generated from investors capital is required to generate sufficient returns on capital 
strong working capital management also serves to minimize investment capital and increase returns 
readers should be cautioned that days sales outstanding dso  free cash flow and roi are not gaap measures  and the company s definition of such measures may differ from other companies 
therefore  such measures may not be comparable to those of other companies 
csc thinks these non gaap financial measures provide useful information to investors regarding the company s financial condition and results of operations as they provide another measure of the company s performance and ability to service its debt 
csc calculates dso as follows total receivables at quarter end divided by revenue per day 
revenue per day equals total revenues for the quarter divided by the number of days in the fiscal quarter 
free cash flow is equal to the sum of operating cash flows  investing cash flows  excluding business acquisitions and dispositions  purchase or sale of available for sale securities and capital lease payments 
roi is calculated by multiplying profit margin times investment base turnover 
the profit margin used is profit before interest and special items and after tax divided by revenues 
investment base turnover equals revenues divided by average debt and equity 
fiscal highlights significant events during fiscal include revenues rose  though declined on a constant currency basis 
the company recorded a special pretax restructuring charge of million after tax or per share and a special pretax gain of million million after tax or cents per share 
legal and other costs associated with the stock option investigation  including costs incurred to obtain debt covenant waivers and employee income taxes related to the stock option investigation were million million after tax or cents per share 
income from continuing operations  including the restructuring charge  was million compared to million for the prior year a decline of 
continuing earnings per share  after special charges  were down 
the fiscal special charge of per share  as compared to the prior year special charge of cents per share  adversely impacted earnings per share from continuing operations compared to prior year by announced contract awards of billion with new north american public sector awards of billion  and new global commercial awards totaling billion  an increase of in announced awards from the prior year 
the company entered into two accelerated share repurchase transactions during the year 
in the first quarter of fiscal the company acquired and retired million shares of outstanding common shares for million and during the second quarter the company acquired and retired an additional million shares for million 
free cash flow of million increased million from million in fiscal  including million disbursed for restructuring activities  as well as approximately million deferred income recognition and delayed payments on capital expenditures the magnitude of which are not representative of the company s ongoing cash flow trends 
the following is a reconciliation of free cash flow to the most directly comparable generally accepted accounting principles gaap financial measure fiscal year ended in millions march  march  april  free cash flow net cash used in investing activities proceeds from redemption of preferred stock acquisition  net of cash acquired business dispositions capital lease payments sale of available for sale securities net cash provided by operating activities capital lease payments and proceeds from the sale of property and equipment included in investing activities are included in the calculation of free cash flow 
prior periods have been adjusted to conform with this presentation 
dso was days at year end versus days at the end of the prior year 
debt to total capitalization ratio was at year end  an increase of points from the prior year ratio 
roi from continuing operations was for the year a point improvement from prior year 
the company s significant wins during fiscal included the following global commercial united kingdom national health service billion  blue scope steel million  tdc million  and ukvisas million 
north american public sector us army program executive office for enterprise information systems billion  us agency for international development million  u 
s air force expeditionary combat support system million  new york department of health million  and us department of health and human services million 
these multi year awards represent the estimated value of the company s portion at contract signing 
they cannot be considered firm orders  however  due to their variable attributes  including demand driven usage  modifications in scope of work due to changing customer requirements  annual funding constraints and indefinite delivery indefinite quantity characteristics of major portions of the company s north american public sector activities 
the limited revenue growth  a decline on a constant currency basis  in the global commercial sector and the decrease in awards during the first half of fiscal reflect  in part  the impact on the company s ability to secure new awards as a result of the company s evaluation of strategic initiatives during the first part of the fiscal as well as the general trend in the industry towards smaller scope and or shorter term outsourcing contracts 
the majority of new awards for the global commercial sector  with the exception of the national heath service award  were awarded during the last half of the fiscal year 
the north american public sector continued to win a share of us federal government contracts as its total contract awards for fiscal increased by from the previous fiscal year with contract awards from the department of defense continuing to lead the way 
currency shifts during fiscal favorably impacted revenue and largely offset declines in constant currency revenue in europe 
the company s growth in prior years has created a broad  long term global revenue base across numerous customers  industries  geographic regions and service offerings with approximately of csc s revenues derived from long term contracts including global commercial outsourcing and us federal government engagements 
this revenue base provides the company with a relatively stable base of revenue during periods when contract awards may slow or the market for certain services softens 
a reduction in working capital was the result of an increase in payables and deferred income which was partially offset by increases in receivables and prepaid expenses as well as an increase in cash paid for taxes and cash paid for restructuring activities 
the net effect was a modest increase in cash flow from operations for fiscal the increase in deferred income  approximately million  is not expected to recur at a similar amount during fiscal cash out flow for investing activities declined from prior year as a result of lower levels of investment in outsourcing contracts and equipment 
contributing to the decline  the company exited fiscal with capital expenditures unpaid and reflected in accounts payable of approximately million in excess of usual levels of such activity 
these purchases will be reported as fiscal outflows 
outflows for financing activities reflect the company s acquisition and retirement of million shares of outstanding common stock during fiscal fiscal commentary as a leading federal contractor and one of the top i t service providers to the us federal government  csc s north american public sector is well positioned to benefit from continued demand for i t services in this market 
the us federal government is one of the world s largest i t services consumers  and its spending is expected to continue to increase during the upcoming year in order to improve technologies in the areas of defense  homeland security and civil agency modernization 
while the ultimate distribution of us federal funds and project assignments can vary  the company expects its broad i t and outsourcing capabilities to be viewed favorably by the us federal government 
global commercial market awards during the fourth quarter of fiscal were the highest quarterly total during the past two fiscal years 
this reversed the trend of the four quarters preceding the fourth quarter of fiscal which were adversely impacted by the market s response to the company s consideration of strategic alternatives 
a key success for the company was the award of two additional regions for the implementation of a record keeping system for the united kingdom s national health service 
the awards for commercial engagements during the fourth quarter of fiscal rebounded  and the pipeline of future prospects is showing some growth 
the company has been and will continue to be selective in new business pursuit opportunities given the focus on margin expansion and increasing return on investment 
with respect to discretionary spending and project work  central and southern europe continue to show areas of soft demand  and demand in north america for consulting and systems integration did not show significant improvement  while price pressures continue 
while the future demand for outsourcing services is not known with certainty  the long term nature of major outsourcing engagements allows csc to benefit from a certain level of continuity 
growth during fiscal in global commercial revenue from new business awarded during fiscal is expected to be tempered by the continued demand for offshore services and the resulting pressure on prices 
during fiscal  the company s global commercial segment s revenue was favorably impacted by currency fluctuations in europe and other international regions 
the company cannot forecast with certainty future movement in currency exchange rates or its impact on operating results 
other trends the company expects for fiscal are as follows revenue for the north american public sector for fiscal will benefit from its billion of announced awards 
this represents a billion increase in awards during fiscal the north american public sector is expected to continue to grow at or above the revenue growth rate for fiscal the company expects global commercial revenue growth to be tempered by the previous softness in new contract awards during the later part of fiscal and first half of fiscal in addition  adjustments of billing rates to industry benchmarks for certain significant outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal and  as these contracts mature  may also temper revenue growth for the global commercial segment 
the demand for offshore services is expected to continue to increase as customers seek to lower costs and will present opportunity as well as temper revenue growth in europe as well as the us commercial market 
the company has identified and expects to pursue billion of federal opportunities that will be awarded in fiscal  plus an additional billion during fiscal the company expects to win a share of these awards 
cash flow from operations for fiscal is expected to decrease slightly from the  million for fiscal fiscal operating cash flow is expected to be adversely impacted by a decline in deferred income 
cash outflow from investing activities is expected to increase from fiscal levels primarily as a result of investment in computers and related equipment in the us commercial and north american public sector and for capital assets acquired in fiscal but paid for during fiscal the company s overall short term financial objectives include successfully launch the new contracts won during fiscal manage ongoing engagements to maximize revenue and margins 
successfully close and integrate the acquisition of covansys corporation 
effectively manage working capital and capital investment 
maintain appropriate investment base turnover rates and operating margins  with particular emphasis on the new business  in order to improve return on investment

north american public sector revenue growth for fiscal was with revenue up million to  million 
the revenue growth was the result of new business awarded during fiscal and  increases on existing department of defense contracts and the acquisition in the third quarter of an identity management and credentialing business

for fiscal north american public sector revenue growth was with revenue up million to  million 
the revenue growth was driven by new business awarded during fiscal and and increases on existing department of defense contracts

the global commercial ratio was essentially flat to the prior year as improvements in the ratio from savings in new business selling costs due to fewer significant new business opportunities and a reduction in general and administrative costs was offset by the increase in compensation costs as a result of the restatement noted above and the adverse impact of a pre tax million provision for doubtful accounts related to negotiations with an outsourcing customer regarding certain contract provisions 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue decreased 
points to during fiscal the expense ratio improved in both the north american public sector and in global commercial 
the decrease in the expense ratio was the result of revenue growth and a decline in depreciation and amortization expense to  million for fiscal this decline was the result of an approximately million decrease in depreciation expense for fiscal due primarily to the termination and disposal of the related assets for the sears contract and a shift in the mix of the assets in australia toward longer lived assets 
the north american public sector ratio decreased by 
points as depreciation and amortization expense was held flat and revenue increased by 
the global commercial ratio decreased 
point due to the reduction in expense noted above while revenues were essentially flat to the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expense of  million for fiscal represents of revenue and was unchanged from the ratio of for fiscal improvement in the north american public sector ratio was offset by an increase in the global commercial ratio 
the north american public sector ratio decreased by 
point predominantly due to decreases in amortization of certain intangibles acquired in the dyncorp acquisition 
the global commercial ratio increased as a result of significant upfront capital investment for outsourcing contracts awarded during fiscal and in europe and asia and capital refreshes necessary on some existing contracts  offset by lower levels of capital investment for us commercial operations due to the termination of the nortel and sears contracts and a favorable mix variance from australian operations due to revenue growth in non capital intensive business lines 
interest expense and interest income the increase in interest expense for fiscal of was the result  primarily  of three factors the use of commercial paper to finance the accelerated share repurchase transactions see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements which increased interest from commercial paper by million for fiscal  an increase in equipment under capital leases  particularly in the north american public sector  resulted in an increase in interest expense of million  and interest accrued related to income taxes and income tax contingency items of million see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest income increased approximately million for fiscal as a result of an increase in interest income from tax refund items  interest income from a partnership and interest on cash balances in asia and canada 
these increases offset the loss of dividend income from the dyncorp international preferred stock which was redeemed during the first quarter of fiscal the result of the increase in interest expense and interest income was an increase in net interest expense of million and an increase in the interest expense ratio of 
points 
the decrease in interest expense for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower average debt levels during fiscal as the result of the retirement of billion of term debt during march the interest savings from the retirement of the term debt was somewhat offset by an increase in interest expense for income taxes  capitalized leases and short term borrowings for working capital needs in europe 
the combination of these factors resulted in a reduction in interest expense of million 
in addition  interest income  including dividend income from the dyncorp international preferred stock  increased approximately million for fiscal resulting in a 
improvement in the net interest expense ratio 
during may  the company received approximately million from dyncorp international for the redemption of the preferred stock and payment of cumulative dividends of approximately million 
special items special items totaling million were recorded during the year ended march   and consisted of a million restructuring charge see discussion below  a million true up of an estimate related to the fiscal nortel impairment charge and an million gain from the redemption of dyncorp international preferred stock 
restructuring in april  the company announced a restructuring plan to be carried out during fiscal and the objectives of the plan are to streamline csc s worldwide operations and leverage the increased use of lower cost global resources 
restructuring charges consist predominantly of severance and related employee payments resulting from terminations 
during the third quarter of fiscal the company evaluated facility consolidation opportunities and other areas where operations can be streamlined and costs reduced consistent with the plan objectives  resulting in additional lease termination  asset impairment and other charges 
workforce reductions of approximately  employees occurred in fiscal  and an additional  reductions are planned for fiscal termination related charges of million were recorded in fiscal other  primarily vacant space related costs  of million were also recorded during the year  net of an million gain on the sale of a data center facility 
all but approximately 
million of the restructuring charge was incurred in the global commercial reporting segment 
additional restructuring charges of not more than million are expected to be incurred in fiscal the restructuring plan generated savings of approximately million in fiscal and is expected to result in savings of million in fiscal approximately of the savings comes from reduced cost of services  while the remainder will be predominantly from lower selling  general and administrative costs 
savings are net of new or increased recurring costs  primarily the costs anticipated for an increasing offshore workforce 
savings will also be impacted by certain transitional costs as new offshore staff are trained while outgoing staff are still on the payrolls 
such transitional costs were under million in fiscal and expected to be under million in fiscal a majority of the planned headcount reductions  in fiscal and in were scheduled to take place in europe 
approximately  and positions were to be reduced in north america in fiscal and  respectively  with the balance in australia and asia 
partially offsetting the reductions were planned headcount increases in certain lower cost regions of approximately  and employees in fiscal and  respectively 
as of march   approximately  separations have been completed approximately one sixth due to attrition  with  in europe   in north america and the remainder in australia and asia 
approximately  new hires occurred in lower cost regions during the full year ended march   including replacements of some of the  reductions as well as for previously planned and on going business activities 
the company s strategy in europe has been to obtain negotiated  voluntary terminations to the extent possible  but involuntary terminations were also necessary in certain countries to attain targeted reductions 
outside of europe  terminations have been predominantly involuntary 
involuntary termination benefits are determined in accordance with existing company policies and local legal requirements 
in some countries  local regulations require the company to consult with employee representatives such as works councils or unions in the determination of job categories and number of employees to be terminated  as well as the resulting termination benefit amounts 
the amounts of termination benefits are typically attributable to employees services already rendered and increase as length of service increases 
the company records charges for negotiated  voluntary terminations at the time an employee accepts the company s offer 
involuntary termination benefits are accrued at the time such obligations are considered probable and reasonably estimable 
such a calculation is based on estimates of benefit payouts as well as number and type of staff to be terminated 
in cases where a plan calls for first attempting to garner voluntary terminations and then moves to involuntary terminations if targeted reductions are not achieved  a charge is accrued based on estimated involuntary benefits for all remaining reductions 
accruals for future termination benefits are based on a number of assumptions and estimates 
such accruals may differ from actual results for a variety of reasons  including different benefit amounts or mix of employees as a result of completed employee representative consultations  additional voluntary terminations in lieu of accrued involuntary terminations  changes in mix of actual terminated employees by age  years of service  or job class 
restructuring related pre tax cash payments of approximately million were made in fiscal excluding million cash proceeds received from sale of a data center and are estimated to be approximately million for fiscal included in the restructuring charge are pension benefit augmentations that are due to certain employees in accordance with legal or contractual obligations  which will be paid out over several years as part of normal pension distributions 
such liabilities are included in the consolidated pension liability account 
see the following table for a summary of fiscal activity in millions total pre tax charges recorded year to date fiscal less charges not affecting restructuring liability less payments other restructuring liability as of march  workforce reductions other total charges primarily consist of pension benefit augmentations offset by gains on sale of a data center facility 
excludes million cash proceeds received from sale of a data center facility 
foreign currency translation adjustments 
during fiscal nortel networks nortel terminated the company s services for certain information technology outsourcing activities under the outsourcing agreement between nortel and the company 
as a result of the termination of these services the company recorded a non cash special charge of million in the second quarter of fiscal to write down outsourcing contract costs and certain equipment associated with the contract to their estimated fair value 
the company recorded an additional charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal of million to write down the remaining assets to fair value  recognize a loss on the assets sold to nortel under the terms of the termination settlement  record severance costs for those employees who were not hired by nortel or redeployed within the company and record costs associated with terminating the contract for a total charge of million million after tax or cents per share 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the company recorded a charge of million for premium payments and the write down of deferred financing costs and interest discount related to the early redemption of billion of term debt 
the company elected to make this early redemption and incur the charges as it had available cash and these debt issues carried interest rates above current prevailing rates 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further description 
the debt redemption charge was partially offset by the reversal in the fourth quarter of previously recorded facility restructuring accruals of 
million 
the combined special items had a per share impact on earnings per share and a 
net impact on the company s profit margin in fiscal taxes the provision for taxes on continuing operations as a percentage of pre tax earnings was  and for fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate during fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of lower state tax and additional credits in fiscal  partially offset by higher foreign effective tax rates 
the company s income tax expense for fiscal includes a reduction for a change in estimate in the amount of approximately million of research and development credits available to be claimed by the company for years prior to fiscal as a result of these factors  the effective tax rate for fiscal declined percentage points from fiscal the increase in fiscal income tax expense compared to fiscal was primarily the result a reduction in tax contingency recorded in fiscal which did not recur in fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations net of taxes was million and million  respectively  for fiscal years and income from discontinued operations during fiscal included the gain on sale of health plan solutions of million and the gain from the working capital adjustment for the sale of dyncorp international of million 
the company received million par value preferred stock for the working capital adjustment and recorded taxes of million and a valuation allowance of approximately million against the preferred stock 
income from discontinued operations during fiscal includes the net after tax gain on the sale of dyncorp international of million or approximately per share 
in fiscal  proceeds from the sale included million of cash and million of par value preferred stock 
discontinued operations for fiscal included the operations of dyncorp international  sold during the fourth quarter of fiscal  and the operations of health plan solutions which was classified as held for sale as of april  and sold during the first quarter of fiscal cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations an interpretation of fasb statement no 
during fiscal  the company recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million million after tax or per share as a result of implementing the interpretation to account for the company s unrecorded legal obligations to restore some of its leased facilities to their original condition upon lease expiration 
earnings per share and share base earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal as compared to fiscal decreased to 
earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal were adversely impacted by special charges of per share and favorably impacted by a decrease in the average share base of million shares from fiscal this decline in the share base was the result of the company s acquisition and retirement of million shares through two accelerated share repurchase transactions with million shares acquired during the first quarter and million shares acquired during the second quarter of fiscal see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these transactions 
this reduction to the share base was partially offset by option exercises during the past twelve months and an increase in common stock equivalents of million for fiscal earnings per share from continuing operations increased to for fiscal earnings per share from continuing operations for fiscal were adversely impacted by special charges of per share and a decrease in income from continuing operations and favorably impacted by a decline in the average share base of million shares for fiscal this decline in the share base was driven primarily by the company s acquisition of million treasury shares in the hps exchange which reduced weighted average shares outstanding by million shares for fiscal this reduction was partially offset by employee stock option exercises during fiscal common stock equivalents declined slightly on a year over year basis 
financial condition cash flows dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal net cash from operations net cash used in investing net cash used in financing effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year cash and cash equivalents at end of year historically  the majority of the company s cash and cash equivalents have been provided from operating activities and this trend continued during fiscal as operating activities generated an additional million in cash compared to the prior year or billion in net cash during fiscal cash generated from operations during fiscal was the result of factors with significant  but opposing  impacts on cash flow  including cash outflows to fund the restructuring plan and cash inflows from advanced customer payments 
factors impacting working capital during the year include during fiscal cash payments for restructuring activities were million  net of million from the sale of assets related to the restructuring  during fiscal during fiscal the company s billed trade accounts receivables and unbilled receivables increased approximately million and million  respectively 
the increase in trade receivables was across both the north american public sector and the global commercial segments 
the increase in unbilled receivables related primarily to contracts in europe and us federal contracts 
this compares to an increase in unbilled receivables of approximately million and a minimal increase in trade accounts receivable during fiscal the fiscal increase in trade accounts receivable and unbilled receivables contributed to an increase in dso to days at the end of fiscal from days at the end of last year 
the company s investment in deferred costs and work in progress related to certain contracts increased approximately million during fiscal compared to an increase of million in the prior year 
the majority of the increase relates to the uk national health service contract 
accounts payable and accrued expenses combined increased million for fiscal compared to a decrease of million for fiscal the increase in the balance for fiscal was the result of the timing of payments for accounts payable  which included an increase of approximately million of capital expenditure payables  an increase in accrued expenses for restructuring activities and activity on contracts 
the company made payments for taxes of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company projects cash payments for taxes to remain at fiscal levels for  however  resolution of tax contingencies could have a significant impact on cash tax payments 
advanced payments received from customers increased approximately million during fiscal  primarily as a result of the achievement of billing milestones on a significant development effort for a foreign government client 
such balances partially offset the company s significant investment in this project 
this compares to a decrease in advanced payments from customers for fiscal as a result of the winding down of a contract and lower advanced payments on another contract as it transitioned out of the start up phase 
the company has submitted requests for equitable adjustment reas totaling in excess of billion on two us federal contracts 
included in current assets on the company s balance sheet is approximately million of unbilled accounts receivable and deferred costs related to the contracts 
csc has requested payment for certain related out of scope work directed or caused by the customers in support of their critical missions 
the contractual modification process for scope changes has lagged behind the need for csc to provide critical on going operational support 
the company does not record any profit element when it defers costs associated with such reas 
the company believes it has a legal basis for pursuing recovery of these reas and that collection is probable 
settlement of the amounts depends on individual circumstances and negotiations with the parties and we are unable to predict the timing of resolution of the reas 
the company s capital investments principally relate to purchases of computer equipment and purchases and development of software  and deferred outsourcing contract costs that have supported the company s expanding global commercial operations in prior years 
investments include computer equipment purchased at the inception of outsourcing contracts as well as for subsequent upgrades  expansion or replacement of these client supporting assets 
for cash flow presentation purposes  the outsourcing contracts line includes amounts paid to clients for assets purchased from the clients that are categorized as property and equipment on the balance sheet 
outsourcing contract costs are also comprised of incremental external costs as well as certain internal costs that directly relate to a contract s acquisition or start up  including payments to clients for amounts in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets premium 
the absence of significant new outsourcing contract awards during the latter part of fiscal and fiscal resulted in a reduction in investing cash outflows for computer equipment and related facilities costs and for outsourcing contract costs 
these reductions in cash outflows were partially offset by cash outflows for the acquisition of an identity management and credentialing business see note in notes to consolidated financial statements and an increase in cash outflows for purchase and development of software as a result of software purchases in europe  primarily for the national health service contract 
while increasing new business will typically require higher overall capital investments  the mix of the new business will also impact the level of capital 
the growth in us federal awards during fiscal limited the growth in overall capital investment in fiscal as us federal contracts typically require lower levels of initial investment when compared with similar commercial outsourcing contracts 
this is expected to continue during fiscal but is expected to be tempered somewhat by revenue resulting from an increase in commercial contract awards during the fourth quarter of fiscal  as well as the payment for capital expenditures incurred during fiscal of approximately million 
dispositions of investments in businesses have from time to time generated investing cash flows for the company 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal the disposition of dyncorp international generated million in cash proceeds 
as discussed below the company used these proceeds to reduce debt levels during that quarter 
as described above  historically a majority of the company s capital investments have been funded by cash from operations 
fiscal continued to reflect this trend  however  the company has increased its use of capital leases to finance certain equipment purchases related to long term contracts with total capital lease obligations of million as of march  the company funded the acquisition and retirement of outstanding shares from two accelerated share repurchase transactions during fiscal with approximately million of commercial paper and cash on hand 
the commercial paper was redeemed during fiscal using cash generated from operating activities 
during fiscal the company financed its capital investments primarily with cash generated from operations 
financing cash flows for fiscal reflected the company s use of the proceeds from the sale of dyncorp international to redeem billion of term debt during the fourth quarter of fiscal cash outflows to redeem the term debt included million of early redemption premiums 
at year end fiscal and  there was no outstanding commercial paper  a result of cash generated from operations 
partially offsetting the financing cash out flows were cash proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options during fiscal and of million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources the balance of cash and cash equivalents was  million at march    million at march   and  million at april  during fiscal  equity decreased million primarily as a result of the company s repurchase of outstanding shares through two accelerated share repurchase transactions and the adoption sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas no 
 which required the recognition of an additional unfunded pension obligation of million million net of taxes on the balance sheet 
the company s total unfunded pension obligation was million at march  in prior years  the unfunded pension obligation would have been disclosed in the notes to the financial statements 
current year earnings of million  the exercise of employee stock options for million and an increase in the foreign currency translation adjustment of million partially offset these reductions 
at the end of fiscal  csc s ratio of debt to total capitalization was  up from the ratio at the end of fiscal of  and from at the end of fiscal the increase in the debt ratio was primarily the result of the decrease in equity due to the share repurchases and the impact of the adoption of sfas no 
as discussed above 
the company s debt to total capitalization ratio of is expected to rise in fiscal as a result of financing the announced acquisition of covansys corporation as well as financing the repurchase of up to billion of outstanding common stock under a rule b purchase plan 
the capitalization ratio may also be impacted during fiscal by the need to finance other suitable investments the company may identify or other significant capital requirements that may arise 
dollars in millions as restated as restated debt equity total capitalization debt to total capitalization the company purchased and retired approximately million outstanding common shares through two accelerated share repurchase transactions for billion during fiscal the first transaction was an accelerated share repurchase agreement for million shares for an initial purchase price of million  or per share  subject to adjustment 
the second transaction was a collared share repurchase agreement under which the company acquired million shares for million 
the number of shares is subject to adjustment upon final determination of the price per share subject to the terms of the collar 
for the collared share repurchase agreement the company has no further obligation and may receive additional shares depending on the final price per share 
these transactions were financed through available cash on hand and the issuance of approximately million of commercial paper which has subsequently been redeemed 
the company s sources of liquidity include cash  commercial paper and committed and uncommitted lines of credit 
short term borrowings are principally used to supplement operating cash flow in funding working capital requirements 
at march   the company had a committed line of credit providing billion of long term commercial paper backup which expires on august  if the company were unable to sell its commercial paper  borrow under its uncommitted lines of credit  or determines it is too costly to do either of the aforementioned  the company has the ability to borrow under this committed line of credit 
this line of credit has the option of being drawn at a base rate  a eurodollar rate or a bid option rate 
the line requires the company to limit liens placed on our assets to million and to liens incurred in the ordinary course of business  maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to consolidated interest expense for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such period not to exceed to  and not permit at the end of any quarterly financial reporting period the ratio of consolidated total debt to consolidated ebitda for the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters ending on or immediately prior to such date  to exceed to 
for further details on this agreement please see exhibit  which is incorporated by reference to this annual report 
as of march  the company s total liquidity was approximately  million which included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of  million and availability under the syndicated backstop credit facility of billion 
as of march   the company had no borrowings under this credit facility and was in compliance with all terms of the agreement 
at march   the company had million of short term borrowings and billion of long term debt 
as further described in note to the consolidated financial statements  commercial paper is classified as short term borrowings 
the company had no outstanding commercial paper as of march  in march  the company used the proceeds from the sale of dyncorp international and cash on hand to redeem the term notes due august  and the term notes due june for million  and an early redemption premium of million 
on march   the company instituted a voluntary share repurchase program for shareholders owning less than shares 
under this program which has now expired  the company repurchased  shares for million on april  and  shares for 
million on may  in the opinion of management  csc will be able to meet its liquidity and cash needs for the foreseeable future through the combination of cash flows from operating activities  cash balances  and unused short term borrowing capacity 
if these resources need to be augmented  major additional cash requirements would likely be financed by the issuance of debt and or equity securities and or the exercise of the put option as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  the company filed a shelf registration statement for up to billion of debt and or equity securities 
the company has previously issued million worth of term debt from the shelf registration  leaving million of shelf available for additional securities 
as a result of the delay in filing its second and third quarter form q s during fiscal the company will not be able to utilize the available shelf registration to issue additional securities until april of there can be no assurances the company will be able to issue debt with acceptable terms 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the following table summarizes the expiration of the company s financial guarantees outstanding as of march  dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total performance guarantees surety bonds letters of credit standby letters of credit foreign subsidiary debt guarantees total see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the following table summarizes the company s payments on contractual obligations by period as of march  dollars in millions less than year years years more than years total long term debt interest on fixed rate debt capital lease obligations bank debt operating leases minimum purchase obligations other long term liabilities total regarding minimum purchase obligations included above  the company has signed long term purchase agreements with certain software  hardware  telecommunication and other service providers to obtain favorable pricing  committed service levels and terms for services necessary for the operation of business activities 
the company is contractually committed to purchase specified service minimums over remaining periods ranging generally from one to five years 
if the company does not meet the specified service minimums  the company may have an obligation to pay the service provider a portion or all of the shortfall 
the above excludes estimated minimum funding requirements for retiree benefit plans as set forth by the employee retirement income security act erisa 
the company has numerous plans  both inside and outside of the us  and determines expected funding requirements on a per plan basis 
the minimum funding requirement can vary significantly from year to year based on a variety of factors  and can be zero in some years 
funding is determined based on a review of benefit obligations and plan assets as well as various regulatory requirements including erisa and cost accounting standards cas applied to us government contracts 
while there are certain minimum contribution requirements  csc may elect to increase the level of funding of contributions based on a number of factors including performance of pension investments  changes in workforce composition and the ability to recover costs on cost reimbursable contracts 
during fiscal  the company expects to make contributions of approximately million to pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the company has not quantified expected contributions beyond fiscal because it is not possible to predict future timing or direction of the capital markets  which can have a significant impact on future minimum funding obligations 
refer to the critical accounting estimates section later in this md a and to note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
fiscal company contributions amounted to million 
these fiscal year contribution figures may differ from those in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements due to the use of a december st measurement date in that note 
dividends and redemption it has been the company s policy to invest earnings in the growth of the company rather than distribute earnings as dividends 
this policy  under which dividends have not been paid since fiscal  is expected to continue  but is subject to review by the board of directors 
critical accounting estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states us gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements under summary of significant accounting policies 
the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with us gaap requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
many of the types of estimates made are for contract specific issues 
changes to estimates or assumptions on a specific contract could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified several critical accounting estimates 
an accounting estimate is considered critical if both a the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved  and b the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting estimates relate to revenue recognition and cost estimation and recoverability on long term  fixed price contracts  revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization  capitalization of outsourcing contract costs and software development costs  estimates used to determine deferred income taxes  assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill  assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities  and assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation 
for all of these estimates  we caution that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition the majority of our revenue is recognized based on objective criteria and does not require significant estimates 
revenue from our fixed unit price contracts  time and materials contracts and cost plus contracts is recognized based on objective criteria and is not subject to estimates that may change over time 
however  for our fixed price contracts that use percentage of completion accounting  which is less than seven percent of the company s revenues  the determination of revenues and costs requires significant judgment and estimation 
under this method we recognize revenue on a constant margin as contract milestones or other output based measures are achieved 
costs are deferred until contractual milestones or other output based or cost based measures are achieved 
the method requires estimates of costs and profits over the entire term of the contract  including estimates of resources and costs necessary to complete performance 
such estimates are particularly difficult on activities involving state of the art technologies such as system development projects 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our software and systems engineers  program managers and financial professionals 
key factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract profitability include the availability and productivity of labor and the nature and complexity of the work to be performed 
a significant change in an estimate on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
our management regularly reviews project profitability and the underlying estimates 
modifications to contract scope  schedule  and price may be required on development contracts accounted for on a percentage of completion basis 
accounting for such changes prior to formal contract modification requires evaluation of the characteristics and circumstances of the effort completed and assessment of probability of recovery 
if recovery is deemed probable  we may  as appropriate  either defer the costs until the parties have agreed on the contract change or recognize the costs and related revenue as current period contract performance 
we routinely negotiate such contract modifications in both the us federal and global commercial segments 
many of our contracts call for us to provide a range of services or elements to our customers 
the total estimated revenue for these contracts is allocated to the various services or elements based on relative fair value 
these relative fair values are determined based on objective evidence of fair value 
once the total estimated revenue has been allocated to the various contract elements  revenue for each element is recognized based on the relevant revenue recognition method for the services performed or elements delivered 
estimates of total revenue at contract inception often differ materially from actual revenue due to volume difference  changes in technology or other factors which may not be foreseen at inception 
revenue recognition on software license sales that require significant customization if significant customization is required in the delivery of a proprietary software product  revenue is recognized as the software customization services are performed in accordance with the percentage of completion method described above 
thus  cost and profit estimates are required over the life of the project  and changes in such estimates can have a material effect on results 
capitalization of outsourcing contract costs certain costs incurred upon initiation of an outsourcing contract are deferred and amortized over the contract life 
these costs consist of contract acquisition and transition set up costs  and include the cost of due diligence activities after competitive selection  costs associated with installation of systems and processes  and amounts paid to clients in excess of the fair market value of acquired assets premiums 
finance staff  working with program management  review costs to determine appropriateness for deferral in accordance with relevant accounting guidance 
key estimates and assumptions that we must make include assessing the fair value of acquired assets in order to calculate the premium and projecting future cash flows in order to assess the recoverability of deferred costs 
we utilize the experience and knowledge of our professional staff in program management  operations  procurement and finance areas  as well as third parties on occasion  to determine fair values of assets acquired 
to assess recoverability  undiscounted estimated cash flows of the contract are projected over its remaining life and compared to the unamortized deferred cost balance 
such estimates require judgment and assumptions  which are based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our personnel 
key factors that are considered in estimating the undiscounted cash flows include projected labor costs and productivity efficiencies 
a significant change in an estimate or assumption on one or more contracts could have a material effect on our results of operations 
amortization of such premiums is recorded as a reduction to revenues 
capitalization of software development costs we capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products and to develop or purchase internal use software 
significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives  estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues  and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment 
for commercial software products  determining the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products 
we consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues  including an assessment of alternative solutions or products  current and historical demand for the product  and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete 
for internal use software  the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of our ability to utilize the software on an ongoing basis 
to assess the realizability or recoverability of capitalized software costs  we must estimate future revenue  costs and cash flows 
such estimates require assumptions about future cash inflows and outflows  and are based on the experience and knowledge of professional staff 
a significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations 
estimates used to determine income tax expense we make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities  which principally arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes 
we also must analyze income tax reserves  as well as determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets  and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly 
considerations with respect to the recoverability of deferred tax assets include the period of expiration of the tax asset  planned use of the tax asset  and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates 
valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors 
assumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill we account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting 
this method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired  including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer related intangibles  as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment 
liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition  and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value 
third party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities  but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us  such as forecasted revenues or profits on contract related intangibles 
numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments  which are conducted by company professionals from legal  finance  human resources  information systems  program management and other disciplines 
changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values  resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired 
as goodwill is not amortized  goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment 
such assessments require an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values 
cash flow projections are based on management approved estimates  which involve the input of numerous company professionals from finance  operations and program management 
key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts  estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs  and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates 
significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing can have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements 
assumptions to determine retirement benefits costs and liabilities we offer a number of pension and postretirement benefit and life insurance benefit plans 
csc utilizes actuarial methods required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended by sfas no 
for fiscal  employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  to account for pension and postretirement benefit plans  respectively 
the actuarial methods require numerous assumptions to calculate the net periodic pension benefit expense and the related pension benefit obligation for our defined benefit pension plans 
two of the most significant assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and discount rates 
in making these assumptions  we are required to consider current market conditions  including changes in interest rates 
changes in the related net periodic pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these and other assumptions 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns on pension plan assets 
the assumption for the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is selected by taking into account the expected duration of the projected benefit obligation for each plan  the asset mix of the plan  historic plan asset returns as well as current market conditions and other factors 
the weighted average of the expected long term rates of return  for all plans  on plan assets utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used in fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed rates of return on plan assets would have decreased or increased  respectively  the net periodic pension cost by approximately million 
an assumed discount rate is required to be used in each pension plan actuarial valuation 
the discount rate assumption reflects the market rate for high quality  fixed income debt instruments based on the expected duration of the benefit payments for each of our pension plans as of the annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
the weighted average of the discount rates utilized for the fiscal pension plan valuations was compared to used for fiscal holding all other assumptions constant  a one half percent increase or decrease in each of the assumed discount rates would have decreased the net periodic pension cost by approximately million  or increased it by approximately million  respectively 
some portion of the increase or decrease would be moderated by cost reimbursable contracts 
the accounting guidance includes mechanisms that serve to limit the volatility in earnings which would otherwise result from recording changes in the value of plan assets and benefit obligations in the consolidated financial statements in the periods in which such changes occur 
for example  while the expected long term rate of return on plan assets should  over time  approximate the actual long term returns  differences between the expected and actual returns may occur in any given year 
such differences contribute to the deferred actuarial gains or losses which are then amortized over time 
for csc  positive market returns for fiscal and fiscal caused actual pension plan asset returns to exceed those expected 
declining discount rates over the past several years  which resulted in higher calculated benefit obligations  served to partially offset or more than offset the positive impact of the asset returns for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
for fiscal  sfas no 
requires recognition of a pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the projected benefit obligation pbo at the end of the year 
for fiscal  sfas no 
requires recognition of a minimum pension obligation if the fair value of plan assets is less than the accumulated benefit obligation abo at the end of the year 
at the end of fiscal  a number of our pension plans had pbos in excess of the fair value of their respective plan assets  thus requiring the recognition of additional pension obligations 
the effect of this adjustment and the annual measurement was to increase pension liability by million  decrease intangible assets by million  decrease non current asset by million  and increase accumulated comprehensive loss by million million net of taxes 
based on future plan asset performance and interest rates  additional charges to equity might be required 
assumptions and estimates used to analyze contingencies and litigation we are subject to various claims and contingencies associated with lawsuits  insurance  tax and other issues arising out of the normal course of business 
the consolidated financial statements reflect the treatment of claims and contingencies based on management s view of the expected outcome 
csc consults with legal counsel on issues related to litigation and seeks input from other experts and advisors with respect to matters in the ordinary course of business 
if the likelihood of an adverse outcome is probable and the amount is estimable  we accrue a liability in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
significant changes in the estimates or assumptions used in assessing the likelihood of an adverse outcome could have a material effect on the consolidated financial results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates the company utilizes fixed rate long term debt obligations  short term commercial paper and other borrowings subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
sensitivity analysis is one technique used to measure the impact of changes in interest rates on the value of market risk sensitive financial instruments 
a hypothetical movement in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s future earnings or cash flows and fair value of fixed rate debt 
foreign currency during the ordinary course of business  the company enters into certain contracts denominated in foreign currency 
potential foreign currency exposures arising from these contracts are analyzed during the contract bidding process 
the company generally manages these transactions by incurring costs to service contracts in the same currency in which revenue is received 
short term contract financing requirements are met by borrowing in the same currency 
by generally matching revenues  costs and borrowings to the same currency  the company has been able to substantially mitigate foreign currency risk to earnings 
however  the company is increasing its use of offshore support and is therefore becoming more exposed to currency fluctuations 
the company may use foreign currency forward contracts or options to hedge exposures arising from these transactions 
during fiscal  of the company s revenue was generated outside of the united states 
using sensitivity analysis  a hypothetical increase in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would decrease revenue by or million  while a hypothetical decrease in the value of the us dollar against all currencies would increase revenue by or million 
in the opinion of management  a substantial portion of this fluctuation would be offset by expenses incurred in local currency 
as a result  a hypothetical movement of the value of the us dollar against all currencies in either direction would impact the company s earnings before interest and taxes by million 
this amount would be offset  in part  from the impacts of local income taxes and local currency interest expense 
at march   the company had approximately million of non us dollar denominated cash and cash equivalents  and approximately million of non us dollar borrowings
