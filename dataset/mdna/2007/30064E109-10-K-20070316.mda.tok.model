item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
orthopaedic products industry according to a research report published by knowledge enterprises  inc in december  the worldwide market for orthopaedic products in was estimated to be billion  which represented an increase of from the previous year 
according to this study  the primary three market segments in which exactech offers its products and services  reconstructive devices  orthobiologics and other products which includes instrumentation and other orthopaedic products  were estimated to be billion  billion and billion  respectively  during according to this report  bone and joint diseases account for half of all the chronic conditions in people over fifty years of age 
with the prediction of this population of people doubling by the year  the report suggests that demographics alone will drive growth in the global orthopaedic marketplace 
management shares the belief that the industry will continue to grow due to an aging population in much of the world 
increasing life spans impact the number of individuals with joints subject to failure  thereby increasing demand for joint replacement procedures 
products exactech s joint replacement products are used by orthopaedic surgeons to repair or replace joints that have deteriorated as a result of injury or disease 
reconstructive joint surgery involves the modification of the area surrounding the affected joint and the insertion of a set of manufactured implant components to replace or augment the joint 
during the surgery  the surgeon removes damaged cartilage and a portion of the bones that comprise the joint  prepares the remaining bone surfaces and surrounding tissue 
table of contents and then installs the implant 
when necessary  the surgeon uses biologic allograft materials  like those services distributed by exactech  to repair bone defects and provide an environment to stimulate new bone growth 
in many joint replacement procedures  acrylic bone cement is used to affix implant components to the prepared bone surfaces 
the following table includes the net revenue and percentage of net revenue for each of exactech s product lines for the years ended december   and sales by product line dollars in thousands year ended december  december  december  knee implants hip implants biologics other products total knee implants 
we believe that our optetrak knee system represents a major advance in knee implant design 
the optetrak knee system is a modular system designed to improve the movement of the knee cap  which is called patellar tracking  reduce the force between surfaces in a joint  also called articular contact stress that leads to implant failure  and provide a functional range of motion 
the optetrak system provides for a variety of femoral components  which relate to the thighbone  or femur  region  and includes a total primary knee replacement system which is available with either a cruciate ligament sparing femoral component in both cemented and porous coated designs and used in situations where the surgeon chooses to maintain certain ligaments or a posterior stabilized femoral component in both cemented and porous coated designs and used in situations where the surgeon chooses to eliminate certain ligaments 
the optetrak system also includes a constrained total knee system for revision surgery and primary surgery with severe deformities 
the constrained version includes two types of femoral components the constrained condylar modular femoral component and a constrained non modular femoral component 
the modular component includes stem and block augmentation to aid in repairing damaged or weakened bone 
the constrained condylar femoral component was designed to provide greater constraint between the tibial and femoral components of the system to compensate for ligaments weakened or lost due to disease or as a result of failure of previous treatments 
during  we began full scale marketing of an asymmetrical femoral component product line extension to the optetrak system 
this line extension also includes a cruciate sparing  posterior stabilized and a new high flexion component 
these asymmetrical line extensions provide for differentiated right and left femoral components to meet surgeon preferences 
during  we began clinical evaluation of a new unicondylar knee system  featuring exactech s new low profile instrumentation 
in  we launched a rotating bearing knee system for international markets 
in  we plan full market introduction of the optetrak uni complete with enhanced instrumentation along with updated versions of the low profile and ligament balancing instrument systems 
we continue to distribute link s line of implant products which includes the link endo model tm rotational knee  designed to provide stability with controlled rotation for severe joint deterioration with insufficient ligament support and the link endo model tm sled uni knee  designed for cases where only a portion of a joint warrants replacement 
hip implants 
exactech s line of hip implant and instrument products includes the acumatch integrated hip system which is designed to address the majority of requirements for total hip replacement  including primary and revision needs 
the system includes the c series cemented femoral stem  the a series acetabular components for the hip socket  the p series press fit femoral stem  the m series modular femoral stem  the l series femoral stem system  bipolar and unipolar partial hip replacement 
table of contents components  a variety of femoral heads and a cemented acetabular component 
the acumatch cemented revision components include revision long stems and calcar replacement stems that were originally part of the aura revision hip system 
exactech s acumatch c series cemented femoral stem is a forged cobalt chromium stem designed to improve stability and reduce dislocation complications by improving the head neck ratio and restoring anatomic offset for patients requiring cemented total hip arthroplasty  or joint reconstructive surgery 
the acumatch a series was designed to provide a comprehensive acetabular offering with sufficient polyethylene thickness to help lower stresses in the polyethylene liner 
the acumatch m series modular femoral stem offers components that are interchangeable  allowing the surgeon to customize the prosthesis at the time of surgery and according to the patient s bony structures 
this versatility and the manner in which the components mate can have a positive effect on patient outcomes 
the acumatch p series press fit femoral stem system has multiple coating options for fixation to bone and features a scientifically sound solution to stiffness mismatch and rotational instability in the bone  potential underlying causes of post operative residual thigh pain 
the acumatch l series hip system features both cemented and press fit femoral components  as well as unipolar and bipolar endoprostheses  often used for the treatment of hip fractures 
a low profile instrumentation system was launched during to support cases in which the surgeon may choose alternate incision lengths or less tissue disruption 
during  we introduced the press fit version of the new novation hip system as well as connexion gxl enhanced polyethelene for the acumatch a series acetabular system  which we believe made our hip offerings more competitive 
the novation hip system features both splined and cemented primary femoral stems  and will eventually offer a comprehensive acetabular system which is being designed to incorporate the use of enhanced polyethylene as well as alternative bearing couples such as ceramic on ceramic and diamond on diamond 
exactech submitted its ceramic on ceramic design for pma approval to the food and drug administration fda in the fourth quarter of  and is hoping to receive approval during exactech continues to develop the diamond on diamond technology in cooperation with dimicron  corporation 
the link hip implant product lines distributed by exactech include the mp tm modular femoral revision stem  offering surgeons a product specifically designed and required for situations where there is deficient proximal bone the top quarter of the femur 
this unique design offers enhanced stability and fatigue strength over and above competitive stems indicated for similar clinical situations 
also distributed by exactech is the link saddle prosthesis  a salvage type prosthesis designed to support the pelvic region when the acetabulum cannot be reconstructed  the link spii hip stem  and the link partial pelvis and the link betacone hip system  which allows for enhanced proximal load transfer  increased surface area for bony on growth and distal splines for additional rotational stability 
biologics exactech makes and distributes various products designed for the healing and regeneration of bone and wound tissue  including products which contain human allograft 
exactech has maintained a distribution relationship with regeneration technologies  inc rti since for the marketing of its opteform and optefil product lines of demineralized bone matrix 
during december  rti and exactech and rti and medtronic sofamor danek  inc modified their agreements providing for each organization to market the services for all musculoskeletal procedures 
prior to this modification  exactech s rights of distribution were limited to non spine applications for these products 
exactech also distributes regenaform and regenafil allograft tissue implants for usage in oral and dental applications 
in october  rti announced a voluntary recall of some of its allograft tissue implants due to questions raised with respect to donor documentation on donated tissues received from an unaffiliated donor recovery organization 
this recall affected some of the allograft tissue services distributed by exactech 
the ultimate effect of this recall on exactech s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows is uncertain 
in  exactech commenced marketing of optemx a tri calcium phosphate hydroxyapatite based synthetic bone graft extender licensed under a non exclusive us distribution agreement with 
table of contents biomatlante 
additionally  the company launched a new platform of demineralized bone matrix products  under the brand name optecure tm 
this product was the first product containing human tissue to receive clearance as a medical device from the fda 
the product also contains a synthetic bioabsorbable polymer carrier material licensed from genzyme corp 
in  exactech intends to release line extensions of the material 
in late  exactech completed a clinical evaluation of the accelerate tm platelet concentration system 
accelerate will be introduced in early as a means of extracting autologous growth factors and fibrinogen from patients own blood to improve the healing quality of joints and tissue following orthopaedic procedures 
other products 
the acudriver automated osteotome system is an air driven impact hand piece that assists surgeons during joint implant revision procedures by aiding in effective removal of failed prostheses and bone cement 
the acudriver accomplishes this by providing the surgeon with precise positioning without the inconvenience and inconsistency of striking the osteotome with a mallet 
exactech also distributes link surgical instrumentation that can be used in various orthopaedic procedures including shoulder  knee  spine  foot  ankle and hip arthroplasty 
the cemex bone cement system features a unique self contained delivery system that has been clinically proven in europe for more than a decade 
by integrating bone cement powder and liquid into a sealed mixing system  cemex is designed to offer surgeons and operating room personnel simplicity  safety and reliability in bone cement 
exactech distributes cemex in the united states under an exclusive distribution agreement with the italian manufacturer  tecres spa in june  exactech gained fda clearance and began marketing cemex genta  a bone cement containing antibiotics 
in exactech announced that tecres had received clearance from the fda to market pre formed cement hip and knee spacer products containing an antibiotic that is included in our distribution agreement 
the interspace tm hip  knee  and shoulder spacers are used in two stage revision procedures that involve an infection with a previously implanted prosthesis and provide orthopaedic surgeons with a new  convenient way to treat this difficult problem 
we began marketing the spacers in in exactech announced that tecres had received clearance from the fda to market a pre formed cement shoulder spacer product containing an antibiotic that is included in our distribution agreement 
in november  we received fda clearance for marketing the equinoxe primary and fracture shoulder systems in the united states 
the equinoxe systems were developed from a patented total shoulder system acquired from teknimed  sa  a french manufacturer of orthopaedic implants and processor of biological products 
during  we commenced full scale marketing of the primary and fracture systems 
during  we intend to release a reverse application version of the equinoxe system 
we received fda clearance to market our equinoxe reverse shoulder late in the first quarter of  and intend to begin a limited release to our team of clinical evaluators in the second quarter of with the full market release coming in the second half of marketing and sales exactech markets its orthopaedic implant products in the united states through a network of independent sales agencies  direct sales representatives and domestic distributors 
these organizations  along with their independently contracted personnel  serve as the company s sales representatives 
internationally  exactech markets its products through a network of independent distributors and wholly owned subsidiaries that currently distribute products and services in over twenty five countries 
the customers for exactech s products are hospitals  surgeons and other physicians and clinics 
exactech generally has contractual arrangements with its independent sales organizations whereby they are granted the exclusive right to sell the company s products in the specified territory 
in turn  the sales organizations are required to meet sales quotas to maintain their relationships with exactech 
we typically pay our sales agencies a commission based on net sales 
exactech is highly dependent on the 
table of contents expertise and customer relationships of its sales agencies 
exactech s sales organization is managed by regional directors of sales assigned to regions throughout the united states 
we have contractual arrangements with our domestic distributors that are similar to our arrangements with our sales agencies  except we do not pay the distributors commissions and the distributors purchase inventory from the company for use in fulfilling customer orders 
exactech currently offers its products in all fifty states  and the district of columbia 
exactech provides inventories of its products to its united states sales organizations until sold or returned 
these inventories are necessary for sales representatives to market the company s products and fill customer orders 
the size of the component to be used for a specific patient is typically not known with certainty until the time of surgery 
due to this uncertainty  a minimum of one of each size of each component in the system to be used must be available to each sales representative at the time of surgery 
accordingly  exactech is required to maintain substantial levels of inventory 
the maintenance of relatively high levels of inventory requires us to incur significant expenditures of our resources 
the failure by exactech to maintain required levels of inventory could have a material adverse effect on the company s expansion 
as a result of the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory  exactech is subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence 
in the event that a substantial portion of the company s inventory becomes obsolete  it would have a material adverse effect on the company 
we review our inventory for obsolescence on a regular basis and adjust our inventory for impairment 
during each of the years ended december   and  approximately of our sales were derived from a major hospital customer 
during   and  one international distributor accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of exactech s total sales 
exactech generally has contractual arrangements with its international distributors pursuant to which the distributor is granted the exclusive right to market our products in the specified territory and the distributor is required to meet sales quotas to maintain its relationship with us 
international distributors typically purchase product inventory and instruments from us for their use in marketing and filling customer orders 
exactech operates wholly owned subsidiary operations in china and the united kingdom  and a branch office in canada 
for the years ended december   and  international sales accounted for   and  respectively  representing approximately  and  respectively  of exactech s net sales 
of those international sales  sales to our spanish distributor accounted for   and  in  and  respectively 
we intend to continue to expand our sales in international markets in which there is increasing demand for orthopaedic implant products 
manufacturing and supply early in our history  we utilized third party vendors for the manufacture of all of our component parts  while internally performing product design  quality assurance and packaging 
at present  we manufacture approximately of our implant components in our manufacturing facility and headquarters in gainesville  florida 
we have continued to increase the number of internally manufactured components 
with the increase of internal manufacturing  we have experienced a greater degree of control of production costs  and we expect this trend to continue 
exactech continually assesses the manufacturing capabilities and cost effectiveness of our existing and potential vendors in an attempt to secure our supply chain and decrease dependency on key suppliers 
for the years ended december   and  we purchased approximately  and  respectively  of our externally sourced component requirements from our top three suppliers 
we typically do not maintain supply contracts with most of our manufacturers  and purchase components pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time in the ordinary course of business 
during the first half of  we experienced challenges with our supply chain that adversely impacted our ability to meet complete demand for some of our new and existing hip and knee implant products  however  we believe we have made significant progress in working with our suppliers to resolve those issues  both in the short and long term 
exactech has 
table of contents continued to develop alternative sources for components 
while we do not anticipate that we will encounter problems in obtaining adequate supplies of components  we cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be able to obtain components under acceptable terms and in a timely manner 
certain tooling and equipment unique to exactech s products are provided by us to our suppliers 
order backlog is not a material aspect of our business 
exactech s internal manufacturing  assembly  packaging and quality control operations are conducted at our principal offices in gainesville  florida 
components received from suppliers  as well as those internally manufactured  are examined by exactech personnel prior to assembly or packaging to ensure that our specifications and standards are maintained 
patents and proprietary technology  license and consulting agreements exactech holds united states and international patents covering several of our implant components  biologic materials technologies and some of our surgical instrumentation 
we believe that patents and intellectual property will continue to be important in the orthopaedic industry 
in this regard  we defend our intellectual property rights and believe that our patents and products do not and will not infringe patents or violate proprietary rights of others  although it is possible that our existing patent rights may not be valid or that infringement of existing or future patents or proprietary rights may occur 
in the event some of exactech s intellectual property and agreements relating to our products are deemed invalid  such action could have a material adverse effect on exactech s financial condition and results of operations 
in connection with the development of our knee implant systems  exactech pays royalties to dr 
william petty and dr 
gary miller  who are executive officers and principal shareholders of the company 
dr 
petty also serves as chairman of the company s board of directors 
new employment agreements entered into between exactech and each of drs 
petty and miller on january  provide for the continuation of the royalty payments in addition to their regular compensation as executive officers 
compensation associated with these agreements is the only compensation paid by exactech to drs 
petty and miller 
exactech also pays royalties to a significant hospital customer  pursuant to a license agreement we entered into for their assistance in the development  training  and promotion of our knee implant systems 
exactech has entered into a verbal consulting agreement with albert burstein  phd  a director of the company  to provide services regarding many facets of the orthopaedic industry including product design rationale  manufacturing and development techniques and product sales and marketing 
during  exactech paid dr 
burstein  as compensation under this consulting agreement 
research and development during  and  exactech expended   and  respectively  on research and development and anticipates that research and development expenses will continue to increase 
exactech s research and development efforts contributed to the successful release of the novation hip stem systems  line extensions of the optetrak knee system and design improvements targeted to improving internal manufacturing efficiency 
exactech s research and development efforts continue to focus on implant product line extensions  advanced biologic materials  extremity joint reconstruction and alternative bearing surfaces 
as an important part of our research and development efforts  we have developed strategic partnerships through agreements with genzyme biosurgery corporation and dimicron corporation to bring expertise in advanced materials to exactech s products 
the agreement with genzyme is for the development of polymer based synthetic biomaterials  that when delivered with other biologic products support the growth of new bone 
through our agreement with dimicron  we intend to apply dimicron s polycrystalline diamond compact  or pdc  technology to our hip implants 
this diamond technology holds the promise of 
table of contents improved mechanical and wear characteristics over currently available technology 
this technology will likely require a number of years of development and regulatory clearance prior to the release of products for sale 
exactech believes that the purchase of intellectual property and product line assets augmented by additional development provides a cost effective and efficient way to bring products to market and expects to continue to do so in the future to complement its internal product development 
competition the orthopaedic device industry is highly competitive and dominated by a number of large companies with substantially greater financial and other resources than exactech 
the largest competitors in the orthopaedic device market are depuy  inc  a division of johnson and johnson  zimmer  inc  a subsidiary of zimmer holdings  inc  stryker howmedica osteonics  a subsidiary of stryker corp  smith and nephew plc  and biomet orthopaedics  a subsidiary of biomet  inc according to the worldwide orthopedic market by knowledge enterprises  inc  these five companies had an estimated aggregate market share of approximately in companies in the industry compete on the basis of product features and design  innovation  service  the ability to maintain new product flow  relationships with key orthopaedic surgeons and hospitals  the strength of their distribution network and price 
while price is a key factor in the orthopaedic market  there are other significant factors  including surgeon preference  ease of use  clinical results  and service provided by the company and its representatives 
product liability and insurance exactech is subject to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design  marketing and sale of orthopaedic implants and surgical instrumentation 
we have implemented strict quality control measures and currently maintain product liability insurance in amounts that we believe are typical in the industry for similar companies 
during through  we experienced stable insurance premiums as a percentage of sales 
we evaluate annually our levels of product liability insurance  as well as the amount of retention carried compared to other companies in the industry 
due to the volatility of the insurance marketplace  the value of the product liability insurance products delivered and the small number of providers of these products  there can be no guarantees as to whether we will be able to secure such coverage in the future at a cost deemed to be appropriate 
government regulation exactech is subject to government regulation in the united states and other countries in which it conducts business 
for some products  and in some areas of the world  government regulation is significant  and there appears to be a general trend toward more stringent regulation throughout the world 
governmental regulatory actions can result in  among other things  warning letters  fines  injunctions  civil penalties  recalls or seizures of product  total or partial suspensions of production  refusals to grant future pre market clearances or approvals  withdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals  and criminal prosecution 
it is exactech s practice to comply with all regulatory requirements governing its products and operations and to conduct its affairs in an ethical manner 
exactech devotes significant time  effort and expense addressing the extensive government and regulatory requirements applicable to its business and believes that it is no more or less adversely affected by existing government regulations than are its competitors 
the primary regulatory authority in the united states is the fda 
the development  testing  marketing and manufacturing of medical devices  including reconstructive devices  are regulated under the medical device amendments of to the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  the safe medical devices act of  the fda modernization act of  the medical device user fee and modernization act of and additional regulations promulgated by the fda and various other federal  state and local agencies 

table of contents in general  these statutes and regulations require that manufacturers adhere to certain standards designed to ensure the safety and effectiveness of medical devices 
the fda is authorized to obtain and inspect devices  their labeling and advertising  and the facilities in which they are manufactured 
exactech is registered with the fda and believes that it is in substantial compliance with all applicable material governmental regulations 
exactech believes it is well positioned to face the changing international regulatory environment 
the international standards organization  or iso  has an internationally recognized set of standards aimed at ensuring the design and manufacture of quality products 
exactech has successfully participated in iso audits and obtained iso registration 
the european union requires that medical devices bear a ce mark 
the ce mark is an international symbol  which indicates that the product adheres to european medical device directives 
each of exactech s medical devices sold in europe bears the ce mark 
exactech is subject to federal anti kickback laws and regulations 
these laws and regulations prohibit any knowing and willful offer  payment  solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration  either directly or indirectly  in return for  or to induce referral of an individual for a service or product for which payment may be made by medicare  medicaid or another government sponsored health care program  or purchasing  leasing  ordering or arranging for  or recommending the purchase  lease or order of  any service or product for which payment may be made by a government sponsored health care program 
violation of these laws is a felony  punishable by fines up to  per violation and imprisonment for up to five years 
civil penalties may also be imposed which exclude violators from participation in medicare or state health programs 
regulators may challenge or review exactech s current or future activities under these laws which would be costly and time consuming and could reduce cash flows and revenues 
significant prohibitions against physician referrals were enacted by congress in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of these laws prohibit  subject to specified exemptions  a physician or a member of his immediate family from referring medicare or medicaid patients to an entity providing designated health services in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest  or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement 
the penalties for violating these laws include a prohibition on payment by these government programs and civil penalties of as much as  for each violative referral and  for participation in a circumvention scheme 
the violation of these laws by the company could result in significant fines or penalties and exclusion from participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
while exactech is unable to predict the extent to which its business may be affected by future regulatory developments  it believes that its substantial experience in dealing with governmental regulatory requirements and restrictions throughout the world should enable it to continue to compete effectively within this increasingly regulated environment 
environmental law compliance exactech s operations are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning  among other things  the generation  handling  storage  transportation  treatment and disposal of toxic and hazardous substances and the discharge of pollutants into the air and water 
environmental permits and controls are required for some of exactech s manufacturing operations and these permits are subject to modification  renewal and revocation by the issuing authorities 
exactech does not have underground storage tanks and believes that its facilities are in substantial compliance with its permits and environmental laws and regulations and does not believe that future environmental compliance will have a material adverse effect on its business  financial condition or results of operations 
exactech s environmental capital expenditures and costs for environmental compliance may increase in the future as a result of changes in environmental laws and regulations or as a result of increased manufacturing activities at its facilities 
exactech could be materially adversely affected by any failure to comply with environmental laws  including the costs of undertaking a clean up at a site to which its wastes were transported

item a 
risk factors although it is not possible to predict or identify all risk factors inherent in exactech s business  they may include those listed below  which should not be considered an exhaustive statement of all potential risks and uncertainties exactech is subject to extensive government regulation 
failure to obtain government approvals and clearances for new products and or modifications to existing products on a timely basis would likely have a material adverse effect on the business and financial results of exactech 
a significant recall of one or more of exactech s products could have a material adverse effect on exactech s business and financial results 
exactech cannot provide assurance that such clearances will be granted or that review by government authorities will not involve delays that could materially adversely affect exactech s revenues and earnings 
exactech expects the healthcare industry to face increased scrutiny over reimbursement and healthcare reform  which could adversely impact how much or under what circumstances healthcare providers will prescribe or administer exactech s products 
in both the united states and other countries  sales of exactech s products will depend in part upon the availability of 
table of contents reimbursement from third party payers  which include government health administration authorities  managed care providers  and private health insurers 
third party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the cost effectiveness of medical products and services 
increasing expenditures for healthcare have been the subject of considerable public attention in the united states 
both private and government entities are seeking ways to reduce or contain healthcare costs 
numerous proposals that would effect changes in the united states healthcare system have been introduced or proposed in congress and in some state legislatures 
although we cannot predict the full effect on our business of the implementation of this legislation  we believe that legislation that reduces reimbursement for our products could adversely impact sales 
this could materially and adversely impact our business by reducing our ability to generate revenue  raise capital  obtain additional collaborators and market our products 
exactech is required to incur significant expenditures of resources in order to maintain relatively high levels of inventory 
as a result of the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory  exactech is subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence 
in the event that a substantial portion of the company s inventory becomes obsolete  it could have a material adverse effect on exactech s earnings due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges 
exactech relies upon third party suppliers for its raw materials and supplies 
should the availability and on time delivery of raw materials and supplies needed in the production of its products and services become unreliable or the costs of such increases significantly  it could have a material adverse effect on exactech s earnings due to the resulting increased costs of production 
exactech conducts business in a highly competitive industry 
the orthopaedic implant industry is subject to competition in the following areas product features and design  innovation  service  the ability to maintain new product flow  relationships with key orthopaedic surgeons and hospitals  strength of distribution network  and price 
in addition  exactech faces competition for regional sales representatives within the medical community 
exactech cannot provide assurance that it will be able to compete successfully 
exactech s success is partially dependent upon its ability to successfully market new and improved products and the market acceptance of those products 
the failure of its products to gain market acceptance would be likely to have a material adverse effect on its revenues and earnings 
exactech cannot provide assurance that new or improved products will gain market acceptance 
exactech s sales revenues are partially derived from the distribution of third party manufacturer s products 
should we fail to meet the minimum sales performance or purchases commitments common to such third party manufacturer distribution agreements  those third parties may elect to discontinue exactech s distribution of their products and services 
should exactech lose the rights to one or more of its distribution agreements  it could have a material adverse effect on its revenues and earnings 
exactech is subject to federal anti kickback laws and regulations 
there are extensive federal and state laws and regulations prohibiting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry that can result in significant criminal and civil penalties 
these federal laws include the anti kickback statute  which prohibits certain business practices and relationships  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be paid by medicare or other federal healthcare programs  the physician self referral prohibition  commonly referred to as the stark law  the anti inducement law  which prohibits providers from offering anything to a medicare or medicaid beneficiary to induce that beneficiary to use items or services covered by either program  the false claims act  which prohibits any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented false or fraudulent claims for payment by the federal government  including the medicare and medicaid programs  and  the civil monetary penalties law  which authorizes the united states department of health and human services to impose civil penalties administratively for fraudulent or abusive acts 
sanctions for violating these federal laws include criminal and civil penalties that range from punitive sanctions  damage assessments  money penalties  imprisonment  denial of medicare and medicaid payments  or exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs  or both 
as federal and state budget pressures continue  federal and state administrative agencies may also continue to escalate investigation and enforcement 
table of contents efforts to root out waste and to control fraud and abuse in governmental healthcare programs 
private enforcement of healthcare fraud has also increased  due in large part to amendments to the civil false claims act in that were designed to encourage private persons to sue on behalf of the government

we assume relatively stable interest rates  full payment of our debt instruments by due dates  and no additional lending other than under our line of credit 
this estimate is subject to uncertainty due to the variable nature of the interest rates and revolving nature of our line of credit 
should interest rates vary significantly  our estimate could be materially different from actual results 
at december   we did not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or any unconsolidated  special purpose entities 
during january  we entered into a contract to purchase a  square foot building on approximately one acre of land adjacent to the leased distribution facility in gainesville  florida  for  the acquisition of this new facility is anticipated to close during the first quarter of 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations is based on exactech and our subsidiaries financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
exactech s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in management s opinion  exactech s critical accounting policies include allowance for doubtful accounts  excess and obsolete inventories  intangible assets  subsidiary consolidation  accrued liabilities  and provision for income taxes 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns exactech s accounts receivable consists primarily of amounts due from hospitals 
amounts due from international distributors carry longer payment terms than domestic customers  typically due in days 
we typically perform credit evaluations on our customers and generally do not require collateral 
exactech invoices sales to international distributors in us dollars and is not subject to currency exchange rate risk on accounts receivable 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to estimate the losses due to the inability to collect required payment from our customers for products and services rendered 
in calculating the allowance  we utilize a model that ages the accounts receivable and applies a progressively higher allowance percentage to each tier of receivables past due terms 
should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required which would affect exactech s future operating results due to increased expenses for the resulting uncollectible bad debt 
we grant sales returns on a case by case basis 
we calculate an allowance for returns based upon an analysis of our historical sales turn experience 
at december   our allowance for sales returns was  we did not record any sales return allowance during  due to the amount being insignificant 
excess and obsolete inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market and include implants consigned to customers and agents 
exactech provides significant loaned implant inventory to non distributor customers 
impairment charges for obsolete and slow moving inventories are recorded based upon an analysis of specific identification of obsolete inventory items and quantification of slow moving inventory items 
for slow moving inventory  this analysis compares the quantity of inventory on hand to the projected sales of such inventory items 
as a result of this analysis  we record an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of any impaired inventory to its fair value  which becomes its new cost basis 
impairment charges for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
if the actual product life cycles  demand or general market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory impairment charges may be required which would affect future operating results due to increased costs from the resulting adjustment 
inventory is also reviewed for the ability to turn over the inventory within the following year  and total inventory that is not projected to be sold during the following twelve month period based on projected cost of goods sold is classified as a non current asset on the consolidated balance sheets 
during  we experienced an increase in total inventory of million in support of the company s continuing development efforts to expand product lines to protect against supply chain delays that were experienced during the first half of this was achieved by certain management actions including adding alternative sources of supply  increasing orders and increasing inventory related to internal manufacturing capabilities 
subsequent to the issuance of the company s financial statements  the company determined that  of inventory previously included in current assets as of december   should have been classified as non current assets based on expected inventory turns 
as a result  the consolidated balance sheet as of december  has been restated to reduce current inventory  current deferred tax assets  current assets  and long term deferred tax liabilities by    and  respectively from amounts previously reported to properly present non current inventory 
as of december  and  we had  and  of inventory recorded as a non current asset  respectively 
we 
table of contents believe that the reduction in non current inventory will continue as total inventory levels remain stable while sales and related cost of goods sold are expected to grow 
intangible assets in assessing the value of our intangible assets  we must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows  economic life and other factors to determine fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record an impairment charge for these assets in accordance with sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
exactech analyzes its intangible assets for impairment issues on a quarterly and annual basis 
subsidiary consolidation in accordance with the provisions of fin r consolidation of variable interest entities an interpretation of arb no 
 exactech evaluates its equity investments on a quarterly basis to determine the necessity to consolidate the investment as a subsidiary of the company 
our wholly owned subsidiaries  exactech asia and exactech uk  ltd 
are fully consolidated after all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated 
accrued liabilities exactech is subject to various claims  lawsuits  disputes with third parties and actions involving various allegations against exactech incident to the operation of its business  principally product liability claims 
exactech accrues liabilities for such claims that are deemed to be probable and reasonably estimable  as required by sfas accounting for contingencies  based upon exactech s experience with similar past claims  advice of counsel and the best information available 
if one or both of these criteria are not met  exactech discloses the loss contingency if it is reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred  in accordance with sfas should the outcome of any pending  threatened  or future litigation have an outcome unfavorable to exactech  it may affect future operating results due to the resulting increases in operating expenses associated with such litigation 
provision for income taxes management must use estimates and professional judgment in calculating the provision for income taxes in determining the deductibility and technical merit of the positions taken on the company s tax returns 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 effective beginning january   management will evaluate its tax positions to determine if they are more likely than not to be sustained upon examination  and measure the benefit to be recognized in the financial statements 
should any of our tax positions be determined to be uncertain  it may result in an increase in current and or future taxes due
