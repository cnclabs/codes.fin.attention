table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in  we generated higher revenues  profits and cash flows than our company has ever experienced 
this resulted mainly because of the significant acquisitions that we made in  along with a healthy business environment for our products 
we completed four acquisitions in  with emj and yarde metals being the most significant  adding billion to our consolidated sales 
emj and yarde significantly transformed our company in terms of size  geographic spread and product diversification 
we now have a much larger position in the midwest region of the united states and we have meaningful exposure to the new england and canadian markets  primarily in specialty products 
we also increased our exposure to the energy  oil and gas industry with our acquisition of emj 
we have already completed the acquisition of three metals service center companies in that had combined revenues of approximately million 
we continue to focus on growing our company with accretive acquisitions that enhance our product  geographic and customer diversity 
in we also spent million on capital expenditures that supported our organic growth  including the expansion of our existing facilities and penetration of new markets 
strong business conditions created some unique opportunities for us in to support our growth  we also completed important financing transactions in this included a tender offer to purchase approximately million of senior secured notes issued by emj  replacing our million credit facility with a new five year  unsecured billion syndicated credit facility  and issuing million of senior unsecured notes with million of ten year notes at and million of thirty year notes at 
these activities lowered our cost of capital and significantly increased our ability to fund our existing operations and provide for future growth 
demand for most products that we sell was strong throughout  most significantly for products that we sell to the non residential construction  aerospace and energy markets 
pricing was also strong for most products that we sell 
carbon steel products have been at relatively high levels since although pricing declined somewhat in the fourth quarter of from earlier in the year due to increased imports and inventory destocking at the distributor level  we expect this to have only a temporary impact on pricing 
carbon steel prices are not at the record levels experienced in  however  fluctuations in pricing have moderated at these higher levels 
pricing for aluminum products was steady to up slightly in  at high levels compared to historical prices  especially for aerospace products 
stainless steel prices reached unprecedented levels in and have continued to rise in this is primarily due to a global shortage of nickel resulting from mine closures 
we expect stainless steel prices to decline from current levels but we are uncertain as to the timing or severity of the declines 
because of the overall healthy demand in  we were typically able to increase our selling prices for most products at a rate equal to or above our cost increases 
however  pressures on carbon steel pricing during the fourth quarter of the year resulted in reduced gross profit margins for these products during that time 
we are proud of our record financial results 
in addition to profitability  we focus on working capital management which allows us to generate cash flow to further expand and strengthen our business and reduce debt during most environments 
our cash flow from operations was very strong  reflecting the quality of our earnings 
we completed four acquisitions in  grew our existing operations  and continued to evaluate opportunities that would allow us to improve our profitability 
we believe the steps that we took during the difficult years of through positioned us to take full advantage of the improved economic conditions we have experienced since however  as evidenced by our performance during the difficult years  we take the necessary actions to allow us to operate efficiently and profitably even in less favorable economies 
we believe this is because of our focus on cost controls and inventory turnover and our product  customer and geographic diversification 
our product and geographic diversification should continue to benefit us in we are optimistic about business conditions in significant declines in demand or pricing for our products  although not expected  could reduce our gross profit margins 
also  if we cannot obtain a sufficient supply of metals for our customers in  or if domestic availability of our products increases significantly in  this could negatively impact our financial results  especially as compared to our results 
customer demand can have a significant impact on our results of operations 
when volume increases  our revenue dollars increase  which contributes to increased gross profit dollars 
variable costs may also increase with volume including increases in 
table of contents our warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses 
conversely  when volume declines  we typically produce fewer revenue dollars which can reduce our gross profit dollars 
we can reduce certain variable expenses when volumes decline  but we cannot easily reduce our fixed costs 
pricing for our products can have a more significant impact on our results of operations than customer demand levels 
as pricing increases  so do our revenue dollars 
our pricing usually increases when the cost of our materials increases 
if prices increase and we maintain the same gross profit percentage  we generate higher levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
conversely  if pricing declines  we will typically generate lower levels of gross profit and pre tax income dollars 
because changes in pricing do not require us to adjust our expense structure  the impact on our results of operations is much greater than the effect of volume changes 
also  when volume or pricing increases  our working capital requirements typically increase  which may require us to increase our outstanding debt 
this could increase our interest expense 
when our customer demand falls  we can typically generate strong levels of cash flow from operations as our working capital needs decrease

results of operations the following table sets forth certain income statement data for each of the three years in the period ended december  dollars are shown in thousands and certain amounts may not calculate due to rounding of of of net sales net sales net sales net sales gross profit s  g a expenses depreciation expense operating profit excludes other income  amortization expense  minority interest  interest expense and income tax expense 

table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales were a record billion  an increase of  compared to billion in our acquisitions of emj and yarde metals in contributed significantly to our increased sales levels 
our sales include an increase in our tons sold of and an increase in our average selling price per ton sold of the tons sold and average selling price per ton sold exclude amounts related to precision strip 
same store sales  which exclude the sales of our and acquisitions  were billion in  up from  with a increase in our tons sold and a increase in our average selling price per ton sold 
our tons sold increased significantly because of our acquisitions but also increased on a same store basis due to strong demand throughout the year in most end markets that we sell to 
our average selling price per ton sold was up because of a shift to a greater percentage of higher value products due to our acquisitions and because of increased pricing for most products that we sell compared to levels  especially for stainless steel products 
the acquisitions of emj and yarde metals significantly increased our stainless steel exposure with sales of stainless and alloy steel products representing of our sales  compared to of our sales 
gross profit 
our total gross profit of billion  up from  increased mainly because of our higher net sales level in our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  down from in in our gross profit margins declined somewhat due to our acquisitions and because of competitive pressure on sales of carbon steel products late in the year 
our same store gross profit margin was 
also  our lifo expense was significantly higher than in we recorded lifo expense  which is included in our cost of sales  of million during  compared to million in our lifo expense in resulted mainly from the increased costs of stainless steel and aluminum products and higher quantities of inventory on hand at year end compared to the beginning of the year because of improved demand levels for most products 
expenses 
warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a expenses for increased million  or from mainly due to our and acquisitions and additional selling expenses from our increased sales levels 
the expenses as a percent of sales in were compared to in the period 
the decrease in our s  g a expenses as a percentage of sales was due mainly to our increased sales and effective expense control 
depreciation expense increased million in mainly because of our and acquisitions and because of depreciation of our capital expenditures 
our amortization expense increased million in mainly because of our acquisitions 
operating profit 
operating profit  calculated as gross profit less s  g a expenses and depreciation expense  was million in  resulting in an operating profit margin of  compared to operating profit of million and an operating profit margin of 
the increased profit is mainly due to higher gross profit dollars resulting from increased sales levels  along with our effective expense control 
other income and expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the increase was mainly due to increased borrowings to fund our acquisitions 
minority interest expense decreased in compared to mainly due to our purchase of the remaining minority interest in american steel  llc effective january   we own of american steel 
because of this change in ownership  we no longer record minority interest expense for american steel 
our minority interest expense consists of the net income for the approximately of valex corp 
and the of valex korea that we do not own  and also for the of everest metals that we do not own 
income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in  down from in  mainly due to slightly higher international profits that are taxed at lower rates and tax benefits carried over from emj 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
our consolidated net sales were billion  an increase of  compared to billion in this increase includes the additional sales from chapel steel of million that we acquired in july our increased sales include an increase in our tons sold of and an increase in our average selling price per ton sold of 
same store sales  which exclude the sales of chapel steel  were billion in  up from  with a decrease in our tons sold and a increase in our average selling price per ton sold 

table of contents our volume increased due to the added sales of chapel steel  however  on a same store basis  our volume was down from mainly because of the heavy buying that occurred in when our customers were trying to build inventory ahead of the significant carbon steel price increases 
because carbon steel prices were declining for most of  our customers were not building inventory until late in the third quarter 
we experienced demand improvement beginning late in the third quarter that continued throughout the fourth quarter 
this was due to improved end markets for most products we sell  with non residential construction and aerospace being significant contributors to the strong end market demand 
our average selling price per ton sold was higher in than in mainly because of increased costs for most products that we sell and due to a small shift in product mix to a higher percentage of aluminum and stainless steel products as compared to although carbon steel costs declined during the first eight months of  the average cost for the full year remained above the average 
aluminum and stainless steel costs began increasing in and continued to increase throughout  with significant and rapid increases in the costs of aerospace products 
the improved demand for aerospace products resulted in a slight shift in product mix to higher priced products that contributed to our increased average selling prices in gross profit 
our total gross profit of million  up from  increased mainly because of our higher net sales amount in our gross profit as a percentage of sales was in  down from in in our gross profit margins declined mainly because of the pressure on our selling prices for carbon steel products resulting from lower costs  especially compared to when we experienced high profitability levels for these products because of limited availability and significant cost increases 
gross profit margins for aerospace related products were higher in because we were able to increase our selling prices ahead of our costs 
the acquisition of chapel steel lowered our gross profit margin somewhat  as its business is more of a wholesale distribution business that operates at a lower gross profit margin than our consolidated average 
our same store gross profit margin was 
also  our lifo expense was significantly lower than in primarily due to decreases in carbon steel costs  with the impact somewhat offset by the rising costs of aerospace products 
we recorded lifo expense of million during  compared to million in most of our lifo expense was due to increased costs for aerospace related aluminum  titanium  and stainless steel products 
expenses 
s  g a expenses for increased million  or from the expenses as a percent of sales in were compared to in the period 
the dollar increase in s  g a expenses was mostly because chapel steel was included beginning in the third quarter  as well as general cost increases 
the decrease in our s  g a expenses as a percentage of sales was due mainly to our increased sales levels and because chapel steel s s  g a expenses are lower than the company s average as a percentage of sales 
depreciation expense increased million in because of the additional expense from chapel steel and expense on our fixed asset additions 
amortization expense increased million in primarily due to the write off of financing costs related to our million syndicated credit facility that we replaced in june of and because of the amortization expense from chapel steel 
operating profit 
operating profit was million in  resulting in an operating profit margin of  compared to operating profit of million and an operating profit margin of 
the improvement resulted from our higher sales levels that provided increased operating profit dollars in  along with our healthy gross profit margins and lower s  g a expenses as a percentage of sales  as discussed above 
other income and expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease was mainly due to lower borrowing levels because of the increased cash flow from operations that we generated in our interest expense includes interest on our borrowings of approximately million to fund the acquisition of chapel steel on july   which we had fully repaid as of december  minority interest expense decreased in compared to mainly because we purchased the remaining interest in valex korea from our partner in july the minority interest expense represents the net income attributed to the of american steel  llc that we did not own 
income tax rate 
our effective income tax rate was in  up from in  mainly due to an increase in our state rate because of shifts in the geographic composition of our income  resulting mainly from our acquisition of chapel steel and the increased profitability from our locations that serve the aerospace market 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources at december   our working capital was billion  up from million at december  the overall increase was primarily from the additional working capital of emj and yarde metals 
excluding the initial effect of acquisitions  the increase in working capital is mainly due to an increase in our accounts receivable of million and an increase in our inventory of million  resulting from improved demand and pricing that we experienced for most of our products in as compared to to manage our working capital  we focus on our days sales outstanding to monitor accounts receivable and on our inventory turnover rate to monitor our inventory levels  as receivables and inventory are our two most significant elements of working capital 
as of december   our days sales outstanding were approximately days  up slightly from our december  rate of days 
we calculate our days sales outstanding as an average of the most recent two month period 
our inventory turn rate at december  was about times or months on hand  down from times during  but still at a level well above the industry average of months on hand 
our inventory turn rate was negatively impacted by our acquisitions of emj and yarde metals because they carry many products that do not typically turn at rates as high as many of our other products 
although we do not expect emj and yarde metals to turn their inventory at the same rate as most of our other businesses  we do expect improvement from current levels 
excluding the effect of emj and yarde metals  our inventory turn for was times 
as demand and pricing for our products increase or decrease  our working capital needs increase or decrease  respectively 
we expect to finance increases in our working capital needs through operating cash flow or with borrowings on our syndicated credit facility 
our primary sources of liquidity are generally from internally generated funds from operations and our revolving line of credit 
cash flow provided by operations decreased to million in compared to million in although our cash flow from operations was strong  it was down from primarily due to the additional working capital requirements in that resulted from increased demand and pricing 
our outstanding debt including capital lease obligations at december  was billion  up from million at year end  mainly due to the financing of our acquisitions 
at december   we had million borrowed on our billion revolving line of credit  which includes million to pay off private placement notes that matured 
our net debt to total capital ratio was at december   up from our year end rate of net debt to total capital is calculated as total debt  net of cash  divided by shareholders equity plus total debt  net of cash 
on january  we paid off a million private placement note that matured and funded our acquisitions of crest and industrial metals with borrowings on our credit facility 
on february   we borrowed additional funds under our credit facility for the purchase of the net assets and business of the encore group 
during we used our borrowings and operating cash flow to fund our increased working capital needs  capital expenditures of approximately million and acquisitions of approximately million 
the acquisitions include the purchase of the remaining interest in american steel  the purchase of the assets and business of flat rock  the purchase of everest metals through our interest in reliance pan pacific  the cash portion of the purchase of emj  and the purchase of yarde metals 
on april   we completed our acquisition of emj with a transaction value of approximately million 
we funded the purchase with million of cash through our credit facility and issued approximately million shares of our common stock at a value of million in equity 
we assumed approximately million of emj s debt  million of which was senior secured notes that were to mature in with the first call date on june  at of face value 
the million emj senior notes were subsequently purchased in november as discussed later in this section 
the cash portion of the purchase of emj included the cash out of certain emj stock option holders for consideration of approximately million 
we also assumed an emj stock option plan with options to purchase  reliance shares and an emj obligation to contribute  shares of our common stock to an emj retirement plan 
we contributed  shares to the plan during and paid out million in lieu of  shares 
at december  the remaining obligation consisted of the cash equivalent of  shares of reliance common stock to be contributed to a phantom stock plan supplementing the emj retirement plan 
we obtained amendments from our bank group and private placement note holders to assume the emj secured debt 
the emj indenture included a change of control provision that allowed the note holders to put their notes to emj at of face value 
we increased our syndicated credit facility from million to million upon closing of the emj transaction to provide adequate financing if the note holders were to all put their notes to emj 
under the change of control provision   of notes were tendered and purchased in may 
table of contents on july   we entered into a day million credit facility to provide adequate funding for our purchase of yarde metals on august  and to allow us to meet our working capital needs 
on october   emj made a cash tender offer to purchase any and all of its outstanding senior secured notes and solicited consent to amend the indenture governing the notes to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and security interests in emj s assets 
the tender offer expired november  with sufficient notes tendered approximately million to effect the requested amendments 
the tender offer was made pursuant to the terms set forth in that offer to purchase and consent solicitation statement that was filed by the company with the sec on a current report on form k on october  the total consideration for the emj notes was  per  principal amount of the notes  including a payment a consent payment  payable to the noteholders who validly consented to the amendments 
holders who validly tendered their notes after the consent date were not eligible to receive the consent payment 
in addition  all holders whose notes were purchased pursuant to the tender offer were paid accrued and unpaid interest on their purchased notes up to  but not including  the settlement date of november  the company funded the purchase of tendered notes through its syndicated credit facility 
notes with a total principal amount of million were tendered and purchased  which had an aggregate carrying value of approximately million  inclusive of unamortized debt premium 
the gain from this debt extinguishment of approximately million has been included in the other income  net caption of the statement of operations 
we funded the purchase of tendered notes through our increased  unsecured syndicated credit facility of billion that replaced the million and million existing bank credit lines 
our five year billion credit facility  which can be increased to billion with the approval of our lenders  is with fifteen lenders and included improved pricing and flexibility compared to the million facility 
following the redemption of the emj senior secured notes and the placement of our increased credit facility  on november   we entered into an indenture the indenture  for the issuance of million of unsecured debt securities which are guaranteed by all of our direct and indirect  wholly owned domestic subsidiaries and any entities that become such subsidiaries during the term of the indenture collectively  the subsidiary guarantors 
none of our foreign subsidiaries or our non wholly owned domestic subsidiaries is a guarantor 
the total debt issued was comprised of two tranches  a million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  and b million aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes bearing interest at the rate of per annum  maturing on november  the notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt obligations 
at our option  we may redeem all or part of the notes of either series at any time prior to their maturity by paying a redemption price equal to the greater of of the aggregate principal amount of the notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments as defined in the indenture  plus  in each case  accrued and unpaid interest thereon to  but not including  the redemption date 
our financing activities lowered our cost of capital and significantly increased our availability to fund our working capital and general corporate needs  including acquisitions 
at december   we also have million of outstanding senior unsecured notes issued in private placements of debt 
the outstanding senior notes bear interest at an average fixed rate of and have an average remaining life of years  maturing from to in  million of these notes will mature 
our billion syndicated credit facility and our senior notes require that we maintain a minimum net worth and interest coverage ratio  and a maximum leverage ratio and include change of control provisions  among other things 
upon our acquisition of chapel steel  we assumed noncancelable capital leases related to three buildings with terms expiring at various years through at december   total obligations under these capital leases were million 
all three leases were with related parties of chapel steel 
capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  were million for the year 
our capital expenditures are currently budgeted at approximately million  excluding acquisitions 
our budget includes several growth initiatives to expand or relocate existing facilities and to add or upgrade equipment 
any capital expenditure commitments that existed at december  are included in the below table of contractual obligations 
our capital and operating lease commitments are discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements and are also included in the contractual obligations table below 
our capital requirements are primarily for working capital  acquisitions  debt repayments and capital expenditures for continued improvements in plant capacities and materials handling and processing equipment 
on may  our board of directors declared a two for one stock split  in the form of a stock dividend on our common stock and a increase in the dividend rate 
the common stock split was effected by issuing one additional share of common stock for each share held by shareholders of record on july  the additional shares were distributed on july  
table of contents on february   our board of directors declared a increase in the regular quarterly cash dividend to 
per share of common stock 
in may  our board of directors amended and restated our stock repurchase program authorizing up to an additional million shares of our common stock to be repurchased 
repurchased shares are treated as authorized but unissued shares 
as of december   and prior to the additional authorization in may  we had repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock under this plan  at an average cost of per share 
we have not repurchased any shares of our common stock since we believe such purchases  given appropriate circumstances  enhance shareholder value and reflect our confidence in the long term growth potential of our company 
proceeds from the issuance of common stock upon the exercise of stock options during were million 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations and funds available under our billion credit facility will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and senior debt repayment needs in the near term 
we also anticipate that we will be able to fund acquisitions with borrowings under our line of credit 
contractual obligations and other commitments the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december  certain of these contractual obligations are reflected on our balance sheet  while others are disclosed as future obligations under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
payments due by year in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other other long term liabilities reflected on the balance sheet under gaap total amounts include principal payments only 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for information regarding interest rates  payment dates and expected refinancing 
the majority of our material purchases are completed within to days and therefore are not included in this table except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace materials 
includes the estimated benefit payments or contribution amounts for the company s defined benefit pension plans and serp plans for the next ten years 
these amounts are limited to the information provided by our actuaries 
contractual obligations for purchases of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on our company and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current needs and are typically fulfilled by our vendors within short time periods 
in addition  some of our purchase orders represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of goods specifying minimum quantities and set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
therefore  agreements for the purchase of goods and services are not included in the table above except for certain purchases where we have significant lead times or corresponding long term sales commitments  typically for aerospace materials 
the expected timing of payments of the obligations above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different  depending on the time of receipt of goods or services  or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 

table of contents inflation our operations have not been  and we do not expect them to be  materially affected by general inflation 
historically  we have been successful in adjusting prices to our customers to reflect changes in metal prices 
seasonality some of our customers may be in seasonal businesses  especially customers in the construction industry 
as a result of our geographic  product and customer diversity  however  our operations have not shown any material seasonal trends 
revenues in the months of july  november and december traditionally have been lower than in other months because of a reduced number of working days for shipments of our products  resulting from vacation and holiday closures at some of our customers 
we cannot assure you that period to period fluctuations will not occur in the future 
results of any one or more quarters are therefore not necessarily indicative of annual results

we review the recoverability of goodwill annually or whenever significant events or changes occur which might impair the recovery of recorded costs 
we measure possible impairment based on either significant losses of an entity or the ability to recover the balance of the long lived asset from expected future operating cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if impairment is identified  we would calculate the amount of such impairment based upon the discounted cash flows or the market values as compared to the recorded costs 
we have performed tests of goodwill as of november  and  and believe that the recorded amounts for goodwill are recoverable and that no impairment currently exists 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when we prepare these consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require that we make subjective judgments  including estimates that involve matters that are inherently uncertain 
our most critical accounting estimates include those related to accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill and intangible assets and long lived assets 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting estimates  as discussed with our audit committee  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for our summary of significant accounting policies 
there have been no material changes made to the critical accounting estimates during the periods presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we also have other policies that we consider key accounting policies  such as for revenue recognition  however these policies do not require us to make subjective estimates or judgments 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect our estimate of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable based on an evaluation of specific potential customer risks 
assessments are based on legal issues bankruptcy status  our past collection history  current financial and credit agency reports  and the experience of our credit personnel 
accounts which we determine to be uncollectible are reserved for or written off in the period in which the determination is made 
additional reserves are maintained based on our historical and estimated future bad debt experience 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we might be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts 

table of contents inventories we maintain allowances for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory to reflect the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on an evaluation of slow moving products and current replacement costs 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated by management  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 
for information regarding our provision for income taxes as well as information regarding differences between our effective tax rate and statutory rates  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our estimates of credits or deductions including those that may result from the american jobs creation act of  changes in our assessment of tax exposure items  and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
goodwill and intangible assets in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
we have performed impairment testing in accordance with sfas no 
we perform an annual review in the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist  to determine if the carrying value of the recorded goodwill is impaired 
our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we estimate the reporting unit s fair value based on a discounted future cash flow approach that requires us to estimate income from operations based on historical results and discount rates based on a weighted average cost of capital of comparable companies 
a key assumption made is that  in general  our revenues will grow at to per year  adjusted for the current economic outlook 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
long lived assets we review the recoverability of our long lived assets as required by sfas no 
and must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets not previously recorded 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in april  the united states securities and exchange commission sec approved a new rule that delayed the effective date of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r  share based payment 
except for this deferral of the effective date  the guidance in sfas no 
r was unchanged 
under the sec s rule  sfas no 
r became effective for us for annual  rather than interim  periods that began after june  we began applying this statement to all awards granted on or after january  and to awards modified  repurchased  vested or cancelled after that date 
the stock based compensation expense in accordance with fas r was  for the year ended december  recorded in warehouse  delivery  selling  general and administrative expense caption of our consolidated statement of income 
the implementation of this standard is further discussed in note  stock option plans 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement principles for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   or as of january  for us 
although we are currently under audit by various tax authorities  we do not believe the adoption of fin no 
will have a material impact on our beginning retained earnings 

table of contents in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september the fasb also issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statement no 
  and r 
this standard requires recognition of the funded status of a benefit plan in the statement of financial position 
the standard also requires recognition in other comprehensive income of certain gains and losses that arise during the period but are deferred under pension accounting rules  as well as modifies the timing of reporting and adds certain disclosures 
sfas no 
provides recognition and disclosure elements to be effective as of the end of the fiscal year after december  and measurement elements to be effective for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the recognition provisions of sfas no 
and applied them to the funded status of our defined benefit and postretirement plans as of december  the initial recognition of the funded status of our defined benefit and postretirement plans resulted in a decrease in shareholders equity of million  which was net of a tax benefit of million 
the implementation of this standard is further discussed in note  employee benefit plans 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to various market risk factors  including changes in general economic conditions  domestic and foreign competition  foreign currency exchange rates  and metals pricing and availability 
commodity price risk metal prices are volatile due to  among other things  fluctuations in foreign and domestic production capacity  raw material availability  metals consumption and foreign currency rates 
decreases in metal prices could adversely affect our revenues  gross profit and net income 
because we primarily purchase and sell in the spot market ie  without long term contracts we are able to react quickly to changes in metals pricing 
foreign exchange rate risk because we have foreign operations  we are exposed to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
volatility in these markets could impact our net income 
based on our limited foreign operations and the currencies in which they transact business  we do not consider this risk to be material 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk related to our fixed rate and variable rate long term debt 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect the market value of our fixed rate debt 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes and we do not currently anticipate repayment of our fixed rate long term debt prior to its scheduled maturities 
market risk related to our variable rate debt is estimated as the potential decrease in pretax earnings resulting from an increase in interest rates 
based on million of variable rate debt outstanding on our syndicated credit facility as of december   a hypothetical one percent increase in interest rates would not result in a material impact to earnings
