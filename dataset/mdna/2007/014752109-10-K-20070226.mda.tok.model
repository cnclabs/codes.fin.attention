critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the assets estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
betterments  significant renewals and certain costs directly related to the acquisition  improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
as real estate is undergoing development activities  all property operating expenses  including interest expense  are capitalized to the cost of the real property to the extent that we believe such costs are recoverable through the value of the property 
the recognition of depreciation expense requires estimates by us of the useful life of each property and improvement  as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property  including capitalized costs  to its various components 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense could be misstated 
our properties are reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change  indicating that the carrying amount of the property may not be recoverable 
in such an event  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of the property 
the carrying amount of an asset would be adjusted  if necessary  to reflect an impairment in the value of the asset 
if we incorrectly estimate undiscounted cash flows  impairment charges may be different 
the impact of such estimates in connection with future impairment analyses could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
as of december  and  we had no impairment charges 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements 
we also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
we exercise judgment in establishing these allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
revenue recognition we have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent revenue arising from tenant leases these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases 
we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use 
in addition  in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
percentage rent revenue arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of tenants exceeding defined thresholds these rents are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which states that this contingent revenue is only to be recognized after the contingency has been removed ie  the sales threshold has been achieved 
expense reimbursement revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective properties this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
condominium sales income arising from the sales of condominium units at the lexington avenue property income on deposits received for sales of condominium units has been deferred in accordance with the deposit method of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
gains on sales of condominium units are recognized under the percentage of completion method 
we assess  among other things  the collectibility of revenue before recognition 
if we incorrectly assess collectibility of revenue  net earnings and assets could be misstated 
income taxes we operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
under the code  our net operating loss carryovers nols generally would be available to offset the amount of our reit taxable income that would otherwise be required to be distributed as dividends to our stockholders 
we have elected to treat our wholly owned subsidiary  residential llc  as a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
the trs is subject to income tax at regular corporate tax rates 
our nols will not be available to offset taxable income of trs 
as of december   all of the residential condominium units were sold and closed 
in connection therewith  during the years ended december  and  trs recognized  and  of income tax expense  respectively  of which  and  were paid in the years ended december  and  respectively 
trs deferred income taxes  where applicable  are accounted for in accordance with statements of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
however  deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence  including tax planning strategies and other factors 
stock appreciation rights stock appreciation rights sars are granted at of the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
compensation expense for each sar is measured by the excess of the stock price at the current balance sheet date over the stock price at the previous balance sheet date 
if the stock price is lower at the current balance sheet date  previously recognized expense is reversed  but not below zero 
recently issued accounting literature on december   the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r replaces sfas and requires that the compensation cost relating to share based payment transactions be recognized in financial statements and measured based on the fair value of the equity or liability instruments issued 
we adopted sfas r on the modified prospective method on january  this adoption did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion and sfas sfas changes the requirements for the accounting and reporting of a change in accounting principle by requiring retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of the change in accounting principle  unless it is impracticable to do so 
sfas also requires that a change in depreciation or amortization for long lived  non financial assets be accounted for as a change in accounting estimate effected by a change in accounting principle 
sfas is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas on january  this adoption had no effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments an amendment of fasb statements no 
and the purpose of sfas is to simplify the accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments by permitting fair value re measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 
sfas is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  the adoption of sfas on january   did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for servicing financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas requires separate recognition of a servicing asset and a servicing liability each time an entity undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract 
this statement also requires that servicing assets and liabilities be initially recorded at fair value and subsequently be adjusted to the fair value at the end of each reporting period 
sfas is effective for an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september  the adoption of sfas on january   did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin establishes new evaluation and measurement processes for all income tax positions taken 
we are currently in the process of analyzing our uncertain tax positions  however  based on information currently available  we believe that the adoption of fin could result in a cumulative effect adjustment in the range of  to  which would be accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 
this estimate is subject to revision upon the completion of our analysis 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas does not address what to measure at fair value  instead  it addresses how to measure fair value 
sfas applies with limited exceptions to existing standards that require assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value 
sfas establishes a fair value hierarchy  giving the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data and requires new disclosures for assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe that the adoption of sfas on january   will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of sfas no 
  and r 
sfas requires an employer to i recognize in its statement of financial position an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  ii measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year with limited exceptions  and iii recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
those changes will be reported in comprehensive income 
the requirement to recognize the funded status of a benefit plan and the disclosure requirements are effective as of the end of the fiscal year ending after december  the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the measurement date provisions is effective for fiscal years ending after december  the adoption of sfas is not expected to have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which becomes effective for the first fiscal period ending after november  sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior period misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab requires an entity to evaluate the impact of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on current year financial statements 
the adoption of sab on december  did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas expands opportunities to use fair value measurement in financial reporting and permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we have not decided if we will early adopt sfas or if we will choose to measure any eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value

rental income from our properties is our principal source of operating cash flow 
our property rental income is dependent on a number of factors including the occupancy level and rental rates of our properties  as well as our tenants ability to pay their rents 
our properties provide us with a relatively consistent stream of cash flow that enables us to pay our operating expenses  non development capital improvements and interest expense 
other sources of liquidity to fund our cash requirements include our existing cash  proceeds from debt financings  including mortgage or construction loans secured by our properties and proceeds from asset sales

nareit defines ffo as net income or loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo and ffo per diluted share are used by management  investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity reits 
ffo and ffo per diluted share should be evaluated along with gaap net income and income per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measures  as well as cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  in evaluating the operating performance of equity reits 
management believes that ffo and ffo per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  these non gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the company s statements of cash flows 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo for the year ended december  was a negative  or per diluted share  compared to a positive  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  negative ffo for the year ended december  includes  for an accrual of sars compensation expense  partially offset by   for an after tax net gain from the sale of residential condominium units at lexington avenue 
these items  in the aggregate  decreased ffo by  or per diluted share 
ffo for the year ended december  includes   for an after tax net gain from the sale of residential condominium units at lexington avenue and  of income from the settlement of claims against third parties for environmental remediation at kings plaza  partially offset by   for an accrual of sars compensation expense 
these items  in the aggregate  increased ffo by  or per diluted share 
for the year ended december  amounts in thousands  except share and per share amounts net loss income depreciation and amortization of real property negative ffo ffo negative ffo ffo per common share diluted weighted average shares used in computing diluted ffo per share item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we had  of fixed rate debt at a weighted average interest rate of  as such we have no exposure to changes in interest rates for the remaining terms of our existing debt 
the fair value of our debt  estimated by discounting the future cash flows using the current rates available to borrowers with similar credit ratings for the remaining terms of such debt  is less than the aggregate carrying amount by approximately  at december
