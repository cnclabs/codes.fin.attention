item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
please note that unless otherwise specifically indicated  discussion of our results relate to our continuing operations 
this discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based upon assumptions as to future events that may not prove to be accurate 
executive summary we are the second largest non hazardous solid waste management company in the united states  as measured by revenues 
we provide non hazardous solid waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services in states and puerto rico  geographically identified as the midwestern  northeastern  southeastern  southwestern and western regions 
our revenues result primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
we generally provide collection services under direct agreements with our customers or pursuant to contracts with municipalities 
commercial and municipal contract terms generally range from one to five years and commonly have renewal options 
our landfill operations include both company owned landfills and landfills that we operate on behalf of municipalities and others 
we consistently invest capital to support the ongoing operations of our landfill and collection business 
landfills are highly engineered  sophisticated facilities similar to civil works 
each year we invest capital at our active landfills to ensure sufficient capacity to receive the waste volume we handle 
in addition  we have approximately  collection vehicles and approximately million containers to serve our collection customers 
our vehicles and containers endure rough conditions each day and must be routinely maintained and replaced 
during the year ended december   we invested million of capital into the business see note  property and equipment  for detail by fixed asset category 
in  total capital expenditures are expected to be approximately million 
cash flows in our business are generally predictable as a result of the nature of our customer base and the essential service we provide to the communities where we operate 
this predictability has enabled us to consistently reinvest in the business and to service our debt obligations 
knowing this  we have incurred debt to acquire the assets we own and we have paid cash to acquire existing cash flow streams 
this financial model should allow us over time to transfer the enterprise value of the company from debt holders to shareholders as we use our cash flow to repay debt 
we continue to use cash flow from operations after capital expenditures to reduce our debt balance 
results of operations net income for was million  a decrease of million compared to the prior year 
although we experienced higher revenues and lower interest expense  net income decreased as a result of an increase in income tax expense 
our revenues grew million for the year ended december   driven by organic revenue growth of 
revenues increased across all service lines except for our recycling business 
operating income for the year increased by million to million over the prior year 
operating costs increased as a result of volume increases and normal inflation 
additionally  fuel costs increased due to the significant rise in oil prices  and subcontractor costs increased because of a strategic decision to expand our national accounts  resulting in an increase in the amount of work we subcontract to other waste handlers 
gross margin for improved basis points over the prior year 
operating income for was reduced by losses from divestitures and asset impairments totaling million 
interest expense decreased during primarily due to lower costs incurred to early extinguish and refinance debt compared to the prior year  partially offset by the impact of rising interest rates on the variable rate portion of our debt 

table of contents income tax expense increased by million or from million in to million in primarily due to increased pre tax income as well as charges totaling million recorded during the fourth quarter 
in  income tax expense was reduced by a million benefit related to additional stock basis associated with a divestiture 
we continue to implement best practices  including improving sales productivity and pricing effectiveness  driver productivity through improved routing and maintenance efficiency through standardized operating practices  as well as reducing our procurement costs through more effective purchasing 
we are also focused on improving the effectiveness of our safety and our health and welfare programs 
we realized tangible benefits from many of these initiatives during the year 
in addition  we continue to focus on improving our return on invested capital by carefully evaluating the return potential of new capital expenditures and by evaluating opportunities to divest operations that do not provide an adequate return 
accordingly  we divested of operations that generated million of annual revenue primarily in the northeastern and midwestern regions during we spent million on capital expenditures during and plan to spend approximately million in we expect this investment  along with improved maintenance practices  to have a favorable impact on maintenance costs and route productivity 
during the second half of  maintenance and repairs expense was lower than the same period in and route productivity improved 
financing activities we remain committed to our long term strategy of reducing our debt balance 
as this occurs  we believe the relative cost of debt and interest expense should decline 
upon achieving optimal credit ratios  we should have the opportunity to choose the best use of any excess cash flow further repay debt  pay a dividend to the extent permitted by our debt agreements  repurchase stock or further reinvest in our company 
we may take advantage of opportunities that arise to accelerate the de leveraging process as long as the opportunities are economically advantageous and meet our need to maintain our competitive strength 
in april  we completed the re pricing of the term loan and institutional letter of credit portions of our senior secured credit facility credit facility 
the term loan and institutional letter of credit facility re priced at libor plus basis points or alternative base rate abr plus basis points  a reduction of basis points 
this re pricing is expected to generate more than million in annual interest savings 
the pricing will further decrease to libor plus basis points or abr plus basis points when our leverage ratio is equal to or less than x 
in may  we issued million of senior notes due at a discounted price equal to of the aggregate principal amount 
the net proceeds were used to fund a portion of the tender of our senior notes due the refinancing of the senior notes is expected to generate approximately million in after tax annual interest savings 
in conjunction with the re pricing and refinancing transactions in  we expensed approximately million of costs related to premiums paid  deferred financing and other costs 
during  we made optional prepayments totaling million on our term loan with excess cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of assets 
we continue to focus on maximizing cash flow to repay debt and we seek opportunities to create additional cash flow through reductions in interest cost while continuing to support our fixed asset base with appropriate capital expenditures 
during  we reduced our debt balance by million to billion 
we continue to improve our debt to total capitalization ratio  which decreased to at the end of from at the end of 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations and percentage relationship that the various items bear to revenues for the periods indicated in millions  except percentages

we generate revenues primarily from fees charged to customers for waste collection  transfer  recycling and disposal services 
we consider our core business to be our collection and disposal operations 
we also generate revenue from the sale of recycled commodities 
we record revenue as the services are provided  with revenue deferred in instances where services are billed in advance of the service being provided 
national accounts revenue included in other revenue represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas  and as such  the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators 
consequently  substantially all of this revenue is offset by the corresponding subcontract costs 
the following table shows our total reported revenues by service line 
intercompany revenues have been eliminated

consists of revenue generated from commercial  industrial and residential customers from waste collected in roll off containers that are loaded onto collection vehicles 
consists primarily of revenue from national accounts where the work has been subcontracted  revenue generated from transporting waste via railway or truck and revenue from liquid waste 

table of contents our operations are not concentrated in any one geographic region 
at december   we operated in major markets in states and puerto rico 
our regional teams focus on developing local markets in which we can operate a vertically integrated operation and maximize operating efficiency 
as a result  we may choose not to operate in a market where our business objectives cannot be met 
we modified our field organizational structure by reducing the number of our operating regions to five from nine  realigning some of our districts among the regions and increasing our regional support staff to add functional expertise and oversight in areas that are aligned with our strategic value drivers effective october   with some refinements being completed during the first half of the following table shows our revenues by geographic region in total and as a percentage of total revenues 
revenues by region in millions  except percentages year ended december  midwestern northeastern southeastern southwestern western other total revenues see discussion in note to our consolidated financial statements 
amounts relate primarily to our subsidiaries that provide services throughout the organization and not on a regional basis 
revenues in the prior periods have been restated to conform to our current operating structure 
cost of operations 
cost of operations includes labor and related benefits  which consists of salaries and wages  health and welfare benefits  incentive compensation and payroll taxes 
it also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations  maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles  equipment  and containers  including related labor and benefit costs  transportation and subcontractor costs which include costs for independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas  fuel which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles  net of fuel credits  disposal and franchise fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes  municipal franchise fees  host community fees and royalties  landfill operating costs which includes landfill accretion  financial assurance  leachate disposal and other landfill maintenance costs  risk management which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims  cost of goods sold which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities  and other which includes expenses such as facility operating costs  equipment rent  and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management  field support functions  sales force  accounting and finance  legal  management information systems and clerical and administrative departments 
it also includes rent and office costs  fees for professional services provided by third parties  such as accountants  lawyers and consultants  provisions for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable and other expenses such as marketing  investor and community relations  directors and officers insurance  employee relocation  travel  entertainment and bank charges 
the following tables provide the components of our selling  general and administrative costs and as a percentage of revenues in millions  except percentages year ended december  salaries rent and office costs professional fees provision for doubtful accounts other total selling  general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization includes depreciation of fixed assets and amortization costs associated with the acquisition  development and retirement of landfill airspace and intangible assets 
depreciation is provided on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of assets 
the estimated useful lives of assets are buildings and improvements years  vehicles and equipment years  containers and compactors years and furniture and office equipment years 
for building improvements  the depreciable life can be the shorter of the improvements estimated useful lives or related lease terms 
landfill assets are amortized at a rate per ton of waste disposed 
see critical accounting judgments and estimates and note  to our consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for a discussion of landfill accounting 
depreciation expense of vehicles increases as fully depreciated trucks are replaced by new vehicles 
amortization of landfill assets is impacted by several factors including rates of inflation  landfill expansions and compaction rates 
the following tables provide the components of our depreciation and amortization and as a percentage of revenues in millions  except percentages year ended december  depreciation of fixed assets landfill and other amortization total depreciation and amortization landfill disposal capacity and operating lives 
we had available landfill disposal capacity of approximately billion tons as of december  we classify this disposal capacity as either permitted having received the final permit from the governing authorities or probable expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable 
throughout the year  one landfill was certified closed and there were no active landfills acquired or divested  leaving active landfills as of december  the number of sites with probable expansion disposal capacity decreased from to new probable expansions were added at sites and sites were removed from probable expansion due to successful expansions 
in addition to these seven sites  we had increases in overall permitted capacity at seven sites where the disposal capacity was not previously classified as probable expansion 
see critical accounting judgments and estimates and note  landfill accounting for our requirements to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion 

table of contents the following table reflects disposal capacity activity for active landfills we owned or operated for the year ended december  disposal capacity in millions of tons probable permitted expansion disposal disposal total disposal capacity capacity capacity balance as of december  acquisitions  divestitures and closures additions to probable expansion disposal capacity net change to permitted disposal capacity disposal capacity consumed changes in engineering estimates balance as of december  relates primarily to increased density of waste at our landfills resulting from improved operational procedures  optimization of daily cover materials and improved utilization of compaction equipment 
the following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our landfill assets based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes at december  at december  number of sites percent of total number of sites percent of total to years to years to years to years years total interest expense and other includes the following components in millions year ended december  interest expense and other interest expense  gross cash settlement on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts interest income interest capitalized for development projects accretion of debt and amortization of debt issuance costs non cash gain on non hedge accounting interest rate swap contracts amortization of accumulated other comprehensive loss for de designated interest rate swap contracts costs incurred to early extinguish debt interest expense allocated to discontinued operations total interest expense and other from continuing operations years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased over the prior year  as all lines of business increased except for recycling commodity 
the revenue increase within the collection business was primarily driven by increases in the commercial and roll off lines of business 
the revenue increase within the disposal business was primarily attributable to landfill revenue increases 
recycling revenue decreased due to cardboard and newspaper commodity price declines as well as volume declines 
other revenue increased as a result of waste volume increases associated with the subcontracted portion of our national accounts 
following is a summary of the change in revenues in millions reported revenues in core business organic growth increase from average base per unit price change increase from fuel recovery fees increase from net volume change net divested revenues and adjustments decrease in recycling and other reported revenues in 
table of contents during the year ended december   we generated organic revenue growth of  of which million or was attributable to our average price per unit on core business 
our continued price growth reflected the results of pricing increases implemented throughout the year 
within the collection business  average per unit pricing increased   and  respectively  in the commercial  roll off  residential and recycling collection lines of business for the year ended december  within the disposal line of business  landfill and transfer average per unit pricing increased and  respectively 
the fuel recovery fee program  implemented in to mitigate our exposure to increases in fuel prices  generated of the total price growth for the year ended december  this fee fluctuates with the price of fuel  and  consequently  fuel price declines would result in a decrease in our revenue  which would be more than offset by a decrease in our fuel expense 
core business volume growth was compared to the prior year  primarily driven by volume increases related to subcontract and transportation revenues 
within the collection business  the commercial and roll off lines of business experienced volume increases of and  respectively 
volume for the residential line of business decreased slightly while recycling collection volume declined during within the disposal business  landfill and transfer volumes decreased by and  respectively 
the decline in landfill volume was primarily due to reductions in special waste volumes in the current year 
we are improving our pricing structure and return criteria for special waste jobs in an effort to improve the returns on this area of landfill volume 
subcontract and transportation volume increased and  respectively  primarily driven by the growth associated with our national accounts in cost of operations 
cost of operations increased in compared to the prior year  driven by increases in fuel  transportation and subcontractor costs  partially offset by decreases in risk management and other expenses 
the increase in transportation and subcontractor costs primarily reflected our volume growth in our national accounts and fuel cost increases 
risk management costs decreased due to favorable adjustments associated with risk and health insurance as a result of changes in estimates due to favorable claims experience 
other expense decreased partly as a result of an million favorable adjustment to our environmental reserves in  primarily due to the selection by the us environmental protection agency of a lower cost remediation plan for a superfund site at which we are a potentially responsible party 
fuel costs increased because of higher fuel prices and the expiration of certain fixed price purchase contracts 
a significant portion of these contracts expired in early all fixed price purchase contracts expired as of march   and  unless new contracts are executed  all future fuel purchases will be at market rates 
for the year ended december   the contracts in place reduced fuel costs by million when compared to then current market prices 
we expect that our fuel recovery fee will offset a portion of the volatility in fuel costs arising from future market price fluctuations 
at december   approximately of our customers participated in the fuel recovery fee program 
labor costs remained constant in primarily due to our on going labor efficiency efforts 
maintenance and repairs costs increased only slightly compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the increased level of vehicle purchases and improved maintenance practices in the last two years 
these costs actually declined in the second half of compared to the same period a year ago 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased in as compared to primarily relating to salaries  professional fees and other expenses 
the increase in salaries included the impact of higher incentive compensation resulting from improved performance in  severances associated with an initiative to control labor costs and other unrelated separations that occurred during in addition  the increase in salaries in also reflected the impact of normal inflation  benefits costs and stock option expense recognized due to the adoption of sfas r as of january  professional fees increased as a result of consulting fees related to initiatives to standardize sales programs  invest in national accounts systems improvements and implement procurement programs during the year 
the increase in other expense was primarily attributable to a million reversal of litigation reserves during 
table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased in the year ended december  as compared to depreciation expense related to vehicles and equipment increased primarily due to increases in capital expenditures in recent periods 
for the year ended december   landfill amortization increased slightly due to increased amortization rates  partially offset by volume decreases 
loss from divestitures and asset impairments 
during  we recorded losses of approximately million related to divestitures and asset impairments 
asset sales  completed as a result of our market rationalization focus  generated a loss of approximately million 
these losses primarily related to operations in our northeastern and midwestern regions 
during  we also recorded landfill asset impairment charges of approximately million as a result of management s decision to discontinue development and or operations of three landfill sites 
additionally  during we recognized a million expense associated with the relocation of our operations support center 
interest expense and other 
interest expense and other decreased by in as compared to gross interest expense increased slightly during the year as a result of rising interest rates on the variable portion of our debt  offset by lower debt levels as a result of our continued de leveraging strategy and the refinancing of debt at lower interest rates in the first quarter of refinancing plan and second quarter of in connection with the refinancing transactions  we incurred costs to early extinguish and refinance debt of million and million  respectively  during the years ended december  and income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to in income tax expense increased by million or from million in to million in primarily due to increased pre tax income 
other factors contributing to the increase included interest charges totaling million on previously recorded liabilities currently under review by the applicable taxing authorities as a result of developments during the fourth quarter  adjustments attributable to prior periods totaling million relating to two state income tax matters involving tax years prior to which were identified during the fourth quarter and which were determined to be immaterial to prior years financial statements an additional million was charged to goodwill for one of these matters  and a net increase in the valuation allowance of million for the deferred tax assets relating to certain of our state net operating loss carryforwards including a million charge recorded in the fourth quarter due to an updated recoverability assessment 
in  income tax expense was reduced by a million benefit related to additional stock basis associated with a divestiture 
dividends on preferred stock 
dividends on preferred stock were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease of million for the year ended december  resulted from the conversion of the series c mandatory convertible preferred stock series c preferred stock 
the series c preferred stock was converted into approximately million shares of common stock on april   eliminating approximately million of annual dividends 
this decrease was partially offset as a result of having the series d mandatory convertible preferred stock series d preferred stock issued in march outstanding for the full year 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased over the prior year driven by increases in our collection and disposal lines of business 
the revenue increase within the collection business was driven by increases in each of the residential  commercial and roll off lines of business 
within the disposal business  landfill revenue increased while transfer revenue remained flat year over year 
recycling revenue decreased as commodity prices declined during the year while other revenue increased primarily due to the increase in national account related revenue 
following is a summary of the change in revenues in millions reported revenues in core business organic growth increase from average base per unit price change increase from fuel recovery fees increase from net volume change net divested revenues and adjustments decrease in recycling and other reported revenues in 
table of contents revenue growth relating to our average price per unit on core business was million compared to million in the prior year 
our price growth of reflected the result of our continued focus on our pricing initiatives during average per unit pricing for all lines within the collection business and for the transfer and landfill businesses increased 
the improvement in price resulted from more central control of pricing 
the fuel recovery fee program implemented during generated million or of the total price growth in the current year 
core business volume growth for the year ended december  was  of which approximately primarily related to subcontract revenue from national accounts and hurricane clean up work resulting from the gulf coast hurricanes 
commercial and roll off volumes increased by and  respectively 
landfill volume increased  while volume for the transfer business decreased slightly from the prior year 
the growth in our volume reflected improvement in the economy  increases in special waste jobs  more effective sales practices and the impact of hurricane debris clean up work 
cost of operations 
cost of operations increased in compared to the prior year due to increases in labor  maintenance and repairs  transportation and subcontract costs  fuel and risk management expenses 
labor costs increased as a function of inflation and higher benefits costs 
the increase in maintenance and repair expenses was attributable to additional repair costs due to fleet age 
this trend improved during the year  with maintenance and repairs actually decreasing in the fourth quarter of compared to the same period a year ago 
transportation and subcontractor costs increased primarily as a function of volume increases from national accounts  additional subcontract costs for hurricane debris clean up work during the third and fourth quarters and increases in pass through fuel expenses 
fuel costs increased due to the impact of higher fuel prices during the year 
the increase in risk management expenses was driven primarily by million of insurance liability adjustments incurred during the current year due to adverse property and casualty experience 
also included in other operating costs were million of charges related to lost or damaged equipment and facilities in the areas affected by the gulf coast hurricanes in and a million loss on assets held for sale 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by million or in primarily relating to decreases in professional fees and other expenses  partially offset by increases in salaries 
the year over year decrease in professional fees of million is attributable to prior year expenses associated with the implementation of sox and the best practices program 
the decrease in other expenses primarily related to million of the reversals of litigation reserves in of that amount  million pertained to a favorable court ruling involving bfi that had been pending appeal since salary expenses in included million of costs associated with an executive departure and our field organization realignment in the fourth quarter of depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization decreased in as compared to the decrease in amortization expenses is primarily related to lower amortization rates due to increases in landfill capacity from expansions and compaction improvement  partially offset by increased volumes 
depreciation expense related to equipment increased during  primarily due to increases in capital expenditures in the second half of and throughout interest expense and other 
interest expense and other decreased by in the decrease in gross interest expense was attributable primarily to the repayment of debt and refinancing of debt at lower interest rates 
we expensed million of costs to early extinguish and refinance debt during  compared to million of costs for similar activities during income tax expense 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december  was compared to for the same period in income tax expense for the year ended december  included a benefit of approximately million related to additional stock basis associated with a divestiture pending at december  that was completed in february the decrease in the effective income tax rate in was also partly due to provision to return adjustments resulting from the finalizing of income tax returns in the fourth quarter of and the increase in annual earnings before taxes in 
table of contents discontinued operations 
there were no divestitures during that have been presented as discontinued operations 
however  discontinued operations in included a previously deferred gain of approximately million million gain  net of tax 
this deferred gain was attributable to a divestiture that occurred in where the acquirer had the right to sell the operations back to us for a period of time a put agreement  thus constituting a form of continuing involvement on our part that precluded recognition of the gain in in the third quarter of  these operations were sold to another third party and the put agreement was cancelled 
discontinued operations in the year also included a million pre tax benefit million after tax resulting from a revision of our insurance liabilities related to divestitures previously reported as discontinued operations 
dividends on preferred stock 
dividends on preferred stock were million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase of million for the year ended december  was a result of the dividends payable in cash for the series d preferred stock issued in march dividends on preferred stock also included the dividends payable in cash for the series c preferred stock issued in april liquidity and capital resources our capital structure consists of debt and equity at december  the majority of our debt was incurred to acquire solid waste companies between and we incurred and assumed over billion of debt to acquire bfi in since the acquisition of bfi  we have repaid debt with cash flow from operations  asset sales and the issuance of equity 
we intend to continue to reduce our debt balance until we reach credit ratios we believe will allow us to benefit from a cost of capital afforded by investment grade companies 
we believe that as we move towards these ratios  we will have additional opportunities to reduce our cost of debt below our current level on a basis relative to interest rates at the time 
we expect these opportunities will increase liquidity and shareholder value  and provide more flexibility in deciding the most appropriate use of our cash flow 
we may refinance or repay portions of our debt to ensure a capital structure that supports our operating plan  as well as continue to seek opportunities to extend our maturities in the future with actions that are economically beneficial 
the potential alternatives include continued application of cash flow from operations  asset sales and capital markets transactions 
we continue to evaluate the performance of and opportunities to divest operations that do not maximize operating efficiencies or provide an adequate return on invested capital 
capital markets transactions could include issuance of debt with longer maturities  issuance of equity  or a combination of both 
we generally meet operational liquidity needs with operating cash flows 
our liquidity needs are primarily for working capital  capital expenditures for vehicles  containers and landfill development  capping  closure  post closure and environmental expenditures  debt service costs  cash taxes  and scheduled debt maturities 
when we cannot meet our liquidity needs with operating cash flow  we meet those needs with borrowings under our credit facility 
we have a billion commitment until under our credit facility  which we believe is adequate to meet our liquidity needs based on current conditions 
at december   we had no loans outstanding and million in letters of credit drawn on the revolver  leaving approximately billion of availability 
both the million incremental revolving letter of credit facility and million institutional letter of credit facility were fully utilized at december  during the third and fourth quarters of  we made optional prepayments of million and million  respectively  on the term loan 
these payments were made with excess cash flow from operations and proceeds from the sale of assets

during  we acquired solid waste operations representing approximately million million  net of intercompany eliminations in annual revenues and sold operations representing approximately million million  net of intercompany eliminations in annual revenues 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased in compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in net income from continuing operations after adjusting for the impact of deferred taxes and a decreased use of working capital of approximately million  primarily related to the timing of operating activities and capital expenditure disbursements 
cash used for investing activities declined by over  as a result of the increase in proceeds from divestitures  net of costs of acquisitions of approximately million  and slightly lower capital expenditures 
debt repayments  including the million term loan prepayments in the third and fourth quarters and the change in disbursement account are the primary drivers in the increase of cash used for financing activities 
the disbursement account represents outstanding checks as of december

in addition to funding our working capital needs and reducing debt  we are committed to efficiently investing in our capital asset base 
our goal is to generate returns that are above our weighted average cost of capital 
our capital expenditures are primarily for the construction and build out of our landfills  for the vehicles and containers used by our collection operations and for heavy equipment used in both our collection and landfill operations 
we maintain a level of annual capital expenditures in order to control repair and maintenance costs  improve productivity and improve quality of customer service 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million in we expect this investment  along with improved maintenance practices  to reduce the total cost of our truck fleet ownership 
following is a summary of capital expenditures for the years ended december in millions vehicles  containers and heavy equipment landfill development other total capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions includes land and improvements  buildings and improvements  and furniture and office equipment 
financing activities 
we continuously seek opportunities to increase our cash flow through improvements in operations and reduction of our interest cost 
historically  we have used bank financings and capital markets transactions to meet our refinancing and liquidity requirements 
under our credit facility  we are required to meet certain financial covenants 
our objective is to maintain sufficient surplus between the required covenant ratios and the actual ratios calculated according to the credit agreement 
we monitor the surplus carefully and will seek to take action if the surplus becomes too small 
we have not historically experienced difficulty in obtaining financing or refinancing existing debt 
we expect to continue to seek such opportunities in the future to the extent such opportunities are available to us 
we cannot assure you opportunities to obtain financing or to refinance existing debt will be available to us on favorable terms  or at all 
see also debt covenants in contractual obligations and commitments 
significant financing events in on april   each of the outstanding shares of our series c preferred stock automatically converted into shares of our common stock pursuant to the terms of the related certificate of designations 
this increased our common shares outstanding by approximately million shares as of april   and eliminated annual cash dividends of million 

table of contents the conversion rate  pursuant to the terms set forth in the certificate of designations  was equal to divided by the threshold appreciation price  as the average of the closing prices per share of our common stock on each of the consecutive trading days ending on march  the third trading day preceding the conversion date was greater than the threshold appreciation price 
each holder of series c preferred stock on the applicable record date received a cash payment equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends 
as a result of the automatic conversion  we no longer pay quarterly dividends in cash or stock with respect to the series c preferred stock 
each holder of series c preferred stock on the conversion date received cash in lieu of any fractional shares of common stock issued upon conversion of the series c preferred stock 
in april  we completed the re pricing of the term loan and institutional letter of credit portions of our credit facility 
the term loan and institutional letter of credit facility re priced at libor plus basis points or abr plus basis points  a reduction of basis points 
this re pricing is expected to generate more than million in annual interest savings 
the pricing will further decrease to libor plus basis points or abr plus basis points when our leverage ratio is equal to or less than x 
in may  we issued million of senior notes due at a discounted price equal to of the aggregate principal amount and used the net proceeds to fund a portion of the tender offer for our senior notes due the refinancing of the senior notes is expected to generate approximately million in annual interest savings 
in conjunction with the re pricing and refinancing transactions in  we expensed approximately million of costs related to premiums paid  deferred financing and other costs 
in june  we filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the sec 
it allows us to issue  from time to time  an unrestricted amount of debt securities  preferred stock  common stock  debt and equity warrants  depositary shares including an indeterminate amount of debt securities  preferred stock and common stock as may be issued upon conversion or exchange for any of our other securities

table of contents debt covenants 
our credit facility and the indentures relating to our senior subordinated notes and our senior notes contain financial covenants and restrictions on our ability to complete acquisitions  pay dividends  incur indebtedness  make investments and take certain other corporate actions 
under the credit facility  our primary financial covenants are minimum interest coverage from the quarter ending through the quarter ending ebitda interest january  december  x january  june  x july  december  x january  march  x april  june  x july  march  x april  september  x october  december  x january  june  x july  december  x january  thereafter x maximum leverage from the quarter ending through the quarter ending total debt ebitda january  december  x january  june  x july  december  x january  june  x july  december  x january  june  x july  december  x january  thereafter x at december   we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our credit facility 
we are not subject to any minimum net worth covenants 
at december   total debt ebitda ratio  as defined by the credit facility  was and our ebitda interest ratio was ebitda  which is a non gaap measure  used for covenants  is calculated in accordance with the definition in the credit facility agreement 
in this context  ebitda is used solely to provide information on the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to ebitda used by other companies 
failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our credit facility  as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events  would constitute default under the credit agreement and would allow the lenders under the credit facility to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the credit agreement 
this could also have an adverse impact on availability of financial assurances 
in addition  maturity acceleration on the credit facility constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments  including our senior notes and  therefore  these would also be subject to acceleration of maturity 
if such acceleration of maturities of indebtedness were to occur  we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness 
we would likely have to seek an amendment under the credit facility for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity  and or assets sales  if necessary 
we may be unable to amend the credit facility or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated 
prepayments 
under our credit facility  if we generate cash flow in excess of specified levels  we must prepay a portion of our term loan borrowings annually prior to the stated maturity 
to make these payments  if required  we may have to use the revolver to accommodate cash timing differences 
factors primarily increasing excess cash flow  as defined in the credit agreement  could include increases in operating cash flow  lower capital expenditures and working capital requirements  net divestitures or other favorable cash generating activities 
in addition  we are required to make prepayments on the credit facility upon completion of certain transactions as defined in the credit agreement  including asset sales and issuances of debt or equity securities 

table of contents financial assurances 
we are required to provide financial assurances to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping  closure and post closure costs  and or related to our performance under certain collection  landfill and transfer station contracts 
we satisfy the financial assurance requirements by providing performance bonds  letters of credit  insurance policies or trust deposits 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs are determined by the applicable state environmental regulations  which vary by state 
the financial assurance requirements for capping  closure and post closure costs can either be for costs associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill 
generally  states will require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping  closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill 
the amount of financial assurances required can  and generally will  differ from the obligation determined and recorded under gaap 
the amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract 
additionally  we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral required for certain performance obligations 
we do not expect a material increase in financial assurances during  although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change 
at december   we had the following financial assurance instruments and collateral in place in millions landfill closure contract risk casualty collateral for post closure performance insurance obligations total insurance policies surety bonds trust deposits letters of credit total these amounts were issued under the revolver  the incremental revolving letter of credit and the institutional letter of credit facility under our credit facility 
these financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not debt of our company 
since we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments  they are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
however  we record capping  closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance liabilities as they are incurred 
the underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments  in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets  would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations 
we do not expect this to occur 
off balance sheet financing we have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations  other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt 
we have no transactions or obligations with related parties that are not disclosed  consolidated into or reflected in our reported results of operations or financial position 
we do not guarantee any third party debt 
interest rate risk management we believe it is important to have a mix of fixed and floating rate debt to provide financing flexibility 
our policy requires that no less than of our total debt is fixed  either directly or effectively through interest rate swap agreements 
at december   approximately of our debt was fixed  all directly 
from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements for the purpose of hedging variability of interest expense and interest payments on our long term variable rate bank debt and maintaining a mix of fixed and floating rate debt 
our strategy is to use interest rate swap contracts when such transactions will serve to reduce our aggregate exposure and meet the objectives of our interest rate policy 
these contracts are not entered into for trading purposes 
at december   we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding 

table of contents contingencies securities litigation a consolidated amended class action complaint was filed against us and five of our current and former officers on march  in the us district court for the district of arizona  consolidating three lawsuits previously filed on august   august  and september  the amended complaint asserted claims against all defendants under section b of the securities exchange act of and rule b promulgated thereunder and claims against the officers under section a of the securities exchange act 
the complaint alleged that from february  to september   the defendants caused false and misleading statements to be issued in our public filings and public statements regarding our anticipated results for fiscal year the lawsuit sought an unspecified amount of damages 
we filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on may  on december   the us district court for the district of arizona granted our motion and dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice 
plaintiffs have appealed the dismissal to the th circuit court of appeals 
on october  the plaintiffs filed their opening appellate brief 
the company and four individual defendants filed their brief in opposition on december   and the plaintiffs filed their reply brief on january  we do not believe the outcome of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
landfill permitting in september  neighboring parties and the county drainage district filed a civil lawsuit seeking to prevent bfi from obtaining a vertical elevation expansion permit at our acre landfill in donna  texas 
they claimed bfi had agreed not to expand the landfill based on a pre existing settlement agreement from an unrelated dispute years ago related to drainage discharge rights 
in  the tceq granted bfi an expansion permit the administrative expansion permit proceeding  and  based on this expansion permit  the landfill has an estimated remaining capacity of approximately million tons at december  nonetheless  the parties opposing the expansion continued to litigate the civil lawsuit and pursue their efforts in preventing the expansion 
in november  a judgment issued by a texas state trial court in the civil lawsuit effectively revoked the expansion permit that was granted by the tceq in  which would require us to operate the landfill according to a prior permit granted in on appeal  the texas court of appeals stayed the trial court s order  allowing us to continue to place waste in the landfill in accordance with the expansion permit granted in in the administrative expansion proceeding on october   the texas supreme court denied review of the neighboring parties appeal of the expansion permit  thereby confirming that the tceq properly granted our expansion permit 
in april  the texas court of appeals ruled on the civil litigation 
the court dissolved the permanent injunction which would have effectively prevented us from operating the landfill under the expansion permit  but also required us to pay a damage award of approximately million plus attorney fees and interest 
on april   all parties filed motions for rehearing  which were denied by the texas court of appeals 
all parties have filed petitions for review to the texas supreme court 
the texas supreme court has not yet decided if they will grant or deny review 
environmental on march   our wholly owned subsidiary  bfi waste systems of mississippi  llc  received a notice of violation from the environmental protection agency the epa alleging that it was in violation of certain clean air act provisions governing federal emissions guidelines for municipal solid waste landfills  new source performance standards for municipal solid waste landfills  and the facility operating permit at its little dixie landfill 
the majority of these alleged violations involve the failure to file reports or permit applications  including but not limited to design capacity reports  nmoc emission rate reports and collection and control system design plans  with the epa in a timely manner 
if we are found to be in violation of such regulations we may be subject to remedial action under epa regulations  including monetary sanctions of up to  per day 
by letter dated january   the epa notified the company that epa had referred the matter to the us department of justice for purposes bringing an enforcement action and invited the company to engage in settlement negotiations 

table of contents on june   our wholly owned subsidiary  american disposal services of west virginia  inc  received a proposed settlement agreement and consent order from the west virginia department of environmental protection seeking to assess a civil penalty of  and seeking to require the facility to perform a supplemental environmental project sep with a value of not less than  to resolve several alleged environmental violations under the west virginia solid waste management act that occurred over the past three years at its short creek landfill in ohio county  west virginia 
in a settlement agreement and consent order effective september   our subsidiary agreed to pay a civil penalty of  and to perform a sep with a value of not less than  tax we are subject to various federal  state and local tax rules and regulations 
although these rules are extensive and often complex  we are required to interpret and apply them to our transactions 
positions taken in tax filings are subject to challenge by taxing authorities 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities if  upon audit  any positions taken are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
we are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years  including federal income tax audits for calendar years through two significant matters relating to these audits are discussed below 
prior to our acquisition of bfi on july   bfi operating companies  as part of a risk management initiative to effectively manage and reduce costs associated with certain liabilities  contributed assets and existing environmental and self insurance liabilities to six fully consolidated bfi risk management companies rmcs in exchange for stock representing a minority ownership interest in the rmcs 
subsequently  the bfi operating companies sold that stock in the rmcs to third parties at fair market value which resulted in a capital loss of approximately million for tax purposes  calculated as the excess of the tax basis of the stock over the cash proceeds received 
on january   the irs designated this type of transaction and other similar transactions as a potentially abusive tax shelter under irs regulations 
during  the irs proposed the disallowance of all of this capital loss 
at the time of the disallowance  the primary argument advanced by the irs for disallowing the capital loss was that the tax basis of the stock of the rmcs received by the bfi operating companies was required to be reduced by the amount of liabilities assumed by the rmcs even though such liabilities were contingent and  therefore  not liabilities recognized for tax purposes 
under the irs interpretation  there was no capital loss on the sale of the stock since the tax basis of the stock should have approximately equaled the proceeds received 
we protested the disallowance to the appeals office of the irs in august in april  the appeals office of the irs upheld the disallowance of the capital loss deduction 
as a result  in late april we paid a deficiency to the irs of million for bfi tax years prior to the acquisition 
in july  we filed a suit for refund in the united states court of federal claims 
in december  the government filed a counterclaim for assessed interest of million and an assessed penalty of million 
the irs has agreed to suspend the collection of the assessed interest and penalty until a decision is rendered on our suit for refund 
based on the complexity of the case  we estimate it will likely take a number of years to fully try the case and obtain a decision 
furthermore  depending on the circumstances at that time  the losing party may appeal the decision to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
a settlement  however  could occur at any time during the litigation process 
the remaining tax years affected by the capital loss issue are currently being audited or reviewed by the irs 
a decision by the court of federal claims in the pending suit for refund  or by the federal circuit if the case is appealed  should resolve the issue in these years as well 
if we were to win the case  the initial payments would be refunded to us 
if we were to lose the case  the deficiency associated with the remaining tax years would be due 
if we were to settle the case  the settlement would likely cover all affected tax years and any resulting deficiency would become due in the ordinary course of the audits 

table of contents on july   the federal circuit reversed a decision by the court of federal claims favorable to the taxpayer in coltec v 
united states  f 
d fed 
cir 
 in a case involving a similar transaction 
we are not a party to this proceeding 
the federal circuit nonetheless affirmed the taxpayer s position regarding the technical interpretation of the relevant tax code provisions 
although we continue to believe that our suit for refund in the court of federal claims is factually distinguishable from coltec  the legal bases upon which the decision was reached by the federal circuit may impact our litigation 
if the capital loss deduction is fully disallowed  we estimate it could have a potential federal and state cash tax impact excluding penalties of approximately million  of which approximately million has been paid  plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million million net of tax benefit 
additionally  the irs could ultimately impose penalties and interest on those penalties for any amount up to approximately million  after tax 
in april  we exchanged minority partnership interests in four waste to energy facilities for majority partnership interests in equipment purchasing businesses  which are now wholly owned subsidiaries 
the irs is contending that the exchange was a sale on which a corresponding gain should have been recognized 
although we intend to vigorously defend our position on this matter  if the exchange is treated as a sale  we estimate it could have a potential federal and state cash tax impact of approximately million plus accrued interest through december  of approximately million million  net of tax benefit 
also  the irs could propose a penalty of up to of the additional income tax due 
because of several meritorious defenses  we believe the successful assertion of penalties is unlikely 
the potential tax and interest but not penalties or penalty related interest impact of the above matters has been fully reserved on our consolidated balance sheet 
with regard to tax and accrued interest through december   a disallowance would not materially affect our consolidated results of operations  however  a deficiency payment would adversely impact our cash flow in the period the payment was made 
the accrual of additional interest charges through the time these matters are resolved will affect our consolidated results of operations 
in addition  the successful assertion by the irs of penalties could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated liquidity  financial position and results of operations 
indemnification we enter into contracts in the normal course of business that include indemnification clauses 
indemnifications relating to known liabilities are recorded in the consolidated financial statements based on our best estimate of required future payments 
certain of these indemnifications relate to contingent events or occurrences  such as the imposition of additional taxes due to a change in the tax law or adverse interpretation of the tax law  and indemnifications made in divestiture agreements where we indemnify the buyer for liabilities that relate to our activities prior to the divestiture and that may become known in the future 
as of december   we estimated the contingent obligations associated with these indemnifications to be insignificant 
landfill costs subtitle d under rcra and other regulations that apply to the non hazardous solid waste disposal industry have required us  as well as others in the industry  to alter operations and to modify or replace pre subtitle d landfills 
such expenditures have been and will continue to be substantial 
further regulatory changes could accelerate expenditures for closure and post closure monitoring and obligate us to spend sums in addition to those presently reserved for such purposes 
these factors  together with the other factors discussed above  could substantially increase our operating costs and our ability to invest in our facilities

critical accounting judgments and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
the following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our company s financial position and results of operations and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
such critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our reportable segments 
we have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in these accounting policies 
residual accounting and business risk is defined as the inherent risk that we face after the application of our policies and processes and is generally outside of our control 
accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk landfill accounting landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein 
our landfill assets fall into the following two categories  each of which require accounting judgments and estimates landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset as incurred 
landfill retirement obligations that result in an asset when we record our capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
we use the life cycle accounting method for landfills and the related capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
in life cycle accounting  all capitalizable costs to acquire  develop and retire a site are recorded to amortization expense based upon the consumption of disposal capacity 
estimates of future landfill disposal capacity are updated periodically at least annually based on third party aerial surveys 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk landfill development site permit in order to develop  construct and operate a landfill  we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local  state and federal level 
the permitting process requires an initial siting study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations 
the studies are typically prepared by third party consultants and reviewed by our environmental management group 
the initial studies are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
during the development stage we capitalize certain costs prior to the receipt of all required permits 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes in the landfill site permitting process 
these changes could make it more difficult and or costly to obtain a landfill permit 
studies performed by third parties could be inaccurate which could result in the revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions 
conditions could exist that were not identified in the study  which make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the revocation of a permit 
revocation of a permit could materially impair the recorded value of the landfill asset 
actions by neighboring parties  private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain permits could result in revocation or suspension of a permit  which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could materially impair the recorded value of the landfill 
as a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit  improved technical information as a project progresses  or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project  we may decide to reduce the scope or abandon a project which could result in a loss or asset impairment 
technical landfill design upon receipt of initial regulatory approval  technical landfill designs are prepared 
these designs are compiled by third party consultants and reviewed by our environmental management group 
the technical designs include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required 
the technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval 
upon approval of the technical designs  the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design 
these changes could make it more difficult and or costly to meet new design standards 
technical design requirements  as approved  may need modifications at some future point in time 
third party designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs or difficulty in obtaining a permit 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk landfill disposal capacity included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill 
these factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed  the depth of excavation  the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction 
the disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards 
this measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill 
estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements 
the density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions  including waste compaction practices  site design  climate and the nature of the waste 
capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons 
the number of tons cubic yard varies by type of waste 
development costs the types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation  natural and synthetic liners  construction of leachate collection systems  installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes  installation of groundwater monitoring wells  construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site 
we review the adequacy of our cost estimates used in the annual update of development costs by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements  reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs 
these development costs  together with any costs incurred to acquire  design and permit the landfill  including capitalized interest  are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred 
actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the impact from general economic conditions on the availability of the required materials and labor 
technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions  regulatory changes or legislative changes 
landfill development asset amortization in order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations  we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill 
at the end of a landfill s operating life  the landfill asset is fully amortized 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill net book value plus estimated future development costs as described above for the landfill by the landfill s estimated remaining disposal capacity 
the expected future development costs are not inflated and discounted  but rather expressed in nominal dollars 
this rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill and recorded as a charge to amortization expense 
increases and decreases in our future development cost estimates and changes in disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates on a prospective basis 
an unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability in an asset impairment 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill  including acquisition costs  which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values 
we have secured significant landfill assets through business acquisitions in the past and valued them at the time of acquisition based upon market value 
amortization rates are also influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors 
estimate updates on at least an annual basis  we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill 
these costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operation management annually 
changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually 
landfill retirement obligation we have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills capping and closure and post closure monitoring 
landfill capping as individual areas within each landfill reach capacity  we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit 
these requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill siting process described above 
changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping  closure activities or post closure monitoring activities  types and quantities of materials used  or term of post closure care could cause changes in our cost estimates 
closure and post closure monitoring closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste  but prior to being certified as closed 
after the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is closed  we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period  which generally extends for a period of years 
costs associated with closure and post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and monitoring methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems  and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste 
costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling  analysis and statistical reports  third party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance  transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk landfill retirement obligation liability asset estimates of the total future costs required to cap  close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually 
the estimates include inflation  the specific timing of future cash outflows  and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events 
our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation  which is updated annually in both and the present value of the remaining capping costs for a specific capping event and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per ton basis 
these liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill 
capping  closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred 
the retirement obligation is increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liability 
this accretion expense is charged to cost of operations 
actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liability as they are made 
a corresponding retirement obligation asset is recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
the retirement obligation asset is amortized to expense on a per ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed 
the per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the recorded retirement obligation asset net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity 
a per ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event 
closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill 
actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing  causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping  closure and post closure liabilities 
changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities 
changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities  which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities  assets and expense 
changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow  cost estimates or the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations as new information becomes available 
this could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense 
amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design  post closure monitoring requirements  or the inflation or discount rate 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk estimate updates on an annual basis  we update the estimate of future capping  closure and post closure costs and estimates of future disposal capacity for each landfill 
revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping  closure and post closure liabilities and corresponding retirement obligation asset 
changes in the asset resulting in changes to the amortization rates are applied prospectively  except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills  where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed 
disposal capacity as described previously  disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit obtained 
we classify this disposal capacity as permitted 
we also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates  which relate to additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion 
probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the regulatory agencies  but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is highly probable 
our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows we have control of and access to the land where the expansion permit is being sought 
we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local  state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity  or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated  both costs and disposal capacity will change  which will generally increase the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping  closure and post closure accruals 
an unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could cause an asset impairment 
all geological and other technical siting criteria for a landfill have been met or an exception from such requirements has been received or can reasonably be expected to be achieved 
the political process has been assessed and there are no identified impediments that cannot be resolved 
we are actively pursuing the expansion permit and have an expectation that the final local  state and federal permits will be received within the next five years 
senior operation management approval has been obtained 
after successfully meeting these criteria  the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates 
additionally  for purposes of calculating landfill 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk amortization and capping  closure and post closure rates  we include the incremental costs to develop  construct  close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity 
environmental liabilities environmental liabilities arise from contamination existing at our landfills or at third party landfills or other sites that we or a predecessor company have delivered or transported waste to 
these liabilities are based on our estimates of future costs that we will incur for remediation activities and the related litigation costs 
to determine our ultimate liability at these sites  we have used third party environmental engineers and legal counsel to assist in the evaluation of several factors  including the extent of contamination at each identified site  the most appropriate remedy  the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties 
we accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable 
the majority of our environmental liabilities are obligations that we assumed in connection with an acquisition 
any changes in the assumed accruals for environmental liabilities from the amounts recorded by the predecessor are charged or credited to operating expense after one year 
if the liabilities arise through the normal course of business  the accruals are also charged to operating expense 
estimate updates actual settlement of these liabilities could differ from our estimates due to a number of uncertainties  such as the extent of contamination at a particular site  the final remedy  the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties 
actual amounts could differ from the estimated liability as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution including both legal and remedial costs 
an unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to operating expense 
we periodically consult with third party legal counsel and environmental engineers to review the status of all environmental matters and to assist our environmental and legal management in updating our estimates of the likelihood and amounts of remediation 
as the timing of cash payments for these liabilities is uncertain  the liabilities are not discounted 
changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recorded to operating income in the period in which the change in estimate is made 
summary we have determined that the recorded liability for environmental matters as of december  and of approximately million and million  respectively  represents the most probable outcome of these matters 
cash paid for environmental 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk matters during and was million and million  respectively 
we do not expect that adjustments to estimates  which are reasonably possible in the near term and that may result in changes to recorded amounts  will have a material effect on our consolidated liquidity  financial position or results of operations 
however  based on our review of the variability inherent in these estimates  we believe it is reasonably possible that the ultimate outcome of environmental matters  excluding capping  closure and post closure costs  could result in approximately million of additional liability 
due to the nature of these matters  the cash flow impact would not be immediate and would most likely occur over a period greater than five years 
self insurance liabilities and related costs we maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation coverages  ranging from million to million 
our insurance claim liabilities are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet as an accrued liability 
prior to december   we reported our insurance claim liabilities net of amounts due from insurers on claims in excess of the related deductible 
as we are the primary obligor for payment of all claims  we determined that we should report our insurance claim liabilities on a gross basis along with a corresponding amount due from insurers 
as a result of this revision in classification  we have increased our insurance claims reserves as of december  and  by million and million  with a corresponding amount due from our insurers 
this revision in classification had no impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
our insurance claim liabilities are determined by a third party actuary and are based primarily upon our past claims experience  which considers both the frequency and settlement amount of claims 
we use a third party administrator to track and evaluate actual claims experience used in the annual actuarial valuation 
our insurance claim liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of insurance claim liabilities and amounts due from insurers of million and million on our balance sheet 
cash incident rates  including frequency and severity  could increase or decrease during a year causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to increase or decrease 
the settlement costs to discharge our obligations  including legal and health care costs  could increase or decrease causing current and or prior estimates of our self insurance liability to change 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk paid for insurance claims during and was million and million  respectively 
loss contingencies we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote  reasonably possible or probable and whether it can be reasonably estimated 
we analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liability 
management s assessment is developed in consultation with third party legal counsel and other advisors and is based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies 
generally  we record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency 
asset impairment actual costs can vary from estimates for a variety of reasons 
for example  the costs from settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws  opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages 
loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve business matters that are by nature unpredictable 
if a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant amounts  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position in the period or periods in which such judgment or settlement occurs 
valuation methodology we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets 
if we have events or changes in circumstances  including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest assets  certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk evaluation criteria we test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset  a change in its physical condition  or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
recognition criteria if such circumstances arise  we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset  if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
we generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value 
our most significant asset impairment exposure  other than goodwill see discussion below is our investment in landfills 
a significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments and aerial surveys could trigger an impairment charge 
goodwill impairment valuation methodology we evaluate goodwill for impairment based on the estimated fair value of each reporting unit 
we define reporting units as our five geographic operating segments 
we estimate fair value based on projected net cash flows discounted using a weighted average cost of capital  which was approximately in and in in performing this analysis we periodically engage the services of third party consultants 
evaluation criteria the estimated fair value of our reporting units could change with changes in our capital structure  cost of debt  interest rates  actual capital expenditure levels  ability to perform at levels that were forecasted  or the market capitalization of the company 
for example  a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value to below carrying value  which would trigger an impairment charge 
similarly  an increase in our weighted average cost of capital could trigger an impairment charge 
we test goodwill for recoverability on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in legal factors  our liquidity or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  or new circumstances that would cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk recognition criteria we recognize an impairment if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds the related fair value 
at the time of a divestiture of an individual business unit within a reporting unit  goodwill of the reporting unit is allocated to that business unit based on the relative fair value of the unit being disposed to the total fair value of the reporting unit and a gain or loss on disposal is determined 
subsequently  the remaining goodwill in the reporting unit from which the assets were divested is re evaluated for impairment  which could result in an additional loss 
summary in the past  we have incurred non cash losses on sales of business units driven primarily by the goodwill allocated to the business units divested 
if similar divestiture decisions are made in the future  we could incur additional non cash losses 
at december  and  we had recorded goodwill of billion and billion  respectively  all of which was considered to be recoverable from future operations based on estimated future discounted cash flows 
tax accruals we account for income taxes using a balance sheet approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences in financial reporting and income tax bases of assets  other than non deductible goodwill  and liabilities 
the differences are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we utilize outside experts and legal counsel to assist in the development or review of significant tax positions used in establishing our liability 
we provide a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets including net operating loss  capital loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards when it is more likely than not that we will not be able to realize the future benefits giving rise to the deferred tax asset 
we record liabilities for probable tax adjustments proposed or expected by tax authorities at the federal and state level 
the acquisition of bfi in  which was accounted for as a purchase business combination  resulted in approximately billion of goodwill  billion of which is non deductible for tax purposes 
at december   approximately billion of non deductible goodwill remains on our balance sheet 
the balance sheet classification and amount of the tax accounts established relating to acquisitions are based on certain assumptions that could possibly change based on the ultimate outcome of certain tax matters 
as these tax accounts were established in purchase accounting  any future changes relating to these amounts will result in an adjustment to goodwill 
changes in estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to income tax expense 
we are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years 
the internal revenue code irc and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to interpret and apply to our transactions 
positions taken in tax years under examination or subsequent years may be uncertain and are subject to challenge 
accordingly  we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken are disallowed by the taxing authorities 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included herein 
actual income tax rates can vary from period to period as a result of differences between estimated and actual earnings  non deductible items and net operating loss or tax credit utilization 
an increase or decrease in the tax 
table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk income tax expense is recorded on an interim basis based on the expected annual effective tax rate and discrete period items 
the annual effective tax rate is determined using estimated full year earnings  non deductible items and tax credits that are anticipated to be utilized 
summary as of december   we have federal and state net operating loss and minimum tax credit carryforwards with an after tax benefit totaling million most of which will expire if not used 
valuation allowances have been established for the possibility that certain of the state carryforwards may not be used 
rate could have a material impact on our results of operations 
defined benefit pension plans recognition criteria our defined benefit retirement plan was assumed in connection with the acquisition of bfi 
the benefits of approximately of the current plan participants were frozen upon acquisition 
the benefit obligation and associated income or expense is determined by an independent third party actuary based on assumptions we believe are reasonable 
we use a third party to administer the plan and maintain certain data that is provided to the actuary 
the plan assets are managed by a third party that is not affiliated with our actuary 
beginning december   we have recognized a pension asset on our balance sheet for the difference between the fair value of the plan s assets and its projected benefit obligation 
our funding policy is to make annual contributions to the pension plan as determined to be required by the plan s actuary to meet the minimum requirements of the employee retirement income security act erisa and the irc as amended by the pension protection act of no contributions were required during the last three years and no contributions are anticipated for the pension plan s assets are invested as determined by our retirement benefits committee 
at december   approximately of the total plan assets of million  were invested in fixed income bond funds and approximately in equity funds 
changes in the plan s investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and of fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded  the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions 
at december   the plan was over funded by million 

table of contents accounting policy and process residual accounting and use of estimates business risk assumptions the assumptions used in the measurement of the plan s benefit obligations as of september and net periodic pension cost for the following years are summarized below discount rate expected return on plan assets average rate of compensation increase the assumed discount rate is based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the measurement date 
where that timing does not correspond to a published high quality bond rate  the model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate 
our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates 
a decrease in the discount rate will increase our related benefit plan obligation 
the expected return on our plan assets represents a long term view of returns based on our current asset mix 
in developing our expected rate of return assumption  we evaluate long term expected and historical actual returns on the plan assets from our investment managers  which give consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of our plan obligations 
the average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the period benefits are earned and applies only to the portion of the plan that is not frozen 
less than of plan participants continue to earn service benefits 
we annually review our asset allocation  as well as other actuarial assumptions and adjust them as deemed necessary 
our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual return on plan assets varies from the expected returns

table of contents see item a  risk factors  for a description of some of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations reflected in our forward looking statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our variable rate long term debt 
from time to time  to reduce the risk from interest rate fluctuations  we have entered into hedging transactions that have been authorized pursuant to our policies and procedures 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
we currently have no outstanding interest rate swap arrangements at december  increases or decreases in short term market rates did not materially impact cash flow in at december   we have billion of floating rate debt 
if interest rates increased or decreased by basis points  annualized interest expense and cash payments for interest would increase or decrease by approximately million million after tax 
this analysis does not reflect the effect that interest rates would have on other items  such as new borrowings 
see notes and to our consolidated financial statements in this form k for additional information regarding how we manage interest rate risk 
fuel prices 
fuel costs represent a significant operating expense 
historically  we have mitigated fuel cost exposure with fixed price purchase contracts 
a significant portion of these contracts expired in the first quarter of and the remainder in the first quarter of when economically practical  we may enter into new or renewed contracts  or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk 
where appropriate  we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs 
however  while we charge these fees to a majority of our customers  we are unable to charge such fees to all customers 
consequently  an increase in fuel costs results in an increase in our costs of operations  a smaller increase in our revenues from the fuel recovery fee and a decrease in our operating margin percentage  since the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost 
conversely  a decrease in fuel costs results in a decrease in our costs of operations  a smaller decrease in our revenues and an increase in our operating margin percentage 
at our current consumption levels  a one cent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately million million  after tax on an annual basis  which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers 
accordingly  a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenues and costs of operations 
commodities prices 
we market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our material recycling facilities 
as a result  changes in the market prices of these items will impact our results of operations 
revenues from sales of recycled cardboard and newspaper in were approximately million compared to million in
