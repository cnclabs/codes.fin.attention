management believes that by focusing on core values  striving to exceed our clients expectations  being an employer of choice and providing exceptional value to shareholders  the corporation can achieve the profitability and growth goals it has set for itself 
existing markets and expansion during  first charter implemented a growth strategy intended to both expand the first charter footprint into high growth markets and to optimize existing locations through attracting new customers and retaining existing customers 
as part of the strategic growth strategy  first charter has expanded operations into the raleigh  north carolina  metro area 
the raleigh metro area is expected to have at or above average household income and growth rates relative to the north carolina and national averages 
first charter opened a loan production office in raleigh in early  which was later consolidated into the corporation s first financial center in raleigh in october first charter also added three new financial centers in the raleigh market in february by opening new financial centers in raleigh  cary  and garner  north carolina 
these financial centers offer businesses and individuals a broad range of financial services  including banking  financial planning  wealth management  investments  insurance  and mortgages 
first charter also operates atms in the raleigh market 
during late  the corporation entered the greater atlanta  georgia metropolitan market with the acquisition of gbc and its banking subsidiary  gwinnett bank  with financial centers located in lawrenceville and alpharetta  georgia 
by expanding into the greater atlanta metropolitan market through this acquisition  the corporation has been able to spread its credit risk over multiple market areas and states  as well as gain access to another large market area as a source for core deposits 
the counties in which gwinnett bank operates boast some of the strongest demographic growth trends in the nation  and the median household income in these counties is significantly higher than the median income for georgia and the southeast 
during  the corporation also opened two new replacement financial centers in lincolnton and denver  north carolina  providing an even greater level of service and convenience for customers in those markets 
financial centers in bryson city and sylva were sold in september  bringing the total number of financial centers to at december  recent challenges during the fourth quarter of  the corporation closed two significant transactions  the acquisition of gbc and the sale of southeastern employee benefits services sebs  its employee benefits administration business 
in addition  the corporation was faced with several new accounting standards 
the numerous challenges that these events posed for the corporation were compounded by a key vacancy in the leadership of its accounting area and turnover within other key finance positions  and exposed certain material weaknesses in the corporation s internal control over financial reporting  discussed in this report in item a 
controls and procedures 

table of contents during the months following the fiscal year end  the corporation was engaged in a detailed assessment of its internal controls and focused considerable time and resources on the adoption and implementation of various accounting pronouncements and the analysis of their impact on its financial results 
in addition  the audit committee of the board of directors commenced and concluded an inquiry regarding certain accounting policies and estimates  principally related to the corporation s acquisition of gbc  compensation matters  and related controls and procedures 
as previously disclosed  none of the findings of the audit committee inquiry were financially material  and did not result in the corporation restating any of its historical financial statements 
however  these events caused a significant delay in the completion of the corporation s financial statements  their audit by the corporation s outside auditors and  in turn  the filing of this report 
as the corporation turns its focus to  management is committed to the improvement of its financial infrastructure to support its growth strategy 
it has begun to implement a remediation plan to address the material weaknesses in the corporation s internal controls and is in the process of developing specific plans to address the findings and recommendations resulting from the audit committee inquiry and to implement additional appropriate controls and procedures 
financial summary net income was million  or per diluted share  for  a million increase from net income of million  or per diluted share  for return on average assets and return on average equity was percent and percent for  respectively  compared to percent and percent for  respectively 
during and  several material transactions occurred  which impacted noninterest income and expense 
in  these transactions included the sale of the corporation s employee benefits administration business  the sale of two financial centers  distributions received from the corporation s equity method investments  the further repositioning of the corporation s securities portfolio  the restructuring of the corporation s boli investment  the acceleration of vesting on all stock options granted from to  the separation expense for certain employees  and the merger costs associated with the acquisition of gbc 
during  these transactions included the initial repositioning of the corporation s securities portfolio  early termination of derivatives and their associated hedged debt instruments  early extinguishment of debt  the expense associated with the retirement of a key executive  and the modification of a legacy employee benefit plan 
earnings analysis for fourth quarter versus fourth quarter for the fourth quarter of  net income was million  or per diluted share  compared to a net loss of million  or per diluted share  for the fourth quarter 
the fourth quarter of was adversely affected by several items  including million in expense incurred from the accelerated vesting of equity options  million in merger related expense  million in employee separation expense 
the million gain recognized on the sale of sebs was principally offset by the income tax expense on the gain 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation repositioned and de leveraged its balance sheet by selling securities and extinguishing debt in an on going effort to improve first charter s earnings quality and stability 
as a result of executing these initiatives  the corporation realized an approximate million pre tax million after tax charge in the fourth quarter of on december   the corporation completed the sale of sebs to an independent third party for million in cash 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of  because the goodwill and certain of the intangible assets were nondeductible for tax purposes  the applicable income tax expense associated with the gain was  in connection with this sale  the corporation and the purchaser entered into a three year agreement under which the corporation will continue to use the purchaser as the strategic record keeping partner for its wealth management clients and the administration of certain of the corporation s employee benefits plans 
financial results for sebs  the sole component of the corporation s employee benefits administration business  including the gain  are reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents the net interest margin taxable equivalent net interest income divided by average earning assets increased basis points to percent in the fourth quarter of from percent in the fourth quarter of the margin improvement benefited  in part  from the addition of gbc s higher margin balance sheet and the continued benefits from previously disclosed balance sheet repositionings in the fourth quarter of and the third quarter of net interest income increased to million  representing a million  or percent  increase over the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of  earning asset yields increased basis points to percent 
this increase was driven by two factors 
first  loan yields increased basis points to percent and securities yields increased basis points to percent 
second  the mix of higher yielding loan assets improved as a result of the gbc acquisition  the balance sheet repositionings  and a smaller percentage of lower yielding mortgage loans 
the percentage of investment security average balances which  on average  have lower yields than loans to total earning asset average balances was reduced from percent to percent over the prior year 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points during the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of this was comprised of a basis point increase in interest bearing deposit costs to percent  while other borrowing costs increased basis points to percent 
during this period  the federal reserve raised the rate that banks can lend funds to each other the fed funds rate by basis points 
also  as a result of the balance sheet repositionings  the percentage of higher cost other borrowings average balances was reduced from percent to percent of total interest bearing liabilities average balances over the prior year 
the provision for loan losses was million for the fourth quarter of  compared to million for the fourth quarter of  reflecting improved credit quality trends  including lower net charge offs 
net charge offs were  for the fourth quarter of  or of average portfolio loans  compared to million for the fourth quarter of  or of average portfolio loans 
historical noninterest income amounts have been restated to reflect the effect of reporting the previously announced sale of sebs as a discontinued operation 
noninterest income from continuing operations totaled million  compared to a loss of million for the fourth quarter of driving the noninterest loss for the fourth quarter were securities losses of million from the balance sheet repositioning  versus no gains or losses recognized in the fourth quarter 
excluding these securities losses  noninterest income increased million  or percent  to million 
of this increase  million was attributable to the gbc acquisition  which closed on november  deposit service charges  atm  debit card  and merchant fees  and mortgage  brokerage  insurance  and wealth management revenue were all contributors to growth in the corporation s noninterest income 
partially offsetting the growth in these key areas were million less in gains from property sales in the fourth quarter  compared to the fourth quarter 
historical noninterest expense amounts have been restated to reflect the effect of reporting the sale of sebs as a discontinued operation 
on a year over year basis  total noninterest expense from continuing operations for the fourth quarter decreased million to million  compared to million for the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter included approximately million of expense related to the previously discussed balance sheet repositioning 
raleigh related expense totaled million during the fourth quarter  compared to million in the fourth quarter of salaries and employee benefits expense increased million  compared to the fourth quarter of  principally attributable to general overall compensation increases  including million in gbc personnel related expenses  million from raleigh personnel expense and investment  and an additional million from equity based compensation  including option acceleration expense  and million in severance expense 
occupancy and equipment expense for the fourth quarter increased million and included incremental expense from a new loan platform being placed in service during the quarter and million of incremental raleigh related costs during the quarter  whereas occupancy and equipment expense for the fourth quarter included a million reduction of expense due to a 
table of contents correction related to the corporation s fixed asset records 
marketing expense declined million  compared to the year ago quarter 
foreclosed properties expense increased by million  and amortization of intangible assets also increased by million due to core deposit intangible amortization from the gbc acquisition 
the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of was percent  compared with percent in the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter was significantly affected by charges incurred for the previously mentioned balance sheet repositioning  while the fourth quarter was adversely affected by the tax gain recognized from the sale of sebs and additional revenue related to the gbc acquisition 
the effective tax rate for both quarters includes the effects of both continuing and discontinued operations

table of contents critical accounting estimates and policies the corporation s significant accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements and are essential in understanding management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
some of the corporation s accounting policies require significant judgment to estimate values of either assets or liabilities 
in addition  certain accounting principles require significant judgment in applying the complex accounting principles to complicated transactions to determine the most appropriate treatment 
the following is a summary of the more judgmental estimates and complex accounting principles 
in many cases  there are numerous alternative judgments that could be used in the process of estimating values of assets or liabilities 
where alternatives exist  the corporation has used the factors that it believes represent the most reasonable value in developing the inputs for the valuation 
actual performance that differs from the corporation s estimates of the key variables could impact net income 
allowance for loan losses the corporation considers its policy regarding the allowance for loan losses to be one of its most critical accounting policies  as it requires some of management s most subjective and complex judgments 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level the corporation believes is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
the corporation has developed appropriate policies and procedures for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses that reflect its evaluation of credit risk considering all information available to it 
the determination of the level of the allowance and  correspondingly  the provision for loan losses  rests upon various judgments and assumptions  including i general economic conditions  ii loan portfolio composition  iii prior loan loss experience  iv management s evaluation of credit risk related to both individual borrowers and pools of loans and v observations derived from the corporation s ongoing internal credit review and examination processes and those of its regulators 
depending on changes in circumstances  future assessments of credit risk may yield materially different results  which may require an increase or decrease in the allowance for loan losses 
the corporation employs a variety of statistical modeling and estimation tools in developing the appropriate allowance 
the following provides a description of each of the components involved in the allowance for loan losses  the techniques the corporation uses  and the estimates and judgments inherent to each component 
the first component of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation allowance for impaired loans  is computed based on documented reviews performed by the corporation s credit risk management for impaired commercial relationships greater than  credit risk management typically estimates these valuation allowances by considering the fair value of the underlying collateral for each impaired loan using current appraisals 
the results of these estimates are updated quarterly or periodically as circumstances change 
changes in the dollar amount of impaired loans or in the estimates of the fair value of the underlying collateral can impact the valuation allowance on impaired loans and  therefore  the overall allowance for loan losses 
the second component of the allowance for loan losses  the portion attributable to all other loans without specific reserve amounts  is determined by applying reserve factors to the outstanding balance of loans 
the portfolio is segmented into two major categories commercial loans and consumer loans 
commercial loans are segmented further by risk grade  so that separate reserve factors are applied to each pool of commercial loans 
the reserve factors applied to the commercial segments are determined using a migration analysis that computes current loss estimates by credit grade using a month trailing loss history 
since the migration analysis is based on trailing data  the reserve factors may change based on actual losses and other judgmentally determined factors 
changes in commercial loan credit grades can also impact this component of the allowance for loan losses from period to period 
consumer loans which include mortgage  general consumer  consumer real estate  home equity and consumer unsecured loans are segmented by loan type and by collateral grouping in order to apply separate reserve factors to each pool of consumer loans 
the reserve factors applied to the consumer segments are a month 
table of contents rolling average of losses 
since the reserve factors are based on historical data  the percentage loss estimates can change based on actual losses 
the third component of the allowance for loan losses is intended to capture the various risk elements of the loan portfolio which may not be sufficiently captured in the historical loss rates 
these factors currently include intrinsic risk  operational risk  concentration risk and model risk 
intrinsic risk relates to the impact of current economic conditions on the corporation s borrower base  the effects of which may not be realized by the corporation in the form of charge offs for several periods 
the corporation monitors and documents various local  regional and national economic data  and makes subjective estimates of the impact of changes in economic conditions on the allowance for loan losses 
operational risk includes factors such as the likelihood of loss on a loan due to procedural error 
historically  the corporation has made additional loss estimates for certain types of loans that were either acquired from other institutions in mergers or were underwritten using policies that are no longer in effect at the corporation 
these identified loans are considered to have higher risk of loss than currently reflected in historical loss rates of the corporation  so additional estimates of loss are made by management 
concentration risk includes the risk of loss due to extensions of credit to a particular industry  loan type or borrower that may be troubled 
model risk reflects the inherent uncertainty of estimates within the allowance for loan losses model 
the corporation monitors its portfolio for any excessive concentrations of loans during each period  and if any excessive concentrations are noted  additional estimates of loss are made 
changes in the allowance for loan losses for these subjective factors can arise from changes in the balance and types of outstanding loans  as well as changes in the underlying conditions which drive a change in the percentage used 
as more fully discussed below  the corporation continually monitors the portfolio in an effort to identify any other factors which may have an impact on loss estimates within the portfolio 
all estimates of the loan portfolio risk  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  are subject to general and local economic conditions  among other factors  which are unpredictable and beyond the corporation s control 
since a significant portion of the loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans and loans to area businesses  the corporation is subject to continued risk that the real estate market and economic conditions in general could change and therefore result in additional losses and require increases in the provision for loan losses 
if management had made different assumptions about probable loan losses  the corporation s financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
for additional discussion concerning the corporation s allowance for loan losses and related matters  see allowance for loan losses 
income taxes calculating the corporation s income tax expense requires significant judgment and the use of estimates 
the corporation periodically assesses its tax positions based on current tax developments  including enacted statutory  judicial and regulatory guidance 
in analyzing the corporation s overall tax position  consideration is given to the amount and timing of recognizing income tax liabilities and benefits 
in applying the tax and accounting guidance to the facts and circumstances  income tax balances are adjusted appropriately through the income tax provision 
reserves for income tax uncertainties are maintained at levels the corporation believes are adequate to absorb probable payments 
actual amounts paid  if any  could differ significantly from these estimates 
identified intangible assets and goodwill the corporation records all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions  including goodwill  indefinite lived intangibles  and other intangibles  at fair value as required by sfas  business combinations 
the initial recording of goodwill and other intangibles requires subjective judgments concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities 
the corporation is in the process of finalizing valuations of certain assets and liabilities  including intangible assets  for the november   acquisition of gbc 
consequently  the allocation of the purchase price and the resulting goodwill are subject to refinement after the reported balance sheet date 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to annual tests for impairment or more often if events or circumstances indicate they may be impaired 
other identified intangible assets are amortized 
table of contents over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying amount 
the ongoing value of goodwill is ultimately supported by revenue from the corporation s businesses and its ability to deliver cost effective services over future periods 
any decline in revenue resulting from a lack of growth or the inability to effectively provide services could potentially create an impairment of goodwill 
earnings performance first charter corporation s net income was million for  compared to million for earnings were per diluted share  an increase of cents per diluted share from a year ago 
total revenue increased percent to million  compared to million a year ago 
the increase in revenue was primarily driven by two factors 
first  noninterest income from continuing operations  excluding securities losses in both and  increased million  or percent  due to higher deposit service charges  atm  debit card  and merchant fees  and insurance and mortgage revenue combined with the recognition in of million of gains on equity method investments and a million gain on the sale of loans and deposits 
second  net interest income increased million to million as the net interest margin expanded basis points to percent 
the improvement in net interest income and the margin was largely attributable to the corporation s previously discussed balance sheet repositioning initiatives undertaken in the fourth quarter of and the third quarter of  along with the addition of gbc s higher margin balance sheet in the fourth quarter of noninterest expense from continuing operations  excluding debt extinguishment and derivative termination costs in  increased million to million  largely due to higher salaries and benefits and increased occupancy and equipment expense 
contributing to both of these expense categories were incremental costs associated with the gbc acquisition  costs of the corporation s raleigh investment  and stock based compensation  including the accelerated vesting of options 
loan growth was strong  as average balances increased million  or percent  compared to the majority of the increase is attributable to strong growth in the raleigh and charlotte markets 
additionally  million of this growth was attributable to the gbc acquisition 
average deposits for increased million  or percent  compared to of the growth  million was related to the gbc acquisition 
credit quality continues to be solid  with net charge offs of percent of average portfolio loans in  compared to percent in at december   raleigh related loans and deposits totaled million and million  respectively 
net interest income and margin net interest income  the difference between total interest income and total interest expense  is the corporation s principal source of earnings 
an analysis of the corporation s net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis and average balance sheets for the last three years is presented in table two 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis fte is a non gaap generally accepted accounting principles performance measure used by management in operating the business which management believes provides investors with a more accurate picture of the interest margin for comparative purposes 
the changes in net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis from year to year are analyzed in table three 
the discussion below is based on net interest income computed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
for  net interest income was million  an increase of million  or percent  from net interest income of million in the net interest margin expanded basis points to percent in from percent in the margin improvement benefited  in part  from the addition of gbc s higher margin balance sheet and the continued benefits from the previously disclosed balance sheet repositionings in the fourth quarter of and the third quarter of  partially offset by a somewhat more competitive deposit pricing environment and home equity loan attrition as a result of customers refinancing adjustable rate home equity loans into fixed rate first mortgage loans 
since the balance sheet repositioning occurred in late october  the benefit to the net interest margin for was minimal 

table of contents compared to  earning asset yields increased basis points to percent 
this increase was driven by two factors 
first  loan yields increased basis points to percent and securities yields increased basis points to percent 
second  the mix of higher yielding loan assets improved as a result of the gbc acquisition  the balance sheet repositionings  and a smaller percentage of lower yielding mortgage loans 
the percentage of investment security average balances which  on average  have lower yields than loans to total earning asset average balances was reduced from percent to percent over the past year 
earning asset average balances decreased million to billion at december   compared to nearly billion for the decrease was due to a decline of million average securities balance  resulting from the sale and maturity of securities in the corporation s portfolio  consistent with the corporation s balance sheet repositioning 
this decline was partially offset by growth in the corporation s average loan balances  which increased million  compared to loan balances increased principally due to strong growth in the charlotte and raleigh markets and to a lesser extent  due to the purchase of gbc during the fourth quarter of  which contributed million to average loans and loans held for sale 
on the liability side of the balance sheet  the cost of interest bearing liabilities increased basis points  compared to this increase was comprised of a basis point increase in interest bearing deposit costs to percent  while other borrowing costs increased basis points to percent 
during the past year  the federal reserve raised the rate that banks can lend funds to each other the fed funds rate by basis points 
also  as a result of the balance sheet repositionings  the percentage of higher cost other borrowings average balances was reduced from percent to percent of interest bearing liabilities average balances over the past year 
the corporation s primary interest rate risk management objective is to maximize net interest income across a broad range of interest rate scenarios  subject to risk tolerance limits set by management and the board of directors 
as previously discussed  the corporation repositioned its balance sheet in the fourth quarter of and the third quarter of the corporation expects these repositionings of the balance sheet to continue to improve net interest income and the net interest margin and reduce interest rate risk

incentive based compensation contributed million toward the increase in salaries and employee benefits expense for these increases were partially offset by a million expense associated with a legacy employee benefit plan in the second quarter of  which did not recur in  along with a million favorable actuarial revision to a medical reserve recognized in the third quarter of  and a million favorable reduction in the medical claims ibnr in the second quarter of separation expense was million in  versus million in in connection with the former cfo s retirement in early occupancy and equipment expense increased million due to additional financial center lease and depreciation costs  of which approximately million was related to additional raleigh financial centers 

table of contents these increases were partially offset by certain corporate fixed assets becoming fully depreciated in the third and fourth quarters of and no longer being expensed 
further adding to the variance between years was a million reduction in occupancy and equipment in due to a correction related to the corporation s fixed asset records 
professional services expense rose million  reflecting an increase in outsourced services over data processing expense increased million as a result of increased transaction volume

the lower effective tax rate in was primarily attributable to the decrease in income  principally resulting from the balance sheet repositioning  relative to nontaxable adjustments 
the effective tax rate for both years was lowered by the reduction in previously accrued taxes due to reduced risk on certain tax contingencies

table of contents balance sheet analysis securities available for sale the securities portfolio  all of which is classified as available for sale  is a component of the corporation s asset liability management alm strategy 
the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon liquidity needs  changes in interest rates  changes in the bank s risk tolerance  the composition of the rest of the balance sheet  and other factors 
securities available for sale are accounted for at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded net of tax as a component of other comprehensive income in shareholders equity unless the unrealized losses are considered other than temporary 
the fair value of the securities portfolio is determined by various third party sources 
the valuation is determined as of a date within close proximity to the end of the reporting period based on available quoted market prices or quoted market prices for similar securities if a quoted market price is not available 
at december   securities available for sale were million  compared to million at december  pretax unrealized net losses on securities available for sale were million at december   compared to pretax unrealized net losses of million at december  the recognition of million of losses during on the sale of million of securities  along with the aging of existing securities led to the reduction in the unrealized losses between december  and december  the unrealized losses in the securities portfolio have primarily resulted from the rise in interest rates over the past few years 
the corporation has been purchasing shorter duration securities with more predictable cash flows in a variety of interest rate scenarios as part of its overall balance sheet management 
during  proceeds from the aforementioned sale of securities  along with maturities  paydowns  and calls were used to purchase million of securities  principally mortgage and asset backed securities 
the asset backed securities purchased are collateralized debt obligations  representing securitizations of financial company capital securities and were purchased for portfolio risk diversification and their higher yields

pricing is driven by quality  loan size  loan tenor  prepayment risk  the corporation s relationship with the customer  competition  and other factors 
the corporation is primarily a secured lender in all of these loan categories 
the terms of the corporation s loans are generally five years or less with the exception of home equity lines and residential mortgages  for which the terms can range out to years 
in addition  the corporation has a 
table of contents program in which it buys and sells portions of loans primarily originated in the southeastern region of the united states  both participations and syndications  from key strategic partner financial institutions with which the corporation has established relationships 
this strategic partners portfolio includes commercial real estate  commercial non real estate  and construction loans 
this program enables the corporation to diversify both its geographic risk and its total exposure risk 
from time to time  the corporation also sources commercial real estate  commercial non real estate  construction  and consumer loans through correspondent relationships 
as of december   the corporation s total loan portfolio included million of loans originated through the strategic partners program and correspondent relationships 
commercial non real estate the corporation s commercial non real estate lending program is generally targeted to serve small to middle market businesses with annual sales of million or less in the corporation s geographic area 
commercial lending includes commercial  financial  agricultural and industrial loans 
pricing on commercial non real estate loans is usually tied to widely recognized market indexes  such as the prime rate  the london interbank offer rate libor  the us dollar interest rate swap curve  or rates on us treasury securities 
commercial real estate similar to commercial non real estate lending  the corporation s commercial real estate lending program is generally targeted to serve small to middle market businesses with annual sales of million or less in the corporation s geographic area 
the real estate loans are both owner occupied and project related 
construction real estate construction loans include both commercial and residential construction  together with construction permanent loans  which are intended to convert to permanent loans upon completion of the construction project 
loans for commercial construction are usually to in market developers  builders  businesses  individuals or real estate investors for the construction of commercial structures primarily in the corporation s market area 
loans are made for purposes including  but not limited to  the construction of industrial facilities  apartments  shopping centers  office buildings  homes and warehouses 
the properties may be constructed for sale  lease or owner occupancy 
mortgage the corporation originates one to four family residential mortgage loans throughout its footprint and through loan origination offices in reston  virginia 
from time to time  the corporation has purchased arm loans in other market areas through a correspondent relationship 
at december   loans purchased through this relationship represented million  or percent  of the total mortgage loan portfolio 
the majority of the purchased loans consist of interest only arms  which currently reprice in to years 
no mortgage loans have been purchased since the first quarter of the corporation offers a full line of products  including conventional  conforming  and jumbo fixed rate and adjustable rate mortgages  which are originated and sold into the secondary market  however  from time to time a portion of this production is retained and then serviced through a third party arrangement 
consumer the corporation offers a wide variety of consumer loan products 
various types of secured and unsecured loans are marketed to qualifying existing customers and to other creditworthy candidates in the corporation s market area 
unsecured loans  including revolving credits eg  checking account overdraft protection and personal lines of credit are provided and various installment loan products such as unimproved lot loans as well as vehicle and marine loans are also offered 

table of contents home equity home equity loans and lines are secured by first and second liens on the borrower s residential real estate 
as with all consumer lending  home equity loans are centrally decisioned and documented to ensure the underwriting conforms to the corporate lending policy 
the table below summarizes loans in the classifications indicated 
table ten loan portfolio composition for the calendar year in thousands commercial real estate commercial non real estate construction mortgage home equity consumer total portfolio loans allowance for loan losses unearned income portfolio loans  net gross loans increased million  or percent  to billion at december   compared to billion at december  a major component of the growth in loans was the acquisition of gbc  which accounted for million of the growth from year end excluding the gbc acquisition  commercial and construction loans grew million  or nearly percent 
mortgage loans declined by million  or percent  due in part to normal loan amortization  and the decline is consistent with the corporation s strategy of selling the bulk of the new mortgage loan originations into the secondary market rather than retaining the loans on its balance sheet 
home equity loans declined million  partly as a result of customers refinancing adjustable rate home equity loans into fixed rate first mortgage loans 
consumer loans increased million  of which million is attributable to the gbc acquisition  with the remainder attributable to organic growth 
also affecting loan balances was an million reduction of loans  primarily consumer loans  sold in connection with the previously mentioned sale of two financial centers in in late and early  the corporation expanded into the raleigh  north carolina market with four de novo financial centers 
at december   the corporation s loans included million  principally commercial and construction loans  from the raleigh market 
the mix of variable rate  adjustable rate and fixed rate loans is incorporated into the corporation s alm strategy 
as of december   of the billion loan portfolio  billion were tied to variable interest rates  billion were fixed rate loans  and billion were arms with an initial fixed rate period after which the loan rate floats on a predetermined schedule 
during the third quarter of  approximately million of consumer loans secured by real estate were transferred from the consumer loan category to the home equity million and mortgage million loan categories to make the balance sheet presentation more consistent with bank regulatory definitions 
the balance sheet transfer had no effect on credit reporting  underwriting  reported results of operations  or liquidity 
prior period end balances have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation 
total loan average balances for increased million  or percent  to billion  compared to billion for commercial loan growth drove the increase  rising by million  or percent  of which million was attributable to the gbc acquisition 
the remainder reflected continued robust 
table of contents organic commercial lending in the charlotte and raleigh markets 
consumer loan average balances  including home equity  increased million and mortgage loan average balances decreased million 
the decline in mortgage loan balances was due to normal loan amortization and first charter s strategy of selling most of its new mortgage production in the secondary market 
gbc had no residential mortgages on its balance sheet at the time of the acquisition 
cash flow from mortgage loan runoff contributed to financing higher yielding commercial loans 
in late september  first charter s previously announced sale of two financial centers was completed 
this sale reduced total loan average balances nominally for the year 
deposits a summary of deposits follows table eleven deposits december in thousands noninterest bearing demand interest bearing demand money market accounts savings deposits certificates of deposit total deposits deposit growth  particularly low cost transaction or core deposit growth money market  demand  and savings accounts  continues to be an area of emphasis for the corporation 
for  core deposit balances increased million  or percent  compared year end this includes the impact of first charter s sale of two financial centers in september  which included the sale of million of core deposits 
approximately million of the core deposit balance growth was attributable to the gbc acquisition 
the total core deposit increase was primarily driven by a million  or percent  increase in money market balances  a million  or percent  increase in interest checking balances  and a million  or percent  increase in noninterest bearing demand deposit balances  slightly offset by an million  or percent  decrease in savings balances 
of these increases  gbc contributed approximately million to money market deposit balances  million to interest checking and saving balances  and million to noninterest bearing demand deposit balances 
certificates of deposit cds also grew million  of which million was attributable to the gbc acquisition 
overall  retail cds increased million and brokered cds increased million 
customers exhibited a strong preference for certificates of deposit during  as cds offered more attractive returns in s higher interest rate environment than had existed in recent years 
other borrowings other borrowings consist of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreement to repurchase  commercial paper and other short term borrowings  and long term borrowings 
federal funds purchased represent unsecured overnight borrowings from other financial institutions by the bank 
at december   the bank had federal funds back up lines of credit totaling million with million outstanding  compared to similar lines of credit totaling million with million outstanding at december  securities sold under agreements to repurchase represent short term borrowings by the bank with maturities less than one year collateralized by a portion of the corporation s united states government or agency securities 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase totaled million at december   compared to million at december  these borrowings are an important source of funding to the corporation 
access to alternate short term funding sources allows the corporation to meet funding needs without relying on increasing deposits on a short term basis 

table of contents first charter corporation issues commercial paper as another source of short term funding 
it is purchased primarily by the bank s commercial deposit clients 
commercial paper outstanding at december  was million  compared to million at december  other short term borrowings consist of the fhlb borrowings with an original maturity of one year or less 
fhlb borrowings are collateralized by securities from the corporation s investment portfolio  and a blanket lien on certain qualifying commercial and single family loans held in the corporation s loan portfolio 
at december   the bank and gwinnett bank collectively had million of short term fhlb borrowings  compared to the bank s million at december  in addition  the corporation had a million bank credit line that was not drawn upon at december  no comparable line existed at december  the corporation  in its overall management of interest rate risk  is opportunistic in evaluating alternative funding sources  while balancing the funding needs of the corporation  it considers the duration of available maturities  the relative attractiveness of funding costs  and the diversification of funding sources  among other factors  in order to maintain flexibility in the nature of deposits and borrowings the corporation holds at any given time 
as part of the balance sheet repositioning in  the corporation extinguished million of short term debt  primarily with the fhlb  which had an average floating rate of fed funds plus basis points  or approximately percent at the time of prepayment 
long term borrowings represent fhlb borrowings with original maturities greater than one year and subordinated debentures related to trust preferred securities 
at december   the bank had million of long term fhlb borrowings  compared to million at december  in addition  the corporation had million of subordinated debentures at december  and the corporation formed first charter capital trust i and first charter capital trust ii  in june and september  respectively  both are wholly owned business trusts 
first charter capital trust i and first charter capital trust ii issued million and million  respectively  of trust preferred securities that were sold to third parties 
the proceeds of the sale of the trust preferred securities were used to purchase subordinated debentures from the corporation  which are presented as long term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet and qualify for inclusion in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes  subject to certain limitations

table of contents credit risk management the corporation s credit risk policy and procedures are centralized for every loan type 
in addition  all mortgage  consumer  and home equity loans are centrally decisioned 
all loans generally flow through an independent closing unit to ensure proper documentation 
loans originated by the corporation s atlanta based lenders are currently being processed and closed independently from the corporation s centralized credit structure 
finally  all known collection or problem loans are centrally managed by experienced workout personnel 
to monitor the effectiveness of policies and procedures  management maintains a set of asset quality standards for past due  nonaccrual  and watchlist loans and monitors the trends of these standards over time 
these standards are approved by the board of directors and reviewed quarterly with the board of directors for compliance 
loan administration and underwriting the bank s chief risk officer is responsible for the continuous assessment of the bank s risk profile as well as making any necessary adjustments to policies and procedures 
commercial loan relationships of less than  may be approved by experienced commercial loan officers  within their loan authority 
commercial and commercial real estate loans are approved by signature authority requiring at least two experienced officers for relationships greater than  the exceptions to this include city executives and certain senior loan officers who are authorized to approve relationships up to million 
an independent risk manager is involved in the approval of commercial and commercial real estate relationships that exceed million 
all relationships greater than million receive a comprehensive annual review by either the senior credit analysts or lending officers of the bank  which is then reviewed by the independent risk managers and or the final approval officer with the appropriate signature authority 
relationships totaling million or more are further reviewed by senior lending officers of the bank  the chief risk officer  and the credit risk management committee comprised of certain executive and senior management 
in addition  relationships totaling million or more are reviewed by the board of directors credit and compliance committee 
these oversight committees provide policy  process  product and specific relationship direction to the lending personnel 
as of december   the corporation had a legal lending limit of million and a general target lending limit of million per relationship 
the corporation s loan portfolio consists of loans made for a variety of commercial and consumer purposes 
because commercial loans are made based to a great extent on the corporation s assessment of a borrower s income  cash flow  character and ability to repay  such loans are viewed as involving a higher degree of credit risk than is the case with residential mortgage loans or consumer loans 
to manage this risk  the corporation s commercial loan portfolio is managed under a defined process which includes underwriting standards and risk assessment  procedures for loan approvals  loan grading  ongoing identification and management of credit deterioration and portfolio reviews to assess loss exposure and to ascertain compliance with the corporation s credit policies and procedures 
during  the corporation implemented a new consumer loan platform to improve servicing for customers by providing loan officers with additional tools and real time access to credit bureau information at the time of loan application 
this platform also delivers increased reporting capabilities and improved credit risk management by having the corporation s policies embedded into the decision process while also managing approval authority limits for credit exposure and reporting 
in general  consumer loans including mortgage and home equity have a lower risk profile than commercial loans 
commercial loans including commercial real estate  commercial non real estate and construction loans are generally larger in size and more complex than consumer loans 
commercial real estate loans are deemed less risky than commercial non real estate and construction loans  because the collateral value of real estate generally maintains its value better than non real estate or construction collateral 
consumer loans  which are smaller in size and more geographically diverse across the corporation s entire primary market area  provide risk diversity across the portfolio 
because mortgage loans are secured by first liens on the consumer s residential real estate  they are the corporation s lowest 
table of contents risk profile loan type 
home equity loans are deemed less risky than unsecured consumer loans  as home equity loans and lines are secured by first or second deeds of trust on the borrower s residential real estate 
a centralized decision making process is in place to control the risk of the consumer  home equity  and mortgage loan portfolio 
the consumer real estate appraisal process is also centralized relative to appraisal engagement  appraisal review  and appraiser quality assessment 
these processes are detailed in the underwriting guidelines  which cover each retail loan product type from underwriting  servicing  compliance issues and closing procedures 
at december   the substantial majority of the total loan portfolio  including the commercial and real estate portfolio  represented loans to borrowers within the metro regions of charlotte and raleigh  north carolina and atlanta  georgia 
the diverse economic base of these regions tends to provide a stable lending environment  however  an economic downturn in the charlotte region  the corporation s primary market area  could adversely affect its business 
no significant concentration of credit risk has been identified due to the diverse industrial base in this region 
additionally  the corporation s loan portfolio consists of certain non traditional loan products 
some of these products include interest only loans  loans with initial interest rates that are below the market interest rate for the initial period of the loan term and may increase when that period ends and loans with a high loan to value ratio 
based on the corporation s assessment  these products do not give rise to a concentration of credit risk 
derivatives credit risk associated with derivatives is measured as the net replacement cost should the counter parties with contracts in a gain position to the corporation fail to perform under the terms of those contracts after considering recoveries of underlying collateral and netting agreements 
in managing derivative credit risk  both the current exposure  which is the replacement cost of contracts on the measurement date  as well as an estimate of the potential change in value of contracts over their remaining lives are considered 
to minimize credit risk  the corporation may enter into legally enforceable master netting agreements  which reduce risk by permitting the closeout and netting of transactions with the same counter party upon the occurrence of certain events 
in addition  the corporation reduces risk by obtaining collateral based on individual assessments of the counter parties to these agreements 
the determination of the need for and levels of collateral will vary depending on the credit risk rating of the counter party 
see asset liability management and interest rate risk for further details regarding interest rate swap agreements 
as previously discussed  the corporation repositioned its balance sheet in the fourth quarter of as a result  the corporation extinguished million in debt and related interest rate swaps in october of as of december  and  the corporation had no stand alone derivative instruments outstanding 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are comprised of nonaccrual loans and other real estate owned oreo 
the nonaccrual status is determined after a loan is days past due or when deemed not collectible in full as to principal or interest  unless in management s opinion collection of both principal and interest is assured by way of collateralization  guarantees  or other security and the loan is in the process of collection 
oreo represents real estate acquired through foreclosure or deed in lieu thereof and is generally carried at the lower of cost or fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
management s policy for any accruing loan greater than days past due is to perform an analysis of the loan  including a consideration of the financial position of the borrower and any guarantor  as well as the value of the collateral  and use this information to make an assessment as to whether collectibility of the principal and interest appears probable 
if such collectibility is not probable  the loans are placed on nonaccrual status 
loans are returned to accrual status when management determines  based on an evaluation of the underlying collateral together with the borrower s payment record and financial condition  
table of contents that the borrower has the ability and intent to meet the contractual obligations of the loan agreement 
as of december   no loans were days or more past due and still accruing interest

a million increase in nonaccruals for mortgage loans was mostly offset by a million decrease in nonaccruals on consumer loans 
oreo increased million from year end as the number of properties under management increased by percent 
the gbc acquisition contributed  to the increase in oreo 
nonperforming assets as a percentage of total loans and other real estate owned decreased to percent at december   compared to percent at december  interest income that would have been recorded on nonaccrual loans and restructured loans for   and  had they performed in accordance with their original terms  amounted to   and million  respectively 
interest income on all such loans included in the results of operations for   and was   and  respectively 
nonaccrual loans at december   were not concentrated in any one industry and primarily consisted of loans secured by real estate 
nonaccrual loans as a percentage of loans may increase as economic conditions change 
management has taken current economic conditions into consideration when estimating the allowance for loan losses 
see allowance for loan losses for a more detailed discussion 
as of december   management identified a million commercial acquisition and development loan as a potential problem loan 
in early january  this loan became days past due and was placed on nonaccrual status 
at december   the bank anticipated the borrower would cure the delinquency to keep the loan from reaching days past due 
although this loan went on nonaccrual after year end  management believes the loan is well secured by the underlying collateral and continues to work with the borrower and guarantors to ensure full collection of principal 
allowance for loan losses the corporation s allowance for loan losses consists of three components i valuation allowances computed on impaired loans in accordance with sfas  ii valuation allowances determined by applying historical loss rates and reserve factors to those loans not specifically identified as impaired  and iii valuation allowances for factors which management believes are not reflected in the historical loss rates or that otherwise need to be considered when estimating the allowance for loan losses 
these three 
table of contents components are estimated quarterly and  along with a narrative analysis  comprise the corporation s allowance for loan losses model 
the resulting components are used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
all estimates of loan portfolio risk  including the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  are subject to general and local economic conditions  among other factors  which are unpredictable and beyond the corporation s control 
because a significant portion of the loan portfolio is comprised of real estate loans and loans to area businesses  the corporation is subject to risk in the real estate market and changes in the economic conditions in its primary market areas 
changes in these areas can increase or decrease the provision for loan losses 
as noted above  the corporation uses historical loss rates as a component of estimating future losses in the loan portfolio 
the corporation monitors the factors generated by the historical loss migration model and may from time to time adjust the rates included in the allowance for loan loss model 
since the corporation has experienced favorable credit quality trends for an extended period of time  those trends have been reducing the calculated historical loss rates for certain predefined loan categories 
based on results from the historical loss migration and management s assessment of the risk inherent in the portfolio  during the second quarter of  the corporation reduced its historical loss rate factor included in the allowance for loan loss model on certain commercial loan categories with similar risks resulting in a reduction of approximately million in required allowance 
during  the corporation made no changes to its estimated loss percentages for economic factors 
as a part of its quarterly assessment of the allowance for loan losses  the corporation reviews key local  regional and national economic information and assesses its impact on the allowance for loan losses 
based on its review for  the corporation noted that economic conditions are mixed  however  management concluded that the impact on borrowers and local industries in the corporation s primary market areas did not change significantly during the period 
accordingly  the corporation did not modify its loss estimate percentage attributable to economic factors in its allowance for loan losses model 
the corporation continually reviews its portfolio for any concentrations of loans to any one borrower or industry 
to analyze its concentrations  the corporation prepares various reports showing total risk concentrations to borrowers by industry  as well as reports showing total risk concentrations to one borrower 
at the present time  the corporation does not believe it is overly concentrated in any industry or specific borrower and therefore has made no allocations of allowances for loan losses for this factor for any of the periods presented 
the corporation also monitors the amount of operational risk that exists in the portfolio 
this would include the front end underwriting  documentation  and closing processes associated with the lending decision 
the percent of additional allocation for the operational reserve has not changed in recent periods 
the corporation continually assesses its loan loss allocation methodology and model 
during the course of  there were no material changes to the variables used in the allowance for loan loss model 
the corporation continues to use a loss history of months for consumer loans and months for commercial loans 
the corporation believes the loss histories accurately reflect the life cycle of the respective loan portfolios 
the corporation expects to continue the evolution of its allowance for loan loss methodology and model in the future

losses on unsecured consumer debt are recognized at days past due  compared to the regulatory loss criteria of days 
secured consumer loans  including residential real estate  are typically charged off between and days  depending on the collateral type  in compliance with the federal financial institutions examination council ffiec guidelines 
losses on commercial loans are recognized promptly upon determination that all or a portion of any loan balance is uncollectible 
any deficiency that exists after liquidation of collateral will be taken as a charge off 
subsequent payment received will be treated as a recovery when collected 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or percent of portfolio loans  at december   compared to million  or percent of portfolio loans  at december  the corporation s addition of gbc s loan portfolio as well as first charter s credit migration trends led to the higher allowance for loan loss ratio 

table of contents the following table presents the dollar amount of the allowance for loan losses applicable to major loan categories and the percentage of the loans in each category to total loans 
the amount of the allowance assigned to each loan category reflects both the absolute level of outstandings and the historical loss experience of the loans adjusted for current economic events or conditions

the total commercial loan allocation of allowance for loan losses increased million during  of which million was primarily attributable to the growth in commercial loans and secondarily to credit migration within the commercial portfolio 
gbc contributed the remaining million of the increase 
the allocation of allowance for loan losses for mortgage  home equity  and consumer loans decreased million primarily due to a decrease in loans outstanding 
in addition  a specific reserve for a residential investment property portfolio decreased million in association with a percent decrease in residential investment property loans outstanding 
at december   the allocation associated with the inherent risk in modeling the allowance for loan losses was million  essentially unchanged from million at december  management considers the allowance for loan losses adequate to cover inherent losses in the corporation s loan portfolio as of the date of the financial statements 
management believes it has established the allowance in consideration of the current and expected future economic environment 
while management uses the best information available to make evaluations  future adjustments to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic and other conditions 
additionally  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the corporation s allowances for loan losses 
such agencies may require the recognition of adjustments to the allowance based on their judgment of information available to them at the time of their examinations 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is the amount charged to earnings  which is necessary to maintain an adequate and appropriate allowance for loan losses 
accordingly  the factors  which influence changes in the allowance for loan losses  have a direct effect on the provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses changes from period to period as a result of a number of factors  the most significant for the corporation include the following i changes in the amounts of loans outstanding  which are used to estimate current probable loan losses  ii current charge offs and recoveries of loans  iii changes in impaired loan valuation allowances  iv changes in credit grades within the portfolio  which arise from a deterioration or an improvement in the performance of the borrower  v changes in loss percentages  and vi changes in the mix of types of loans 
in addition  the corporation considers other  more subjective factors  which impact the credit quality of the portfolio as a whole and estimates allocations of allowance for loan losses for these factors  as well 
these factors include loan concentrations  economic conditions and operational risks 
changes in these components of the allowance can arise from fluctuations in the underlying percentages used as related loss estimates for these factors  as well as variations in the portfolio balances to which they are applied 
the net change in all these components of the allowance for

net charge offs for totaled million  or percent of average portfolio loans  compared to million  or percent of average portfolio loans for even though the provision for loan loss decreased from the prior year  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of portfolio loans increased  from percent to percent 
in addition  of the million reduction in net charge offs  over million was related to a reduction in gross charge offs and less than of the improvement was related to recoveries 
market risk management asset liability management and interest rate risk interest rate risk is the exposure of earnings and capital to changes in interest rates 
the objective of asset liability management alm is to quantify and manage the change in interest rate risk associated with the corporation s balance sheet 
the management of the alm program includes oversight from the board of director s asset and liability committee board alco and the management asset and liability committee management alco 
two primary metrics used in analyzing interest rate risk are earnings at risk ear and economic value of equity eve 
the board of directors has established limits on the ear and eve risk measures 
management alco  comprised of select members of senior management  is charged with measuring performance relative to those limits and reporting the bank s performance to board alco 
interest rate risk is measured and monitored through simulation modeling 
the process is validated regularly by an independent third party 
both the ear and the eve risk measures were within policy guidelines as of december  management considers ear to be the best measure of short term interest rate risk 
this measure reflects the amount of net interest income that will be impacted by a change in interest rates over a month time frame 
a simulation model is used to run immediate and parallel changes in interest rates rate shocks from a base scenario using implied forward rates 
at a minimum  rate shock scenarios are run at plus and minus   and basis points 
from time to time  additional simulations are run to assess risk from changes in the slope of the yield curve 
the simulation model projects the net interest income over the next months for each scenario using consistent balance sheet growth projections and calculates the percentage change from the base scenario 
board alco has approved a policy limit for the change in ear over a month period of minus percent to a plus or minus basis point shock to interest rates 
at december   the estimated ear to a basis point increase in rates was plus percent while the estimated ear to a basis point decrease in rates was minus percent 
this compares with plus percent and minus percent  respectively  at december  the addition of gbc  with a more asset sensitive balance sheet  contributed to the improvement in ear in a rising rate scenario and the increased risk in ear in the declining rate scenario 
the asset sensitive nature of the gbc balance sheet would benefit from an increase in rates but would be adversely affected if rates were to decline 
management considers eve to be the best measure of long term interest rate risk 
this measure reflects the amount of net equity that will be impacted by changes in interest rates 
through simulation modeling  the corporation estimates the economic value of assets and the economic value of liabilities 
the difference between these two measures is the eve 
the eve is calculated for a series of scenarios in which current rates are shocked up and down by   and basis points and compared to a base scenario using the current yield curve 
board alco has approved a policy limit for the percentage change in eve of minus percent to a plus or minus basis point shock to interest rates 
at december   the estimated eve to a basis point increase in rates was minus percent  while the estimated eve to a basis point decrease in rates was plus percent 
at december   eve risk was minus percent and plus percent  respectively 
a change in the earning asset mix  primarily a 
table of contents reduction in investment securities and mortgage loans as a percentage of earning assets  contributed to the reduction in eve risk in the plus basis point scenario 
the result of any simulation is inherently uncertain and will not precisely estimate the impact of changes in rates on net interest income or the economic value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from simulated results due to  but not limited to  the timing and magnitude of the change in interest rates  changes in management strategies  and changes in market conditions 
during  the corporation entered into a series of interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million 
as a result of the balance sheet repositioning in  the corporation terminated these interest rate swap agreements 
the corporation executed the balance sheet repositioning by also extinguishing million of debt  some of which were hedged by the aforementioned swaps  and a similar amount of long term  low yield investment securities 
the combination of these transactions was designed to move the corporation toward its targeted interest rate risk and liquidity risk profile 
table sixteen summarizes the expected maturities and weighted average effective yields and rates associated with certain of the corporation s significant non trading financial instruments 
cash and cash equivalents  federal funds sold  and interest bearing bank deposits are excluded from table sixteen as their respective carrying values approximate fair values 
these financial instruments generally expose the corporation to insignificant market risk as they have either no stated maturities or an average maturity of less than days and interest rates that approximate market rates 
however  these financial instruments could expose the corporation to interest rate risk by requiring more or less reliance on alternative funding sources  such as long term debt 
the mortgage backed securities are shown at their weighted average expected life  obtained from an independent evaluation of the average remaining life of each security based on expected prepayment speeds of the underlying mortgages at december  these expected maturities  weighted average effective yields  and fair values will change if interest rates change 
demand deposits  money market accounts  and certain savings deposits are presented in the earliest maturity window because they have no stated maturity

these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
these instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amount recognized in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer so long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and may require collateral from the borrower if deemed necessary by the corporation 
included in loan commitments are commitments of million to cover customer deposit account overdrafts should they occur 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the corporation to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party up to a stipulated amount and with specified terms and conditions 
standby letters of credit are recorded as a liability by the corporation at the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
commitments to extend credit are not recorded as an asset or liability by the corporation until the instrument is exercised

table of contents commitments to extend credit  including loan commitments  standby letters of credit  and commercial letters of credit do not necessarily represent future cash requirements  in that these commitments often expire without being drawn upon 
liquidity risk liquidity is the ability to maintain cash flows adequate to fund operations and meet obligations and other commitments on a timely and cost effective basis 
liquidity is provided by the ability to attract retail deposits  by current earnings  and by a strong capital base that enables the corporation to use alternative funding sources that complement normal sources 
the corporation s asset liability management objectives include optimizing net interest income while continuing to provide adequate liquidity to meet continuing loan demand and deposit withdrawal requirements and to service normal operating expenses 
liquidity is managed at two levels 
the first is the liquidity of the corporation 
the second is the liquidity of the bank 
the management of liquidity at both levels is essential  because the corporation and the bank have different funding needs and sources  and each are subject to certain regulatory guidelines and requirements 
the primary source of funding for the corporation includes dividends received from the bank and proceeds from the issuance of common stock 
in addition  the corporation had commercial paper outstandings of million at december  primary uses of funds for the corporation include repayment of commercial paper  share repurchases  and dividends paid to shareholders 
during  the corporation issued trust preferred securities through specially formed trusts 
these securities are presented as long term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet and are includable in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes  subject to certain limitations 
primary sources of funding for the bank include customer deposits  wholesale deposits  other borrowings  loan repayments  and available for sale securities 
the bank has access to federal funds lines from various banks and borrowings from the federal reserve discount window 
in addition to these sources  the bank is a member of the fhlb  which provides access to fhlb lending sources 
at december   the bank had an available line of credit with the fhlb totaling billion with million outstanding 
at december   the bank and gwinnett bank also collectively had million of federal funds lines with million outstanding 
primary uses of funds include repayment of maturing obligations and growing the loan portfolio 
management believes the corporation s and the bank s sources of liquidity are adequate to meet loan demand  operating needs  and deposit withdrawal requirements 
the corporation has existing contractual obligations that will require payments in future periods 
the following table presents aggregated information about such payments to be made in future periods

capital management the corporation views capital as its most valuable and most expensive funding source 
the objective of effective capital management is to generate above market returns on equity to the corporation s shareholders while maintaining adequate regulatory capital ratios

shareholders equity at december   increased to million  representing percent of period end assets  compared to million  or percent  of period end assets at december  the million increase was primarily due to net income of million  million of stock issued in connection with business combinations  and million of stock issued under stock based compensation plans and the corporation s dividend reinvestment plan during these increases were partially offset by cash dividends of per common share  which resulted in cash dividend declarations of million for in addition  the accumulated other comprehensive loss after tax unrealized losses on available for sale securities decreased million to million at december   compared to million at december  
table of contents on january   the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million shares of the corporation s common stock 
as of december   the corporation had repurchased a total of million shares of its common stock at an average per share price of under this authorization  which has reduced shareholders equity by million 
no shares were repurchased under this authorization during on october   the corporation s board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million additional shares of the corporation s common stock 
as of december   no shares had been repurchased under this authorization 
the corporation anticipates repurchasing shares under one or both of these plans in under appropriate market conditions 
during  the corporation issued trust preferred securities through specially formed trusts in an aggregate amount of million 
these securities are presented as long term borrowings in the consolidated balance sheet and are includable in tier capital for regulatory capital purposes  subject to certain limitations 
the corporation s and the bank s various regulators have issued regulatory capital guidelines for us banking organizations 
failure to meet the capital requirements can initiate certain mandatory and discretionary actions by regulators that could have a material effect on the corporation s financial position and operations 
at december   the corporation and its banking subsidiaries were classified as well capitalized under these regulatory frameworks 
the principal asset of the corporation is its investment in the bank 
thus  the corporation derives its principal source of income through dividends from the bank 
certain regulatory and other requirements restrict the lending of funds by the subsidiary banks to the corporation and the amount of dividends which can be paid to the corporation 
in addition  certain regulatory agencies may prohibit the payment of dividends by the bank if they determine that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice 
see business governmental supervision and regulation  business capital and operational requirements and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these restrictions 
the corporation and the bank must comply with regulatory capital requirements established by the applicable federal regulatory agencies 
under the standards of the federal reserve board  the corporation and the bank must maintain a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined to total risk weighted assets of percent and a minimum ratio of total capital as defined to risk weighted assets of percent 
tier capital includes common shareholders equity  trust preferred securities  minority interests and qualifying preferred stock  less goodwill and other adjustments 
total capital is comprised of tier i capital plus certain adjustments  the largest of which for the corporation is the allowance for loan losses up to percent of risk weighted assets 
total capital must consist of at least percent of tier capital 
risk weighted assets refer to the on and off balance sheet exposures of the corporation adjusted for their related risk levels using amounts set forth in federal reserve standards 
in addition to the aforementioned risk based capital requirements  the corporation is subject to a leverage capital requirement  requiring a minimum ratio of tier i capital as defined previously to total adjusted average assets of percent to percent 
the bank also has similar regulatory capital requirements imposed by the federal reserve board 
see business governmental supervision and regulation  business capital and operational requirements and note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these requirements 
at december   the corporation and the bank were in compliance with all existing capital requirements and were classified as well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines 
in the judgment of management  there have been no events or conditions since december   that would change the well capitalized status of the corporation or the bank 
it is management s intention for both the 
table of contents corporation and the bank to continue to be well capitalized for the foreseeable future 
the capital requirements of the corporation  the bank  and gwinnett bank are summarized in the table below as of december  table twenty one capital ratios for capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized actual minimum minimum dollars in thousands amount ratio amount ratio amount ratio leverage first charter corporation   none none first charter bank gwinnett banking company tier i capital first charter corporation   none none first charter bank gwinnett banking company total risk based capital first charter corporation   none none first charter bank gwinnett banking company tier capital consists of total equity plus qualifying capital securities and minority interests  less unrealized gains and losses accumulated in other comprehensive income  certain intangible assets  and adjustments related to the valuation of servicing assets and certain equity investments in nonfinancial companies principal investments 
the leverage ratio reflects tier capital divided by average total assets for the period 
average assets used in the calculation exclude certain intangible and servicing assets 
total risk based capital is comprised of tier capital plus qualifying subordinated debt and allowance for loan losses and a portion of unrealized gains on certain equity securities 
both the tier and the total risk based capital ratios are computed by dividing the respective capital amounts by risk weighted assets  as defined

overview net income amounted to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   a decrease from net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  in the fourth quarter of  the corporation incurred an approximate million after tax charge resulting from a series of balance sheet initiatives  which included the sale of securities and the extinguishment of debt and termination of interest rate swaps 
the return on average assets and return on average equity was percent and percent in  respectively  compared to percent and percent in  respectively 
net interest income for  net interest income totaled million  an increase of percent from net interest income of million for this increase was primarily due to a million increase in average loan balances  an increase in the proportion of noninterest bearing deposits to the composition of funding 
table of contents sources and to a lesser extent the balance sheet repositioning which occurred in late october this was partially offset by higher rates paid on interest bearing liabilities relative to increases in asset yields 
the net interest margin decreased basis points to percent in  compared to percent in the net interest margin was negatively impacted by a basis point increase in the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
partially offsetting this increase was a basis point increase in earning asset yields compared to since the balance sheet repositioning occurred in late october  the benefit to the net interest margin for the year was minimal 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses for was million  compared to million for the increase in the provision for loan losses was primarily attributable to the inherent risk associated with increased lending 
the provision for loan losses was also impacted by a million increase in net charge offs  compared to net charge offs for were million  or percent of average portfolio loans  compared to million  or percent of average portfolio loans  for the increase in charge offs was primarily due to a decrease in recoveries 
noninterest income noninterest income from continuing operations decreased million in  or percent  to million  compared to million in deposit service charges increased million in part due to checking account growth and increases in transaction volume

regulatory recommendations management is not presently aware of any current recommendations to the corporation or to the bank by regulatory authorities which  if they were to be implemented  would have a material effect on the corporation s liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments notes and to the consolidated financial statements discuss new accounting pronouncements adopted by the corporation during the expected impact of accounting pronouncements recently issued but not yet adopted is discussed below 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting pronouncements materially affects financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  the effects are discussed in the applicable section of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes to the consolidated financial statements 
fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement this standard permits an entity to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this option is available to all entities 
most of the provisions in sfas are elective  however  the amendment to sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities with available for sale and trading securities 
the fasb s stated objective in issuing this standard is as follows to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the fair value option established by sfas permits all entities to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
a business entity will report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings or another performance indicator if the business entity does not report earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
the fair value option a may be applied instrument by instrument  with a few exceptions  such as investments otherwise accounted for by the equity method  b is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and c is applied only to entire instruments and not to portions of instruments 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of the previous fiscal year provided that the entity makes that choice in the first days of that fiscal year and also elects to apply the provisions of sfas  fair 
table of contents value measurements 
the corporation has yet to determine what impact  if any  the adoption of sfas will have on its financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which replaces the different definitions of fair value in existing accounting literature with a single definition  sets out a framework for measuring fair value  and requires additional disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement clarifies that fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or the price paid to transfer a liability in the most advantageous market available to the entity and emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement and should be based on the assumptions market participants would use 
the statement also creates a three level hierarchy under which individual fair value estimates are to be ranked based on the relative reliability of the inputs used in the valuation 
this hierarchy is the basis for the disclosure requirements  with fair value estimates based on the least reliable inputs requiring more extensive disclosures about the valuation method used and the gains and losses associated with those estimates 
sfas is required to be applied whenever another financial accounting standard requires or permits an asset or liability to be measured at fair value 
the statement does not expand the use of fair value to any new circumstances 
the corporation will be required to apply the new guidance beginning january   and does not expect it to have a material impact on financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june  the fasb issued interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas  accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a comprehensive model for how companies should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in their financial statements uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
under fin  tax positions shall initially be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination by the tax authorities 
such tax positions shall initially and subsequently be measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority assuming full knowledge of the position and all relevant facts 
fin also revises disclosure requirements to include an annual tabular rollforward of unrecognized tax benefits 
the provisions of this interpretation are required to be adopted for fiscal periods beginning after december  the corporation will be required to apply the provisions of fin to all tax positions upon initial adoption with any cumulative effect adjustment to be recognized as an adjustment to retained earnings 
the corporation is currently evaluating the provisions of fin and anticipates its adoption will not have a material impact on its financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
accounting for servicing of financial assets in march  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for servicing of financial assets  an amendment of sfas this standard requires entities to separately recognize a servicing asset or liability whenever it undertakes an obligation to service financial assets and also requires all separately recognized servicing assets or liabilities to be initially measured at fair value 
additionally  this standard permits entities to choose among two alternatives  the amortization method or fair value measurement method  for the subsequent measurement of each class of separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities 
under the amortization method  an entity shall amortize the value of servicing assets or liabilities in proportion to and over the period of estimated net servicing income or net servicing loss and assess servicing assets or liabilities for impairment or increased obligation based on fair value at each reporting date 
under the fair value measurement method  an entity shall measure servicing assets or liabilities at fair value at each reporting date and report changes in fair value in earnings in the period in which the changes occur 
the corporation will adopt this standard effective january  the corporation expects it will elect amortization as the measurement method for residential real estate mortgage servicing rights and small business administration loan servicing rights 
as such  the initial adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material impact on financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments in february  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which amends sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial 
table of contents assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
sfas requires entities to evaluate and identify whether interests in securitized financial assets are freestanding derivatives  hybrid financial instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation  or hybrid financial instruments that contain embedded derivatives that do not require bifurcation 
sfas also permits fair value measurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation 
this statement will be effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued by the corporation on or after january  at adoption  any difference between the total carrying amount of the individual components of the existing bifurcated hybrid financial instrument and the fair value of the combined hybrid financial instrument shall be recognized as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the corporation s financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity 
effects of prior year misstatements in september  the securities and exchange commission issued staff accounting bulletin sab  considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements 
sab is an amendment to part of title of the code of federal regulations 
sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
the bulletin recommends registrants quantify the effect of correcting all misstatements  including both the carryover and the reversing effects of prior year misstatements  on the current year financial statements 
in december  the corporation adopted the provisions of sab using the rollover approach resulted in an accumulation of misstatements to the corporation s balance sheets that were deemed immaterial to the corporation s financial statements because the amounts that originated in each year were quantitatively and qualitatively immaterial 
evaluating these errors using the iron curtain approach resulted in material errors 
consequently  the corporation has elected  as allowed under sab  to reflect the effect of initially applying this guidance by adjusting the carrying amount of the impacted accounts as of the beginning of and recording an offsetting adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in accordingly  the corporation recorded a cumulative adjustment to decrease retained earnings by million upon the adoption of sab refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
from time to time  the fasb issues exposure drafts for proposed statements of financial accounting standards 
such exposure drafts are subject to comment from the public  to revisions by the fasb and to final issuance by the fasb as statements of financial accounting standards 
management considers the effect of the proposed statements on the consolidated financial statements of the corporation and monitors the status of changes to and proposed effective dates of exposure drafts
