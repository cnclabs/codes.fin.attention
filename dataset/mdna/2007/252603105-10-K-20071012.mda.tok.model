item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations summary we are a branded food company specializing in processing  marketing and distributing culinary  in shell and ingredient nuts and snack products 
our company was founded in and has a strong heritage in the inshell and culinary markets under the diamond of california brand 
on july  we converted from an agricultural cooperative association to a delaware corporation and completed the initial public offering of our common stock 
as a public company  our focus is on building stockholder value 
we intend to expand our existing business and to continue to introduce higher value branded products in our culinary and snack businesses  including snack products marketed under our emerald and emerald harmony brand names 
our products are sold in over  retail locations in the united states and in over countries 
we sell products to approximately customers  including over international customers 
in general  we sell directly to retailers  particularly large  national grocery store and drug store chains  and indirectly through wholesale distributors who serve independent and small regional retail grocery store chains and convenience stores 
we also sell our products to mass merchandisers  club stores  convenience stores and through other retail channels 
our business is seasonal 
consumer demand for nut products  particularly in shell nuts and to a lesser extent  culinary nuts  is highest during the months of october  november and december 
we receive our principal raw material  walnuts  during the period from september to november and process it throughout the year 
as a result of this seasonality  our personnel and working capital requirements and walnut inventories peak during the last quarter of the calendar year 
this seasonality also impacts capacity utilization at our facilities  which routinely operate at capacity for the last four months of the calendar year 
diamond s focus is on expanding sales of products in the north american retail channel  particularly snack and culinary products 
for non retail channels  during the last two years  diamond has focused on increasing sales of higher value added  higher margin products while reducing sales of lower margin products 
as a result  volume sales have declined in this channel and are expected to decline for at least the next year 
accordingly  diamond periodically assesses its walnut supply requirements and sources  including the volume of walnuts to be received under long term contracts or from other sources 
the allocation of walnuts received from the various sources may vary from year to year 
table of contents depending on a variety of factors  including contract renewals  diamond s assessment of future walnut supply and demand and other factors 
a disproportionate amount of our net sales and related net income net proceeds prior to the fiscal year ended july  are recognized in the first half of our fiscal year 
for example  net sales in the first half of and were and of net sales for each full fiscal year 
in the near term  we expect a higher percentage of our net income to be earned in the first half of our fiscal year because many of our operating costs are fixed and cannot be reduced when net sales are lower quarter to quarter 
however  as we continue to introduce new products  such as snack products  we expect net sales  and related net income  to be less seasonal 
the historical financial information contained herein for fiscal years prior to have been derived from financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap for agricultural cooperative associations 
effective august   our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap for companies that are not cooperative associations 
the principal difference relates to accounting for walnut inventories 
as an agricultural cooperative association we used the net realizable value  or nrv  method to value walnut inventories delivered by members 
nrv is the estimated sales price of inventories less estimated completion  distribution and selling costs 
our financial statements prior to august  did not include a cost of goods sold for walnuts received from members 
effective august   we account for purchases of walnuts from growers on a lower of cost or market basis 
consequently  the results of operations reported subsequent to fiscal year are significantly different than net proceeds reported in fiscal year and prior 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
our critical accounting policies are set forth below 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when a persuasive arrangement exists  title has transferred based upon terms of shipment  price is fixed  delivery occurs and collection is reasonably assured 
revenues are recorded net of rebates  introductory or slotting payments  coupons  promotion and marketing allowances 
customers have the right to return certain products 
these product returns are estimated based upon historical results and are reflected as a reduction in net sales 
inventories 
all inventories are accounted for on a lower of cost first in  first out or market basis 
in connection with our july initial public offering  we entered into long term walnut purchase agreements with substantially all of our former member growers 
under these agreements  growers deliver their entire walnut crop to us during the fall harvest season and we provide to each grower their purchase price for this inventory by march of the following year 
this purchase price will be a price determined by diamond in good faith  taking into account market conditions  crop size  quality  and varieties  among other relevant factors 
since the ultimate price to be paid will be determined each march subsequent to receiving the walnut crop  management must make an estimate of this price for the first and second quarter interim financial statements 
these estimates are subject to change and such changes  if any  could be material 
we determined the purchase prices for the and crops in march and  respectively 
these determinations had no material impact on previously reported quarterly results 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we periodically review long lived assets and certain identifiable intangible assets for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each year 
we cannot assure you that a material impairment charge will not be recorded in the future 
for assets to be held and used  including acquired intangibles  we initiate our review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of intangible assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of an asset is measured by comparison of its carrying amount to the expected future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is 
table of contents expected to generate 
any impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
significant management judgment is required in this process 
employee benefits 
we incur various employment related benefit costs with respect to qualified and nonqualified pension and deferred compensation plans 
assumptions are made related to discount rates used to value certain liabilities  assumed rates of return on assets in the plans  compensation increases  employee turnover and mortality rates 
we utilize curcio webb llc  a third party actuarial firm to assist us in determining appropriate assumptions and plan valuations 
different assumptions could result in the recognition of differing amounts of expense over different periods of time 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized for the tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax basis of recorded assets and liabilities at current tax rates 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the recoverability of deferred tax assets is based on both our historical and anticipated earnings levels and is reviewed periodically to determine if an adjustment to the valuation allowance is necessary to state such assets at amounts that will more likely than not be recovered 
accounting for stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation arrangements  including stock option grants and restricted stock awards  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r share based payment 
under sfas no 
r  compensation cost is recognized based on the fair value of equity awards on the date of grant 
the compensation cost is then amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options at the date of grant 
this model requires us to make assumptions such as expected term  volatility and forfeiture rates that determine the stock options fair value 
these key assumptions are based on historical information and judgment regarding market factors and trends 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  we may be required to increase or decrease compensation expense or income tax expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
non gaap financial information the following non gaap financial information excludes a one time charge to cost of sales in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of the conversion from a cooperative association to a public company in july this charge relates to the use of nrv accounting for certain inventories acquired prior to august  starting august   we began using the lower of cost or market method of valuing walnut inventories acquired subsequent to that date 
as a result of using nrv accounting for certain inventories through july   these inventories were valued higher than they would have been under the lower of cost or market method 
therefore  as those inventories were sold  the amount charged to cost of goods sold was higher 
beginning august   our cost basis for walnuts is the price we pay for them 
for the year ended july   estimated walnut acquisition cost is presented for purposes of comparability of our financial results to the years ended july  and estimated walnut acquisition costs are based on the field price reported by the california statistical office of the usda national agricultural statistics service  or cass  for each related crop year 
we believe this information is the only available measure of industry wide walnut acquisition costs 
we cannot determine an actual cost basis for walnuts acquired and sold in years prior to fiscal year in addition  we are unable to determine retroactively what we would have paid for walnuts in prior years had we not been a cooperative association  are unable to determine whether what we would have paid for walnuts would approximate amounts paid to other growers by other processors as reflected in the cass statistics  are limited by the level of detail provided by the cass statistics  and cannot ensure that the cost of sales amounts implied by the cass statistics are representative of future cost of sales amounts 
we have not undertaken any effort to validate the accuracy of the cass statistics

off balance sheet arrangements as of july   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
effects of inflation the most significant inflationary factor affecting our net sales and cost of sales is the change in market prices for purchased nuts 
the prices of these commodities are affected by world market conditions and are volatile in response to supply and demand  as well as political and economic events 
the price fluctuations of these commodities do not necessarily correlate with the general inflation rate 
inflation may  however  adversely affect operating costs such as labor  energy and materials 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  which clarifies the accounting for income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
our principal market risks are exposure to changes in commodity prices and interest rates on borrowings 
although we have international sales and related trade receivables from foreign customers  there is no significant foreign currency exchange risk as substantially all sales are denominated in us dollars 
commodities risk 
the availability  size  quality and cost of raw materials for the production of our products  including walnuts  pecans  peanuts  cashews  almonds and other nuts  are subject to risks inherent to farming  such as crop size and yield fluctuations caused by poor weather and growing conditions  pest and disease problems  and other factors beyond our control 
additionally  our supply of raw materials could be reduced if governmental agencies conclude that our products have been tampered with  or that certain pesticides  herbicides or other chemicals used by growers have left harmful residues on portions of the crop or that the crop has been contaminated by aflatoxin or other agents 
interest rate risk 
we have established a formal investment policy to help minimize the market risk exposure of our cash and cash equivalents  which are primarily affected by credit quality and movements in interest rates 
these guidelines focus on managing liquidity and preserving principal 
our cash equivalents are primarily held for liquidity purposes and are comprised of high quality investments with maturities of less than days when purchased 
with such a short maturity  our portfolio s market value is relatively insensitive to interest rate changes 
the sensitivity of our cash and cash equivalent portfolio as of july  to a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would be an increase of pretax income of approximately million or a decrease of pretax income of million  respectively 
interest rate volatility could also materially affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt  as well as the interest rate we pay on future borrowings against our lines of credit and revolver 
the interest rate we pay on future borrowings under our lines of credit and revolver are dependent on the london interbank offered rate libor
