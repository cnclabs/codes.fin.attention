demand in the rv and certain portions of the housing segments generally declines during the winter season  while sales and profits are generally highest during the spring and summer months 
inflation and changing prices have had minimal direct impact on the company in the past in that selling prices and material costs have generally followed the rate of inflation 
however  in  rapid escalation of prices for certain raw materials combined with a number of price protected sales contracts adversely affected profits in the housing segment 
the rv segment was also affected adversely by raw material inflation  but to a lesser degree due to material surcharges added to the prices of products sold to dealers

another opportunity for the housing group involves the reconstruction of the gulf coast regions damaged by the hurricanes in as the infrastructure  including basic utilities  vital services and transportation networks are restored  the company expects to receive contracts for its modular homes and multi family structures which offer better costs  structural integrity and timeliness of completion than other alternatives

housing segment the housing group faced a challenging housing market in  which had a significant impact on the group s results 
the december figures on housing starts from the us census bureau show a year over year decline in new single family homes nationwide  and a decline in the midwest region served by the group s plants in iowa  indiana and ohio 
the softening of the home markets has now spread to the southeastern and middle atlantic markets  which previously were doing relatively well 
single family housing starts in the south region showed a year over year decline of in december 
in the backdrop of such a difficult market  the housing group has seen the weakness in its core midwestern markets spread into the southeast and middle atlantic regions  negatively impacting the group s operations in north carolina and virginia 
all of group s markets have experienced sharp discounts and incentives  and increased levels of new home inventories 
as the downward pressure on new home sales persists  the group will likely see the more aggressive discounts and incentives by home builders continue 
to mitigate these conditions  management is placing more emphasis on providing value to builders and consumers through the group s products 
to this end  the group introduced two new entry level home collections in and will be introducing two new collections of homes to its builders at the upcoming builder meeting in march management s overriding goal with these actions is to provide the group s builders with the products and tools they need to best meet the challenges of their local markets 
the company also replaced virtually the entire management team at the all american operation in colorado during in response to operating difficulties and inefficiencies 
management continued to work to mitigate the group s dependence on traditional scattered lot single family housing markets by expanding into multi family residential structures through all american building systems  or aabs 
in  aabs was a leading member of a consortium that was awarded a project for the second phase of barracks construction at fort bliss in texas 
management anticipates more similar projects to be released for bid over the first half of management also is pursuing opportunities in the gulf coast region  and has orders to provide systems built homes for a neighborhood near new orleans 
in addition  the group is shifting its strategy to target large projects such as dormitories  condominiums and apartment complexes 
the group s virginia operation has already shifted in that direction in response to a softening in its local single family housing market 
overall  was a difficult year for the housing group  but management took aggressive steps to reduce operating costs and maintain profitability despite lower revenues 
at the end of  the group installed a new senior management team with the talent  experience and drive to lead it forward 
management is aggressively seeking new ways to strengthen the group s traditional markets while pursuing growth in new areas 
recreational vehicle segment despite the improvements recognized in the rv group s operations throughout  low sales volumes and production levels resulted in unacceptable bottom line results for the year 
to address the unacceptable level of revenues  the rv group has embarked on a number of actions to drive revenue growth and enhance profitability 
as clearly evident in the company s research  industry research and other published findings  the customers identify quality throughout our industry as an opportunity 
management believes that it can create a differentiating and marketable advantage by elevating the level of product quality 
to accomplish this  the group has launched a number of initiatives 
the most important of these initiatives is the involvement of the entire team  inclusive of our production workforce 
management implemented a pilot quality incentive program for the production workforce in september the goals of this program were to motivate all team members to take full ownership of the quality of products produced in each plant  as well as  to provide concrete  quantifiable measures of quality that could be applied to all plants 
the results of this pilot program were very successful  not only in the reduction in the number of defects per unit  but also in the response of dealers 
this program has since been expanded into a company wide quality program that rewards meaningful continuous improvement in the quality of our products at each and every production facility and includes all disciplines of operations engineering  production and purchasing 
in addition  the rv group facility in georgia consolidated operations into a single plant and entirely changed its focus to the rapidly growing sport utility trailer sut segment of a market rather than the large variety of different models previously produced 
with regard to product line weakness  the rv group made significant strides in improving its product offerings and reducing product complexity 
at the national rv trade show held annually in louisville  the company s products displayed showed a substantial improvement in innovation resulting from the group s new product development process 
over of the products on display at louisville were new and innovative products and were developed within the days leading up to the show  including the all new aurora class a featuring a full wall slide out and the innovative blast multi purpose hauler  a light weight trailer that is suitable for work during the week and play on the weekends and vacations 
management believes there are still opportunities to reduce material costs  which is where the majority of the group s cost of sales lies 
in order to bolster strategic sourcing efforts  the rv group recently hired a vice president of finance and strategic sourcing 
management is also currently redefining the organizational structure and processes of its strategic sourcing group 
in order to quickly achieve significant results  management has engaged consultants to assist with identifying and executing strategic sourcing action plans 
the ultimate goal of these actions is to improve quality and reduce cost in order to improve margins 
management also intends to apply best practices from this effort to purchasing and material sourcing in the housing group 
despite the difficult year  management is optimistic that the hard work of its entire team will pay substantial future dividends 
management will strive to leverage the many changes and improvements that have been made throughout the rv group to generate improved results and market share gains in and the years ahead

note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies were selected because they are broadly applicable within our operating units and they involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods  assumptions and estimates necessary in determining the related income statement  asset and or liability amounts 
long lived assets long lived assets held and used by the company  including property  plant and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements for asset impairments recorded in  including impairments of intangible assets 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses 
goodwill assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to impairment tests at least annually in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company reviews the carrying amounts of goodwill assets annually by segment to determine if such assets may be impaired 
if the carrying amounts of these assets are not recoverable based upon a discounted cash flow analysis  such assets are reduced by the estimated shortfall of fair value to recorded value 
the company has performed the required annual impairment tests and has determined that there was no impairment indicated for recorded goodwill 
our estimates of fair value of the reporting units could change as a result of our actual cash flows differing from our forecasted cash flows  which were used in our estimate of fair value 
further  a variance in the discount rate used could have an impact on the amount of goodwill impairment recorded 
revenue recognition for the recreational vehicle segment  the shipping terms are free on board fob shipping point and title and risk of ownership are transferred to the independent dealers at that time 
accordingly  sales are recognized as revenue at the time the products are shipped 
for the housing segment  the shipping terms are generally fob destination 
title and risk of ownership are transferred when the company completes installation of the product 
the company generally recognizes the revenue at the time delivery and installation are completed 
revenue from final set up procedures  which are perfunctory  is deferred and recognized when such set up procedures are completed 
warranty reserves the company provides customers of its products with a warranty covering defects in material or workmanship for periods generally ranging from one to two years in length and up to ten years on certain structural components 
the company records a liability based on its estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
estimated costs related to product warranty are accrued at the time of sale and included in cost of sales 
general warranty reserves are estimated based upon past warranty claims and unit sales history and adjusted as required to reflect actual costs incurred  as information becomes available 
specific warranty reserves are based on specific identified issues with the amounts accrued based on the estimated cost to correct the problem 
while the company believes this method to be consistent and appropriate  changes in estimates could materially affect the company s recorded liability for loss 
warranty expense from continuing operations totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
accrued liabilities for warranty expense at december  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase in warranty expense from continuing operations for of million to million is primarily the result of costs associated with the recall of camping trailer lift systems and the repair of laminated sidewalls of certain of the company s recreational vehicles 
the sizable product warranty claims relating to sidewalls and camping trailer lift systems damaged our reputation among rv dealers and consumers  which impacted our operating and financial results in and may continue to do so in the future 
litigation and product liability reserves at december  the company had reserves for certain other loss exposures  such as product liability million and litigation million see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company s litigation reserve is determined based on an individual case evaluation process 
the company is self insured for a portion of its product liability and certain other liability exposures 
depending on the nature of the claim and the date of occurrence  the company s maximum exposure ranges from  to  per claim 
the company accrues an estimated liability based on various factors  including sales levels  insurance coverage and the amount of outstanding claims 
management believes the liability recorded see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements is adequate to cover the company s self insured risk 
the company s estimated loss reserves for product liability are determined using loss triangles established by the company s management reflecting historical claims incurred by the company 
while the company believes this method to be consistent and appropriate  changes in estimates based on historical trends could materially affect the company s recorded liabilities for loss 
income taxes the company recognizes income tax expense in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are established for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements or tax returns using enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse and are subject to ongoing assessment of realizability 
deferred income tax expense benefit represents the change in net deferred tax assets and liabilities during the year 
deferred tax assets may be recognized for temporary differences that will result in deductible amounts in future periods and for loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
primarily due to the company s losses from continuing operations over the last two years  a non cash charge of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of to establish a reserve for its deferred tax assets 
depending on future operating results it is possible the valuation allowance could be reversed which would increase deferred tax assets and the company s income tax benefit
