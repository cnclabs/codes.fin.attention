item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we sell cemetery property and funeral and cemetery products and services both at the time of need and on a preneed basis 
our revenues in each period are derived primarily from at need sales  preneed sales delivered out of our backlog during the period including the accumulated trust fund earnings or build up in the face value of insurance contracts related to these preneed deliveries  preneed cemetery property sales and other items such as perpetual care trust earnings and finance charges 
we also earn commissions on the sale of insurance funded preneed funeral contracts that will be funded by life insurance or annuity contracts issued by third party insurers when we act as an agent on the sale 
overview of fiscal year for fiscal year  we had net earnings of million compared to a million for fiscal year fiscal year earnings from continuing operations increased by million to million compared to million for fiscal year funeral revenue decreased million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year during fiscal year we recorded an increase of million in funeral revenue related to an out of period adjustment and million of business interruption insurance proceeds related to the hurricanes 
during  our same store funeral operations experienced an increase in the average revenue per traditional funeral service of percent and an increase in average revenue per cremation service of percent 
the increase in the average revenue per traditional funeral and cremation service were partially offset by a shift in mix to lower priced cremation services resulting in an overall increase in the same store average revenue per funeral service of percent 
we also experienced a decrease in same store funeral services performed of percent 
the cremation rate for our same store operations was percent for fiscal year compared to percent for fiscal year 
table of contents cemetery revenue increased million from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year due to increases in construction during the period on various cemetery projects and an increase in gross cemetery property sales 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in merchandise delivery revenue due in part to a decrease in interments and an increase in the reserve for cancellations  which was due in large part to an improvement in the reserve for cancellations in the prior year following hurricane katrina 
funeral gross profit decreased million due primarily to the decrease in revenue discussed above and a million increase in expenses 
the increase in expenses is primarily due to an increase in property  casualty and general liability insurance costs along with a million impairment charge related to funeral licenses in the state of maryland 
cemetery gross profit increased million 
there was a million increase in hurricane related charges in over we recorded a million charge for net hurricane related costs in compared to a million recovery in interest expense decreased million due to a basis point decrease in the average rate during the year 
the decrease in the average rate is primarily due to additional interest incurred in fiscal year on the company s percent senior notes as a result of the company s inability to timely complete a required exchange offer and due in part to the reduction in interest resulting from the issuance of million of senior convertible notes 
in june  we issued million of percent senior convertible notes and million of percent senior convertible notes  and we prepaid our term loan b 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded a charge for the loss of early extinguishment of debt of million 
we recognized tax expenses and benefits during fiscal year the largest of these was a million income tax benefit due to the utilization of a capital loss carry forward and the completion of an audit in the commonwealth of puerto rico  resulting in a lower effective tax rate of percent for fiscal year compared to percent for fiscal year cash flow from operations decreased from million for the year ended october  to million for the year ended october   due primarily to million in unusual trust withdrawals received during fiscal year associated with the deferred revenue project compared to million in in addition  we made net tax payments of million during compared to million in due to a net operating loss carryforward utilized in fiscal year there were also million of net cash inflows recorded related to hurricane katrina in compared to million of cash outflows in lastly  we received million due to the execution of a lease of our mineral rights at one of our cemeteries to an outside third party 
during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of our class a common stock in connection with the june senior convertible debt transaction for million and paid million  or per share  in dividends 
in addition  in september  the board approved a new million stock repurchase program  and in december increased the program by an additional million 
for fiscal year  we experienced a percent increase in cemetery property sales and a percent decrease in preneed funeral sales 
reconstruction of our largest funeral operation in new orleans began in early fiscal year and was completed in november our second largest funeral home in new orleans reopened in the second quarter of we discovered certain adjustments that relate to prior accounting periods while preparing our quarterly report for the three months ended july  and our annual report for the year ended october   which are reflected in this annual report 
see note v to the consolidated financial statements included in item we do not believe these adjustments were quantitatively or qualitatively material to our financial position  results of operations and cash flows for the year ended october  or to any of our prior annual or quarterly financial statements 
as a result  we did not restate any prior period amounts 

table of contents preneed backlog  trust portfolio and cash impact of sales overview we believe that preneed funeral and cemetery property sales are two of the primary drivers of sustainable long term growth in the number of families served by our funeral homes and cemeteries 
our preneed funeral service and merchandise sales and preneed cemetery service and merchandise sales are deferred into our backlog while our preneed cemetery property sales are recognized currently in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate sfas no 

for a detailed discussion of our revenue recognition policies and how we account for our at need sales  preneed sales and trust earnings  see notes i  j  k  and notes through to the consolidated financial statements included in item backlog we estimate that as of october  the future value of our preneed funeral and cemetery services and merchandise backlog represented approximately billion of revenue to be recognized in the future as these prepaid products and services are delivered 
this represents the face value of the backlog plus the earnings that are projected on the funds held in trust and the estimated build up in the face value of insurance contracts 
it assumes no future preneed sales and assumes maturities each year consistent with our experience  with the majority of existing contracts expected to mature over the next years 
as of october   the value of the preneed backlog  excluding any future earnings on the funds held in trust and any build up in the face value of insurance contracts  but including unrealized earnings and losses on the funds held in trust and realized earnings and losses on the funds held in trust not yet recognized as revenue  was approximately billion 
trust portfolio we maintain three types of trusts and escrow accounts preneed funeral merchandise and services  preneed cemetery merchandise and services and cemetery perpetual care 
because a portion of the funds we receive from preneed sales are deposited into the trusts and invested in a variety of debt and equity securities and other investments  the performance of the trusts investments can affect our current and future revenue streams 
we recognize earnings and losses realized by preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts at the time of delivery of underlying products and services 
we recognize all earnings and losses realized by our cemetery perpetual care trusts currently  including capital gains and losses in those jurisdictions where capital gains can be withdrawn and used for cemetery maintenance 
because approximately percent of our total trust portfolio is currently invested in a diversified group of equity securities  we would generally expect our portfolio performance to improve if the performance of the overall stock market improves  but we would also expect its performance to deteriorate over time if the overall stock market declines 
the following table presents the overall annual realized return in our domestic trusts 
these returns represent interest  dividends and realized capital gains or losses but not unrealized capital gains or losses 
unrealized gains or losses include temporary and other than temporary gains and losses 
for fiscal year  including realized and unrealized gains and losses  we achieved an percent return on our funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and a percent return on our perpetual care trusts  compared to percent and percent  respectively  for fiscal year for the last three fiscal years ended october   our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts experienced an average annual return of percent  and our perpetual care trusts experienced an average annual return of percent 
we mark our trust portfolio to market value each quarter 
changes in the market value of the trusts are recorded by increasing or decreasing trust assets included in the preneed funeral and cemetery receivables and trust investments line items on the balance sheet  with a corresponding increase or decrease in the deferred preneed revenue and non controlling interest line items on the balance sheet 
therefore  there is no effect on current period net income 

table of contents we determine whether or not the investment portfolio has an other than temporary impairment on a security by security basis 
a loss is considered other than temporary if the security has a reduction in market value compared with its cost basis of percent or more for a period of six months or longer 
in addition  we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any of the temporarily impaired assets should be designated as other than temporarily impaired due to changes in market conditions or concerns specific to the issuer of the securities 
if a loss is other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is adjusted downward to its market value  which is allocated to the non controlling interests in the trusts 
this affects our footnote disclosure but does not have an effect on our financial statements  since the trust portfolio is already marked to market value each quarter 
the footnotes disclose the adjusted cost basis and how much of the losses are considered other than temporary 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses reflected in the tables in notes  and to the consolidated financial statements included in item are temporary as the cost basis in these tables have already been adjusted to reflect the other than temporary unrealized losses 
our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and escrow accounts had other than temporary declines of million and million  respectively  as of october   from their original cost basis 
they had net unrealized appreciation of million and million  respectively  as of october  resulting from temporary unrealized gains and losses 
see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item our cemetery perpetual care trust accounts had other than temporary declines of million as of october   from their original cost basis 
they had net unrealized appreciation of million as of october  resulting from temporary unrealized gains and losses 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item unrealized gains and losses in the cemetery perpetual care trusts and escrow accounts do not affect current earnings but unrealized losses could limit the capital gains available to us and could eventually result in lower returns and lower revenues than we have historically achieved from these trusts 
aggregate unrealized losses for twelve months or longer for temporarily impaired investments totaled million at october   up from million at october  while the loss has increased  based on review of the individual securities and the criteria the company uses to determine impairment of percent or more for a period of six months or longer  we do not believe these securities are other than temporarily impaired 
of the million  approximately percent  or million  were generated by preferred stock investments and percent  or million  were generated by common stock investments 
the common stocks are represented by assets in companies of which are included in the standard and poor s index s p index 
the market value of these securities represents approximately percent of the market value of the securities in our trust portfolio 
the preferred stocks are primarily in the financial services sector which has experienced a decline in market value due to increasing mortgage rates  softening of the housing market and losses in the subprime mortgage market 
the vast majority of these companies are rated a or better by s p  moody s or fitch  and all continue to pay dividends demonstrating their financial stability 
although we cannot predict future stock prices  our management expects that the financial services sector and the s p index will continue to recover and that these stocks may recover along with the overall index 
we also have the ability and intent to hold these investments for the forecasted recovery period 
whether or not we classify an investment as temporarily impaired or other than temporarily impaired has no effect on our basic consolidated financial statements ie  balance sheet  statement of earnings  statement of cash flows and statement of shareholders equity because the investments are marked to market value each quarter and are included in the financial statements at current market value in accordance with our accounting under financial accounting standards board interpretations number r  consolidation of variable interest entities fin r 
the classification only affects the footnote presentation 
the cost basis of investments classified as other than temporarily impaired is reduced to market value in the adjusted cost basis column in notes  and  whereas other investments are included in that column at their actual cost basis 
we perform a separate analysis to determine whether our preneed contracts are in a loss position  which would necessitate a charge to earnings 
for this analysis  we determine which trusts are in a net loss position by comparing the aggregate market value of the trust s investments with the aggregate actual cost basis of the investments 
if the aggregate cost basis exceeds the aggregate market value of the investments  the trust is considered to be in a net loss position 
for trusts in a net loss position  we add the sales prices of the underlying contracts and net realized earnings  then subtract net unrealized losses to derive the net amount of proceeds for 
table of contents contracts associated with the trusts in question as of that particular balance sheet date 
we look at unrealized gains and losses based on current market prices quoted for the investments  but we do not include future expected returns on the investments in our analysis 
we compare the amount of proceeds to the estimated costs to deliver the contracts  which consist primarily of merchandise costs 
if a deficiency were to exist  we would record a charge to earnings and a corresponding liability for the expected loss on the delivery of those contracts from our backlog 
due to the margins of our preneed contracts and the trust portfolio returns we have enjoyed  there is currently substantial capacity for additional market depreciation before a contract loss would result 
cash impact of preneed sales the impact of preneed sales on near term cash flow depends primarily on the commissions paid on the sale  the timing of the tax payments on the sale  the portion of the sale required to be placed into trust and the terms of the particular contract such as the size of the down payment required and the length of the contract 
we generally pay commissions to our preneed sales counselors based on a percentage of the total preneed contract price  but only to the extent cash is paid by the customer 
if the initial cash installment paid by the customer is not sufficient to cover the entire commission  the remaining commission is paid from subsequent customer installments 
however  because we are required to place a portion of each cash installment paid by the customer into trust  we may be required to use our own cash to cover a portion of the commission due on the installment from the customer 
accordingly  preneed sales are generally cash flow negative initially but become cash flow positive at varying times over the life of the contract  depending upon the trusting requirements and the terms of the particular contract 
commissions related to preneed funeral and preneed cemetery services and merchandise sales are expensed as incurred 
see note b to the consolidated financial statements included in item for a discussion of the change in accounting for preneed selling costs in fiscal year overview of critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions see note b to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  the following are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgment 
deferred revenue and revenue recognition funeral revenue is recognized when funeral services are performed 
our funeral receivables included in current receivables primarily consist of amounts due for funeral services already performed 
we sell price guaranteed prearranged funeral contracts through various programs providing for future funeral services at prices prevailing when the agreements are signed 
revenues associated with sales of prearranged funeral contracts  which include accumulated trust earnings and increasing insurance benefits  are deferred until such time that the funeral services are performed see note i to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
revenue associated with cemetery merchandise and services is recognized when the service is performed or merchandise is delivered 
revenue associated with preneed cemetery property interment rights is recognized in accordance with the retail land sales provision of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 revenue from constructed cemetery property is not recognized until a minimum percentage percent of the sales price has been collected 
revenue related to the preneed sale of cemetery property prior to its construction is recognized on a percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue associated with sales of preneed merchandise and services is not recognized until the merchandise is delivered or the services are performed see note j to the consolidated financial statements included in item 
we defer all dividends and interest earned and net capital gains and losses realized by preneed funeral trust and preneed cemetery merchandise trust accounts until the underlying service or the merchandise is delivered 

table of contents variable interest entities we consolidate our preneed funeral and cemetery merchandise and services trusts and our cemetery perpetual care trusts 
for a more detailed discussion of our accounting policies after the implementation of fin r  see notes k and through to the consolidated financial statements included in item allowance for doubtful accounts and sales cancellations management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable 
we establish a reserve for uncollectible installment contracts and trade accounts based on a range of percentages applied to accounts receivable aging categories 
these percentages are based on an analysis of historical collection and write off experience 
in addition  we establish a reserve for sales cancellations for cemetery property sales based on historical cancellations and recent write off activity 
this reserve is recorded as a reduction in cemetery revenue 
we also establish an allowance for cancellations of insurance commissions based on historical experience for cancellations of insurance contracts within the period of refundability 
these estimates are impacted by a number of factors  including changes in the economy and demographic or competitive changes in our areas of operation 
if circumstances change  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could change by a material amount 
depreciation of long lived assets buildings and equipment are recorded at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  primarily using the straight line method 
buildings and building improvement items are generally depreciated over a period ranging from to years 
equipment including computer equipment  light equipment  heavy equipment and crematory equipment is generally depreciated over periods ranging from three to years 
vehicles are generally depreciated over five to seven years 
leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the term of the lease or the life of the asset 
these estimates of the useful lives may be affected by such factors as changes in regulatory requirements or changing market conditions 
valuation of long lived assets we review the carrying value of our long lived assets whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
this review is based on our projections of anticipated undiscounted future cash flows and compares the estimated undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by those assets to the carrying amount of those assets 
the net carrying value of any assets not fully recoverable would be reduced to fair value 
while we believe that our estimates of undiscounted future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows and comparable sales values could materially affect our evaluations 
valuation of goodwill in our determination of reporting units for goodwill impairment testing purposes  both qualitative and quantitative characteristics are evaluated 
gross margins are analyzed for purposes of determining whether or not our operating divisions are considered economically similar 
our division presidents also review a variety of metrics when assessing the performance of our regions 
qualitative factors include the nature of our products and services  consistency of products and services and the delivering of those products and services in our funeral homes and cemeteries  the similarity of class of customers across all locations and regulations in different jurisdictions 
based on our evaluation  we have reporting units 
see note g to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information 
goodwill of a reporting unit must be tested for impairment on at least an annual basis 
we conduct our annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in addition to an annual review  we assess the impairment of goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may be greater than its fair value 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of the use of our assets or the strategy for our overall business and significant negative industry or economic trends 

table of contents in reviewing goodwill for impairment  we first compare the fair value of each of our reporting units with their carrying amounts including goodwill 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit including goodwill exceeds its fair value  we then measure the amount of impairment of the reporting unit s goodwill by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill determined in a business combination 
that is  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
the excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
an impairment charge is recorded when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
our goodwill impairment test involves estimates and management judgment using a discounted cash flow valuation methodology 
step two of our impairment test involves determining estimates of the fair values of our assets and liabilities 
we may obtain assistance from third parties in assessing the fair value of certain of our assets  primarily real estate  in performing our step two analysis 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record further impairment charges for these assets 
goodwill amounted to million and million as of october  and  respectively 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
the following items are reviewed to determine if a valuation allowance is required net operating losses federal  state and us possessions  capital loss carry forwards and deferred tax assets federal  state and us possessions 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of earnings 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change our allowance  which could materially impact our financial condition and results of operations 
preneed selling costs on may   we changed our method of accounting for preneed selling costs incurred related to the acquisition of new prearranged funeral and cemetery service and merchandise sales to expense these costs as incurred instead of deferring and amortizing these costs 
we have applied this change in accounting principle effective november  prior to this change  commissions and other costs that varied with and were primarily related to the acquisition of new prearranged funeral and cemetery service sales and prearranged funeral and cemetery merchandise sales were deferred and amortized in proportion to the preneed revenue recognized in the period in a manner consistent with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for insurance companies 
we decided to change our accounting for preneed selling costs to expense such costs as incurred 
we concluded that expensing these costs as they are incurred would be preferable to the old method because it will make our reported results more comparable with other public death care companies  better align the costs of obtaining preneed contracts with the cash outflows associated with obtaining such contracts and eliminate the burden of maintaining deferred selling cost records 
estimated insurance loss liabilities we purchase comprehensive general liability  automobile liability and workers compensation insurance coverages structured within a large deductible self insured retention premium rating program 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs and losses covered by these policies 
historical insurance industry experience indicates some degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate 
table of contents amount of losses associated with the types of claims covered by the program 
this is especially true due to the extended period of time that transpires between when the claim might occur and the full settlement of such claim  often many years 
we continually evaluate the receivables due from our insurance carriers as well as loss estimates associated with claims and losses related to these insurance coverages with information obtained from our primary insurer 
with respect to health insurance that covers substantially all of our employees  we purchase individual and aggregate stop loss coverage with a large deductible 
this program results in the company being primarily self insured for claims and associated costs up to the amount of the deductible  with claims in excess of the deductible amount being covered by insurance 
expected claims are based on actuarial estimates  actual claims may differ from those estimates 
we continually evaluate our claims experience related to this coverage with information obtained from our insurer 
assumptions used in preparing these estimates are based on factors such as claim settlement patterns  claim development trends  claim frequency and severity patterns  inflationary trends and data reasonableness 
together these factors will generally affect the analysis and determination of the best estimate of the projected ultimate claim losses 
the results of these evaluations are used to assess the reasonableness of our insurance loss liability 
the estimated liability on the uninsured litigation and employment related claims are established by management based upon the recommendations of professionals who perform a review of both reported claims and estimate a liability for incurred but not reported claims 
these liabilities include the estimated settlement costs 
although management believes estimated liabilities related to uninsured claims are adequately recorded  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the recorded liabilities 
we also have insurance coverage related to property damage  incremental costs and property operating expenses we incurred due to damage caused by hurricane katrina 
our policy is to record such amounts when recovery is probable which generally means we have reached an agreement with the insurance company 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item we accrue for legal costs related to loss contingencies as the services are provided 
if a settlement is determined to be probable  then an estimate is recorded for the settlement at that time 
results of operations the following discussion segregates the financial results of our continuing operations into our various segments  grouped by our funeral and cemetery operations 
for a discussion of discontinued operations  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for a discussion of our segments  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item as there have been no material acquisitions or construction of new locations in fiscal years and  results from continuing operations reflect those of same store locations

funeral trust earnings recognized with respect to preneed contracts delivered included in funeral revenue for and were million and million  respectively 
consolidated operations funeral total funeral revenue from continuing operations decreased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in our same store businesses achieved a percent increase in the average revenue per traditional funeral service and a percent increase in the average revenue per cremation service 
the increase in the average revenue per traditional funeral and cremation service were partially offset by a shift in mix to lower priced cremation services 
this resulted in an overall percent increase in the average revenue per funeral service in our same store businesses 
the cremation rate for our same store operations was percent for the year ended october  compared to percent for the year ended october  we also recorded million in funeral revenue related to an out of period adjustment and million in business interruption insurance proceeds related to the hurricanes for the year ended october  we 
table of contents experienced a percent decrease in the number of funeral services performed by our same store businesses  or  events out of the  total same store events performed 
we believe the primary factors contributing to the increases in our average revenue per traditional and cremation service were normal inflationary price increases  more effective merchandising and packaging  and our focus on training and personalization 
funeral gross profit from continuing operations decreased from million in the year ended october  to million in the year ended october  due primarily to the decreases in revenue discussed above and a million increase in expenses 
the increase in expenses is primarily due to an increase in property  casualty and general liability insurance costs  along with a million impairment charge related to funeral licenses in the state of maryland 
prior to october  funeral licenses in the state of maryland were restricted to a specific number that had previously been limited under maryland law 
the law changed in october  and these restrictions are no longer in place  therefore  the value of these assets has been impaired  and an impairment charge was recorded 
segment discussion funeral funeral revenue in the eastern division funeral segment increased primarily due to an increase in the same store average revenue per funeral service of percent 
the increase in average revenue is partially offset by a percent decrease in the number of funeral services performed by our same store businesses 
for fiscal year  funeral revenue in the western division segment was increased by a million out of period adjustment and million in business interruption insurance proceeds related to the hurricanes 
the western division experienced a percent decrease in the number of funeral services performed by our same store businesses  partially offset by an increase in the same store average revenue per funeral service of percent 
funeral revenue in the corporate trust management segment increased million primarily due to an increase of million in trust management fees and million in funeral trust earnings 
funeral gross profit for the eastern division funeral segment decreased primarily due to an increase in expenses 
the increase in expenses is primarily due to an increase in property  casualty and general liability insurance costs along with a million impairment charge for funeral licenses in the state of maryland  as described above 
funeral gross profit for the western division funeral segment decreased primarily due to the decrease in revenue as discussed above without a corresponding decrease in expenses 
expenses for the western division funeral segment would have decreased more significantly were it not for an increase in property  casualty and general liability insurance

perpetual care trust earnings are included in the revenues and gross profit of the related geographic segment 
consolidated operations cemetery cemetery revenue from continuing operations increased million  or percent  for the year ended october   compared to the corresponding period in  primarily due to an increase in construction during the period on various cemetery projects and an increase in gross cemetery property sales 
the increase is due in part to serving customers interested in large cemetery property purchases such as private estates 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in merchandise delivery revenues due in part to a decrease in interments and an increase in the reserve for cancellations  which was due in part to an improvement in the reserve for cancellations in the prior year following hurricane katrina 
gross cemetery property sales increased percent for the year ended october  compared to the year ended october  from million to million and represent the aggregate contract price of cemetery property sale contracts entered into during the period

see note and to the consolidated financial statements included in item for information regarding the cost basis and market value of those trust assets and the current performance of the trusts ie current realized gains and losses  interest income and dividends 
segment discussion cemetery cemetery revenue in the eastern division cemetery segment increased primarily due to an increase in construction during the year on various cemetery projects  partially offset by a decrease in merchandise delivery revenue 
cemetery revenue in the western division cemetery segment increased primarily due to increases in cemetery property sales  partially offset by a decrease in merchandise delivery revenue 
cemetery revenue in the corporate trust management segment increased million primarily due to a million increase in trust management fees and a million increase in trust earnings recognized upon the delivery of preneed cemetery merchandise and services 
cemetery gross profit for the eastern division decreased primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with the increase in revenue and due to an increase in property  casualty and general liability insurance costs 
cemetery gross profit for the western division increased due to increases in revenue noted above and due to out of period adjustments in fiscal year which had a million positive impact to gross profit 
discontinued operations included in discontinued operations for the year ended october  were gains on dispositions  net of impairment losses  of million compared to million recognized for the year ended october  revenues for fiscal year were million compared to million in fiscal year the effective tax rate for our discontinued operations for the year ended october  was a percent expense compared to a 
table of contents percent benefit for the same period in for additional information  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in item other for the year ended october   hurricane related charges  net of recoveries  increased million from net recoveries of million in fiscal year to net charges of million in fiscal year these charges were due to repairs at locations damaged by hurricane katrina 
the timing of the receipt of insurance proceeds is not in line with the timing of cash spending related to hurricane katrina 
we could incur immaterial hurricane related charges in the first quarter of fiscal year  but do not expect any material hurricane related charges after that 
for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item interest expense decreased million to million for the year ended october  compared to million for the same period in due primarily to a basis point decrease in the average interest rate during the year 
the decrease in the average rate is primarily due to additional interest incurred in fiscal year on the company s percent senior notes as a result of the company s inability to timely complete a required exchange offer and due in part to the reduction in interest resulting from the issuance of million of senior convertible notes 
the effective tax rate for our continuing operations for the year ended october  was percent compared to percent for the year ended october  the reduced rate in fiscal year was primarily caused by a tax benefit of million attributable to the utilization of a capital loss carryforward  coupled with a tax benefit of million attributable to the completion and settlement of an audit by the commonwealth of puerto rico for tax periods  and for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item we experienced an million decrease in current receivables and a increase in long term receivables from october  to october  the decrease in current receivables is primarily due to declines in insurance receivables
