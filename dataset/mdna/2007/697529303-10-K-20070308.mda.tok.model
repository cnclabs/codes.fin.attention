the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report 
historical results and percentage relationships among any amounts in the financial statements are not necessarily indicative of trends in operating results for any future periods 
critical accounting policies our policies are more fully described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue in accordance with securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
we recognize product revenues upon shipment 
if a product sale does not meet all of the above criteria  the revenue from the sale is deferred until all criteria are met 
provisions are made at the time of revenue recognition for any applicable warranty costs expected to be incurred 
periodically  we sell products together with a product upgrade option that requires that the customer pay an upgrade fee at the time of exercise  has no refund provisions and includes an expiration date on the upgrade option 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we defer the fair value ascribed to the upgrade option until the expiration of the upgrade option or the exercise of the upgrade option and shipment of the product upgrade 
revenues from the sale of service contracts is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the service contract 
revenues from services administered by us that are not covered by a service contract are recognized as the services are provided 
in certain instances  we sell products together with service contracts 
we recognize revenue on such multiple element arrangements in accordance with sab and eitf  based on the relative fair market value of each element 
we generally recognize royalty revenue from licensees upon receipt of cash payments since the royalty amounts are not determinable at the end of a quarter 
licensees are obligated to make payments between and days after the end of each quarter 
if at the end of a quarter  royalty revenue from licenses are determinable we record royalty revenue during the period earned 
periodically  as we sign on new licensees  in the period determinable and earned we recognize back owed royalties 
we have the right under our license agreements to engage independent auditors to review the royalty calculations 
the amounts owed as a result of these audits may be higher or lower than previously recognized 
we have funded product development revenue from the development agreements with gillette  johnson johnson consumer companies  inc and the united states department of the army 
for both gillette and johnson johnson  we have received payments quarterly in accordance with the work plans that were developed with both gillette and johnson johnson 
revenue is recognized under the contracts as costs are incurred and services are rendered 
any amounts received in advance of costs incurred and services rendered are recorded as deferred revenue 
payments are not refundable if the development is not successful 
we provide services under a million research contract with the united states department of the army to develop a light based self treatment device for pseudofolliculitis barbae or pfb 
the contract is a cost plus fee arrangement whereby we are reimbursed for the expenses incurred in connection with pfb research plus an fee 
revenue is recognized under the contract as the costs are incurred and the services are rendered 
our revenue from the contract is subject to government audit 
accounts receivable reserves 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
in establishing the appropriate provisions for customer receivable balances  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider a a customer s ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments  b a customer s current and projected financial condition  c the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and d the economy in general 
once we consider all of these factors  a determination is made as to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is made  which takes into account the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on our experience in collecting these amounts 
our level of reserves for our customer accounts receivable fluctuates depending upon all of the factors mentioned above 
we provide a general reserve for doubtful accounts based on the aging of our accounts receivable balances  historical experiences of write offs and defaults 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns and allowances on product and service related sales in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based on the specific facts and circumstances of particular order  analysis of credit memo data and other known factors 
if the data we use to calculate these estimates do not properly reflect reserve requirements  then a change in the allowances would be made in the period in which such a determination is made and revenues in that period could be adversely affected 
inventory reserves 
as a designer and manufacturer of high technology equipment  we may be exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  reliability and replacement of and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
our policy is to establish inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
included in our inventory are demonstration products that are used by our sales organization 
we account for such products as we do with any other finished goods item in our inventory in accordance with the review of our entire inventory 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales or usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
assumptions used in determining our estimates of future product demand may prove to be incorrect  in which case the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory would have to be adjusted in the future 
if inventory is determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such as cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we perform a detailed review of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
additionally  purchasing requirements and alternative usage avenues are explored within these processes to mitigate inventory exposure 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
warranty provision 
we typically offer a one year warranty for all of our base products 
we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time product revenue is recognized 
factors that affect our warranty reserves include the number of units sold  historical and anticipated rates of warranty repairs and the cost per repair 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our estimated warranty obligation is affected by ongoing product failure rates  specific product class failures outside of our baseline experience  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
assumptions and historical warranty experience are evaluated to determine the appropriateness of such assumptions 
we assess the adequacy of the warranty provision and we may adjust this provision if necessary 
stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values at the date of grant 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative 
on january   we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method as permitted under sfas r 
under this transition method  compensation cost recognized in includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to but not yet vested as of december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas in accordance with the modified prospective method of adoption  our results of operations and financial position for prior periods have not been restated 
as permitted under sfas no 
and sfas r  we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option grants 
key input assumptions used to estimate the fair value of stock options include the exercise price of the award  the expected option term  the expected volatility of our stock over the option s expected term  the risk free interest rate over the option s expected term and our expected annual dividend yield 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our common stock and other factors  the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns  and the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods corresponding with the expected life of the option 
our assumed dividend yield of zero is based on the fact that we have never paid cash dividends and have no present intention to pay cash dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods  or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes model  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
the guidance in sfas r is relatively new and the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
prior to december   we followed the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the provisions of sfas no 
allowed companies to either expense the estimated fair value of stock options or to continue to follow the intrinsic value method set forth in accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  but disclose the pro forma effects on net income had the fair value of the options been expensed 
we elected to apply apb in accounting for our stock option incentive plans 
in accordance with apb and related interpretations  compensation expense for stock options was recognized in income based on the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of the stock at the grant date of the award or other measurement date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
generally  the exercise price for stock options granted to employees was equal to the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant  thereby resulting in no recognition of compensation expense by us prior to december  income taxes 
we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we regularly review deferred tax assets for recoverability taking into consideration such factors as historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires us to maintain a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
for  we removed the valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets based on the conclusion that there was sufficient positive evidence to support that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax asset would be realized 
this resulted in a non cash  million tax benefit recorded through our provision for income taxes 
in addition to the tax assets described above  we have deferred tax assets totaling million  resulting from the exercise of employee stock options 
in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
r  recognition of these assets would occur upon utilization of these deferred tax assets to reduce taxes payable and would result in a credit to additional paid in capital within stockholders equity rather than the provision for income taxes 
for  and the impact to paid in capital resulting from the exercise of employee stock options was million   and  respectively 
in evaluating the potential exposure associated with the various tax filing positions  we accrue charges for possible exposures 
based on the annual evaluations of tax positions  we believe we have appropriately filed our tax returns and accrued for possible exposures 
to the extent we were to prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or be required to pay amounts in excess of reserves  our effective tax rate in a given financial period might be materially impacted 
overview we are engaged in research  development  manufacturing and distribution of proprietary light based systems for hair removal and other cosmetic treatments 
since our inception  we have been able to develop a differentiated product mix of light based systems for cosmetic treatments through our research and development as well as with our partnerships throughout the world 
we are continually developing and testing new indications to further the advancement in cosmetic light based treatments 
during  we improved product gross profits by due to a higher margin product mix and the effects of increased sales volume in comparison to the same period in we strengthened our balance sheet since the end of  including increasing our cash and investment position by and stockholders equity by 
our current ratio is now x  up from x at the end of  and we have no debt 
our revenues for the year ended december   were million  up from million for the year ended december  gross profit from product sales increased to million of product revenues  up from million of product revenues in the year earlier period 
we also reported net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december   versus net income of million  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  sales from our lux family of products remained strong throughout and our product revenue increased each quarter as compared to the lux line of products consists of the starlux laser and pulsed light system  the medilux and the estelux pulsed light systems  including a base unit and multiple  optional handpieces 
the lux family of products contains some of the most versatile systems in the market today 
the investments that we made in the past into new technologies have paid off as the demand for our lux family continued to increase in results of operations year compared to year the following table contains selected income statement information  which serves as the basis of the discussion of our results of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands  except for percentages to amount as a of total revenues amount as a of total revenues change change revenues product revenues    royalty revenues    funded product development revenues    total revenues    cost and expenses cost of product revenues    cost of royalty revenues    research development    selling marketing    general administrative   total costs and expenses    income from operations    interest income    income before income taxes    provision benefit for income taxes  net income    product revenues 
sales of our starlux laser and pulsed light systems  including a base unit and multiple  optional handpieces were the leading contributor to our increase in product revenues 
product revenues were favorably impacted by an increase of in sales related to the starlux laser and pulsed light system and an increase of in revenue related to customer service  offset by a decrease of related to the other lux family of products  which includes the medilux and estelux  and a decrease of from sales related to the q yag product line as compared to the same period in starlux product sales increased as more customers opted for the higher powered  faster and more versatile starlux systems that are capable of utilizing both laser and lamp based applications to treat various cosmetic conditions 
customer service revenue increased as an increased number of customers purchase replacement handpieces 
the decline in revenues from other lux products was directly attributable to the customer acceptance of the starlux product line and its additional laser and light based handpieces 
international product revenue  consisting of sales by our independent sales agents in canada and distributors in japan  europe  australia  asia pacific rim and south and central america and our sales shipped directly to international customers was of total product revenue for the year ended in comparison to for the same period in while international product sales increased in absolute dollars in compared to  they declined as a percentage of revenues due to the much larger increase in domestic product sales 
royalty revenues 
royalty revenues increased during in comparison to the same period in this increase is attributed to the execution of a new patent license agreement with cynosure  a royalty audit of laserscope providing back owed royalties from laserscope s product sales from january  through june  and the settlement of our patent infringement lawsuits against cutera  offset by lumenis making its final installment for back owed royalties during the fourth quarter in for the year ended december   lumenis made current royalty payments to us of approximately million 
for the year ended december   lumenis made current royalty payments to us of approximately million and approximately million for back owed royalties recorded as royalty revenue 
on june   we announced the resolution of our patent infringement lawsuits against cutera through the execution of a settlement agreement and a non exclusive patent license agreement 
under the license agreement  we granted cutera a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to the anderson patents in the professional field  excluding the consumer field which is exclusively licensed to gillette 
cutera admitted that their products infringe the anderson patents and that these patents are valid and enforceable 
in addition  cutera agreed not to challenge the infringement  validity and enforceability of the anderson patents in the future 
cutera paid us million as an estimated payment for royalties due on past sales of their laser and lamp based hair removal systems beginning with their initial sales in through march   interest and reimbursement of our legal costs 
cutera subsequently informed us that they believed the actual liability for past royalties  interest and legal costs was million  versus the actual payment of million 
we recorded the difference of million as deferred revenue at june  to be applied against future amounts owed  which was fully recognized as royalty revenue as of december  the final amounts due were subject to audit by an independent accounting firm which was completed during the fourth quarter  resulting in an additional  of royalty and interest 
starting on april   cutera began paying us royalties on sales of its existing light based hair removal systems  and cutera will pay us royalties on sales of its later developed light based hair removal systems 
for the year ended december  we recognized million of royalty revenues from cutera 
on october   we entered into a new non exclusive patent license agreement with laserscope and terminated our prior license agreement with them 
under the new license agreement  laserscope pays us a royalty on sales of its current light based hair removal products  including the lyra and gemini laser systems and the solis ipl system  as well as on sales of new light based hair removal systems developed in the future 
as a result of a royalty audit of laserscope s product sales from january  through june   there was an increase in the third quarter royalty revenue of million for back owed royalties 
for the years ended december  and  we recognized million and  of royalty revenues from laserscope  respectively 
american medical systems holdings  inc acquired laserscope in july of and subsequently sold the assets of laserscope s aesthetic division to iridex corporation  effective in the first quarter of as a result  the license agreement between palomar and laserscope has been assigned to iridex 
iridex has assumed all of laserscope s rights and obligations under the license agreement 
on november   we announced the execution of a non exclusive patent license agreement with cynosure  inc under this agreement  we granted to cynosure a non exclusive  royalty bearing license to the anderson patents and foreign counterparts 
in return cynosure granted us a non royalty bearing fully paid up  non exclusive license to eight cynosure patents and patent applications  including counterparts 
cynosure also paid us million on november  as royalties on sales of their laser and lamp based hair removal systems made before october  beginning october   cynosure will pay us royalties on sales of its light based hair removal systems as well as future developed hair removal systems 
for the year ended december  we recognized million of royalty revenue from cynosure 
funded product development revenues

the contract is a cost plus fee arrangement whereby we are reimbursed for the expenses incurred in connection with pfb research plus an fee 
revenue is recognized under the contract as the costs are incurred and the services are rendered 
during and  we recognized approximately million and million  respectively  of funded product development revenues from the united states department of the army 
cost of product revenues 
the cost of product revenues increased in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of product revenue to in from in the increase in absolute dollars was attributed to a shift in product mix to the higher priced starlux laser and pulsed light system  additional handpieces and a shift in product sales to north america and by a net decrease in cost of product revenues as a result of a non recurring adjustment made to product royalties offset by the write off of certain customer service loaner inventory 
in addition  increased sales volume has improved the absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead at our manufacturing facility as approximately of our manufacturing overhead cost is fixed in nature and is spread over much higher sales volumes 
cost of royalty revenues

interest income 
interest income increased due to the increase in cash balances and the settlement of our patent infringement lawsuits against cutera where cutera paid us approximately million net of what was paid to the massachusetts general hospital in interest in comparison to the same period in provision benefit for income taxes 
the income tax benefit for fiscal year was approximately million  which consisted of a million non cash federal and state valuation allowance release offset by federal and state income taxes of approximately million 
based on current and preceding years results of operations and anticipated profit levels in future periods  we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and  accordingly  that it was appropriate to release the valuation allowance recorded against those deferred tax assets 
in reaching this conclusion  we weighed both negative and positive evidence regarding the realizability of these deferred tax assets and considered the extent to which the evidence could be objectively verified 
we expect that in  our effective tax rate will be more in line with combined federal and state statutory rates 
during  we provided approximately a effective tax rate for anticipated federal alternative minimum taxes and minimum state income taxes due for year compared to year the following table contains selected income statement information  which serves as the basis of the discussion of our results of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands  except for percentages to amount as a of total revenues amount as a of total revenues change change revenues product revenues    royalty revenues   funded product development revenues   total revenues    cost and expenses cost of product revenues    cost of royalty revenues   research development    selling marketing    general administrative    total costs and expenses    income from operations    interest income   income before income taxes    provision benefit for income taxes  net income    product revenues

the cost of product revenues increased in absolute dollars  but decreased as a percentage of product revenue to in from in the increase in absolute dollars is directly attributable to increased variable costs associated with increased product sales 
this cost decreased as a percentage of total revenue primarily due to a shift in sales mix to the higher priced  higher margin starlux laser and pulsed light system 
the lux family of products carry lower manufacturing costs as a result of their modular design 
in addition  increased sales volume has improved the absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead at our manufacturing facility as approximately of our manufacturing overhead cost is fixed in nature and is spread over much higher sales volumes 
cost of royalty revenues 
as a percentage of royalty revenues  the cost of royalty revenues was consistent at in accordance with our license agreement with massachusetts general hospital for each period in comparison to the same periods in the increase in the cost of royalty revenues in absolute dollars is attributed to our settlement agreement with lumenis

the increase in research and development expense is a direct result of our spending related to the gillette agreement  the johnson johnson consumer companies  inc agreement and the research contract with the united states department of the army and our continued commitment to introducing new platforms and enhancing our current family of products 
for our research and development agreement with gillette  costs related to payroll and payroll related expenses increased by  material costs increased by  and other clinical  consulting and overhead expenses decreased by  as compared to the same period in for our research agreement with the united states department of the army  costs related to payroll and payroll related expenses increased by  material costs decreased by  and other clinical  consulting and overhead expenses decreased by  as compared to the same period in expenses relating to the johnson johnson consumer companies  inc agreement totaled approximately million for the year ended december  the johnson johnson consumer companies  inc agreement began in october of and we incurred minimal expenses relating to this project in expenses relating to the introduction of new products  enhancements made to our current family of products and research and development overhead increased by  for the twelve months ended december   in comparison to the same period in selling and marketing expense

general and administrative expense 
the increase in general and administrative dollars is mainly attributed to increases to incentive compensation of million related to our incentive compensation plan of  a decrease of  in costs related to corporate governance as more costs were incurred in as it was our first year of complying with section of the sarbanes oxley act of  an increase in our corporate legal expenses of approximately  and an increase in payroll and payroll related expenses and other infrastructure costs of approximately  as compared to the same period in interest income 
interest income increased due to higher levels of cash on hand as well as higher interest rates in comparison to the same periods in provision benefit for income taxes 
during  we provided approximately a effective tax rate for anticipated federal alternative minimum taxes and minimum state income taxes due for during  we recognized a benefit from income taxes of  as a result of a million reduction in deferred income tax accruals associated with tax deductions in a state tax return which were no longer required 
offsetting these benefits  we provided a effective tax rate for anticipated federal alternative minimum taxes and minimum state income taxes due for we have net operating loss carryforwards that can be utilized to offset future income for federal and state tax purposes
