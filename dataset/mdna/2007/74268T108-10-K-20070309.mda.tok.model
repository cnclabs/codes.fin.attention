overview procentury is a holding company that underwrites selected property and casualty and surety insurance through its subsidiaries collectively known as century insurance group 
as a niche company  we offer specialty insurance products designed to meet specific insurance needs of targeted insured groups 
the excess and surplus lines market provides an alternative market for customers with hard to place risks and risks that insurance companies licensed by the state in which the insurance policy is sold  which are also referred to as admitted insurers  specifically refuse to write 
when we underwrite within the excess and surplus lines market  we are selective in the lines of business and types of risks we choose to write 
typically  the development of these specialty insurance products is generated through proposals brought to us by an agent or broker seeking coverage for a specific group of clients 
we evaluate our insurance operations by monitoring key measures of growth and profitability 
the following provides further explanation of the key gaap measures that we use to evaluate our results written and unearned premium 
written premium is recorded based on the insurance policies that have been reported to us and beginning in  the policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us 
we must estimate the amount of written premium not yet reported based on judgments relative to current and historical trends of the business being written 
such estimates will be regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments will be included in the current year s results 
an unearned premium reserve is established to reflect the unexpired portion of each policy at the financial reporting date 
for additional information regarding our written and unearned premium refer to notes and to our audited consolidated financial statements  both included in this report 
the majority of our business is placed directly through agents 
since the vast majority of the company s gross written premium is primary or direct as opposed to assumed direct in  in and in the delays in reporting assumed premium generally do not have a significant effect on the company s financial statements 
we also record the ceded portion of the estimated gross written premium and related acquisition costs 
the earned gross  ceded and net premiums are calculated based on our earning methodology which is generally pro rata over the policy periods 
losses are also recorded in relation to the earned premium 
the estimate for losses incurred on the estimated premium is based on an actuarial calculation consistent with the methodology used to determine incurred but not reported loss reserves for reported premiums 
beginning in  a portion of the company s premium is estimated for unreported premium and premiums received by us but not yet processed 
of the million of gross written premium recorded in  million or was estimated 
such premium estimates are generally based on submission data received from agents and recorded when the insurance policy or reinsurance contract is bound and written 
the estimates are regularly reviewed and updated taking into account the premium received to date versus the estimate and the age of the estimate 
to the extent that the actual premium varies from the estimates  the difference  along with the related loss reserves and underwriting expenses  is recorded in current operations 
loss ratio 
loss ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of losses and loss expenses incurred to premiums earned 
loss ratio generally is measured on both a gross direct and assumed and net gross less ceded basis 
we use the gross loss ratio as a measure of the overall underwriting profitability of the insurance business we 
table of contents write and to assess the adequacy of our pricing 
our net loss ratio is meaningful in evaluating our financial results  which are net of ceded reinsurance  as reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
expense ratio 
expense ratio is the ratio expressed as a percentage of net operating expenses to premiums earned and measures a company s operational efficiency in producing  underwriting and administering its insurance business 
we reduce our operating expenses by ancillary income excluding net investment income and realized gains losses on securities to calculate our net operating expenses 
due to our historically high levels of reinsurance  we calculate our expense ratio on both a gross basis before the effect of ceded reinsurance and a net basis after the effect of ceded reinsurance 
although the net basis is meaningful in evaluating our financial results that are net of ceded reinsurance  as reflected in our consolidated financial statements  we believe that the gross expense ratio better reflects the operational efficiency of the underlying business and is a better measure of future trends 
interest expense is not included in the calculation of the expense ratio 
combined ratio 
combined ratio is the sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio and measures a company s overall underwriting profit 
if the combined ratio is at or above  an insurance company cannot be profitable without investment income and may not be profitable if investment income is insufficient 
we use the combined ratio in evaluating our overall underwriting profitability and as a measure for comparing our profitability relative to the profitability of our competitors 
critical accounting policies it is important to understand our accounting policies in order to understand our financial statements 
management considers certain of these policies to be critical to the presentation of our financial results  since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the period being reported upon 
certain of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates  which would be reflected in future periods 
material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term relate to the determination of loss and loss expense reserves  the recoverability of deferred policy acquisition costs  the determination of federal income taxes  the net realizable value of reinsurance recoverables  and the determination of other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
although considerable variability is inherent in these estimates  management believes that the amounts provided are reasonable 
these estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as necessary 
such adjustments are reflected in current operations 
loss and loss expense reserves 
loss and loss expense reserves represent an estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of losses based on facts and circumstances then known 
we use actuarial methodologies to assist us in establishing these estimates  including judgments relative to estimates of future claims severity and frequency  length of time to develop to ultimate resolution  judicial theories of liability and other third party factors that are often beyond our control 
due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the cost of unsettled and unreported claims  the ultimate liability may be different from the original estimate 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current period s results 
additional information regarding our loss and loss expense reserves can be found in results of operations expenses losses and loss expenses incurred  business loss and loss expense reserves  and note to our audited consolidated financial statements  all of which are included in this report 
reinsurance recoverables 
reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses  net  are established for the portion of our loss and loss expense reserves that are ceded to reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverables are determined based in part on the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts which could be subject to interpretations that differ from our own based on judicial theories of liability 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers that can be significant considering that certain of the reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
we are required to pay losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
see business reinsurance and note to our audited consolidated financial statements  both included in this report 

table of contents impairment of investments 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed to be other than temporary 
under the company s accounting policy for equity securities and fixed maturity securities that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in a way that may limit the company s ability to fully recover cost  an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary unless the company has both the ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period until the security s forecasted recovery and evidence exists indicating that recovery will occur in a reasonable period of time 
for other fixed maturity and equity securities  an other than temporary impairment charge is taken when the company does not have the ability and intent to hold the security until the forecasted recovery or if it is no longer probable that the company will recover all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security 
many criteria are considered during this process including  but not limited to  the current fair value as compared to amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  of the security  the amount and length of time a security s fair value has been below amortized cost or cost  specific credit issues and financial prospects related to the issuer  the company s intent to hold or dispose of the security  and current economic conditions 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction to the cost basis of the underlying investment 
additionally  for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows including asset backed securities  fasb emerging task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  requires us to periodically update our best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
if management determines that the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then an other than temporary impairment is recognized 
for additional detail regarding our investment portfolio at december  and  including disclosures regarding other than temporary declines in investment value  see investment portfolio below and note to our audited consolidated financial statements  both included in this report 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
we defer commissions  premium taxes and certain other costs that vary with and are primarily related to the acquisition of insurance contracts 
these costs are capitalized and charged to expense in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value  which gives effect to the premium to be earned  related investment income  anticipated losses and settlement expenses and certain other costs expected to be incurred as the premium is earned 
judgments as to ultimate recoverability of such deferred costs are highly dependent upon estimated future loss costs associated with the written premiums 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
federal income taxes 
the company provides for federal income taxes based on amounts the company believes it ultimately will owe 
inherent in the provision for federal income taxes are estimates regarding the deductibility of certain items and the realization of certain tax credits 
in the event the ultimate deductibility of certain items or the realization of certain tax credits differs from estimates  the company may be required to significantly change the provision for federal income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
any such change could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated statements of income 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income tax 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized

table of contents results of operations the table below summarizes certain operating results and key measures we use in monitoring and evaluating our operations 
the information is intended to summarize and supplement information contained in our consolidated financial statements and to assist the reader in gaining a better understanding of our results of operations years ended december  in thousands selected financial data gross written premiums net premiums earned net investment income net realized investment gains losses other income total revenues total expenses other transactions discontinued operations net income key financial ratios loss and loss expense ratio expense ratio combined ratio overview of operating results year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income was for the year ended december   compared to net income of for the year ended december  the increase in net income for the year ended december  was primarily attributable to a increase in total revenue in as a result of higher net earned premium and net investment income 
the impact of the increase in revenue on net income was also supplemented by a percentage points decrease in the total combined ratio in as compared to the lower combined ratio is primarily due to a decrease in losses that were incurred related to prior years and hurricanes when comparing to approximately of our revenue growth was due to a increase in net earned premium as a result of an increase in the volume of business that was partially offset by slight rate declines in the property line of business and supported by relatively flat rates in our casualty business 
while our core property and casualty business continued to grow in  the most significant areas of growth were a result of higher volume of program business and the continued growth in contractors business written on a claims made form 
in addition to our net earned premium growth  our net investment income grew by in compared to the same period in this growth was due to continued favorable cash flows from operations during the year ended december  and higher investment yields which on a tax equivalent basis increased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in higher expenses that resulted from an increase in net loss and loss expenses and amortization of deferred acquisition costs partially offset the increase in total revenue 
this increase in overall expenses is a direct result of the growth in the volume of business produced in and is partially offset by an increase in the profitability of the business written as seen in an overall decrease in the combined ratio as compared to the combined ratio in this decrease in the overall combined ratio is a direct result of a percentage point decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio that decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in as previously stated  the decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio for year ended december  
table of contents compared to the same periods in resulted from higher net incurred loss and loss expenses in due to million of unfavorable development in related to prior accident years and a significantly worse hurricane season in than in that resulted in million of additional losses 
we recorded million favorable prior year development in the expense ratio for year ended december  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in the expense ratio for the year ended december  is directly attributable the fact that the expense ratio was impacted by of expense related to the severance agreement with our former chief operating officer which was recorded in the first quarter of no severance expense was incurred in in addition  the overall expense ratio was impacted by slightly higher acquisition costs included in the amortization of deferred acquisition costs which was offset by a decrease in the other expense ratio due to expense efficiencies gained as a result of the fact that our fixed costs have not increased at the same rate as our earned premium 
in addition  on september   the securities exchange commission staff released staff accounting bulletin sab regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements that were uncorrected in prior years 
following the release of sab  we reviewed all of our accounting practices and did not identify any items that were considered to be a material misstatement of prior year financial statements 
we did  however  make immaterial adjustments  one of which changed the timing of recording gross written premiums 
in the past  we recorded premiums on a received and processed basis  which did not take into account premiums written by agents but not yet submitted to us 
under our revised accounting policy  which was implemented in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an estimate of the policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us 
these adjustments had the following impacts on the results for both the quarter and year ended december  premiums in the course of collection  deferred policy acquisition costs  loss and loss expense reserves and unearned premiums were higher by million  million  million  and million  respectively 
gross written premiums  net written premiums and premiums earned were million higher  million higher and million higher  respectively 
losses and loss expenses  the amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and other operating expenses were higher by million  and  respectively 
net income was higher by  or per diluted share 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we reported net income of million for the year ended december  compared to net income of million for the same period in included in the net income for is million of after tax losses related to the fall hurricane season 
prior to  hurricane losses have not had a significant impact to net income 
without the impact of the hurricanes  net income would have increased over as a direct result of our growth in our net premiums earned and an increase in our investment income 
more specifically  our net premiums earned increased to million in from million in included in this increase is growth in our gross written premium from our casualty segment of and from our property segment 
our casualty business continues to grow profitably with stable rates and a current accident year loss and loss expense ratio of 
the property market in general did not perform as well as the casualty market given the downward pricing pressure from standard carriers that began in and continued into despite this tighter market  we were still able to grow while only slightly decreasing our average rate 
the loss and loss expense ratio for the property business was  which included related to the fall hurricane season 
in addition  we reported a increase in net investment income from million in to million in this increase is a result of our operating cash flows and higher pretax investment yields 
in addition  we continued our efforts in to increase our after tax yield by increasing our allocation to tax exempt municipal bonds 
as a result of the relationship between our pretax income  which was adversely affected by the 
table of contents hurricane losses  and an increase in our tax exempt municipal bonds  we reported an annual effective tax rate of in compared to in the combined ratio increased to in from in our loss and loss expense ratio increased percentage points primarily as a result of the hurricane losses and the slight premium rate decrease that resulted late in and into the first half of in addition  included in our loss and loss expenses is million in incurred amounts related to prior accident years compared to million in our expense ratio increased percentage points in from in to at the end of this increase is a direct result of our efforts in our first year of required compliance with sarbanes oxley section revenues premiums premiums include insurance premiums underwritten by our insurance subsidiaries which are referred to as direct premiums and insurance premiums assumed from other insurers which are referred to as assumed premiums 
we refer to direct and assumed premiums together as gross premiums 
written premiums are the total amount of premiums billed to the policyholder less the amount of premiums returned  generally because of cancellations  during a given period 
written premiums become premiums earned as the policy ages 
barring premium changes  if an insurance company writes the same mix of business each year  written premiums and premiums earned will be equal  and the unearned premium reserve will remain constant 
during periods of growth  the unearned premium reserve will increase  causing premiums earned to be less than written premiums 
conversely  during periods of decline  the unearned premium reserve will decrease  causing premiums earned to be greater than written premiums 
written premium is recorded based on the insurance policies that have been reported to us and beginning in  the policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us 
we must estimate the amount of written premium not yet reported based on judgments relative to current and historical trends of the business being written 
such estimates will be regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments will be included in the current year s results 
an unearned premium reserve is established to reflect the unexpired portion of each policy at the financial reporting date 
we have historically relied on quota share  excess of loss  and catastrophe reinsurance primarily to manage our regulatory capital requirements and to limit our exposure to loss 
generally  we have ceded a significant portion of our premiums to unaffiliated reinsurers in order to maintain net written premiums to statutory surplus ratio of less than to our underwriting business is currently divided into two primary segments property casualty  and other including exited lines 
our property casualty segment primarily includes general liability  commercial property and multi peril insurance for small and mid sized businesses 
the other including exited lines segment primarily includes our surety business  including landfill and specialty surety that is written in order to maintain century s us treasury listing 

table of contents the following table presents our gross written premiums in our primary segments and provides a summary of gross  ceded and net written premiums and net premiums earned for the periods indicated 
years ended december  in thousands gross written premiums property casualty other including exited lines total gross written premiums ceded written premiums net written premiums net premiums earned net written premiums to gross written premiums net premiums earned to net written premiums net writings ratio  including discontinued operations the ratio of net written premiums including discontinued operations to our insurance subsidiaries combined statutory surplus 
this ratio is not restated to exclude discontinued operations for the year ended december   as the insurance subsidiaries combined statutory surplus is not allocated by line of business 
therefore  in computing the ratio of net written premiums to our insurance subsidiaries combined statutory surplus we did not restate the net written premium for discontinued operations to be consistent with that of the subsidiaries combined statutory surplus 
management believes this measure is useful in gauging our exposure to pricing errors in the current book of business 
it may not be comparable to the definition of net writings ratio used by other companies 
gross written premiums year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross written premiums increased for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this fluctuation for the year was to the result of in growth the property casualty segment from all of our product lines  but primarily from an increase in volume from our specialty program unit and an increase in our casualty book of business from growth in our contractor business written on a claims made form 
our program unit introduced an auto physical damage program in mid that has increased our property business by million throughout in addition  in january  we stopped writing contractors business written on an occurrence form and began to offer contractors liability coverage on a claims made form 
the claims made contractors coverage has a significantly shorter claim reporting period  which should result in less reserve variability and more predictable results 
the initial impact of ceasing to write contractors on an occurrence form caused a decrease in premium writings on our contractors book in the market for contractors written on a claims made form did  however  begin to improve late in and into causing an increase in our casualty premiums of million during the growth in our property casualty segment was slightly offset by minimal rate decline in property business while casualty rates remained stable 
in addition  our gross written premiums for the year ended december   includes an one time adjustment of million related to the initial booking of policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us  as discussed earlier in the overview section 
gross written premium for the other including exited lines segment increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this increase represents surety business written in order to maintain the company s us treasury listing 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross written premiums increased million or for the year ended december  compared to the same period in this increase was due primarily to increased business in our property casualty segment  which increased million or 
the growth in the property casualty segment resulted principally from an increase in volume in our casualty

net written and earned premiums year ended december  compared to year ended december  net written premiums increased by for the year ended december   respectively  compared to the same period in due to the growth in gross written premiums 
net written premiums represented of gross written premiums for the year ended december   which is relatively the same as the relationship of net written premiums to gross written premiums for the year ended december  our net written premiums for the year ended december   includes an adjustment of million related to the initial booking of policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to us  as discussed earlier in the overview section 
premiums earned increased by to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the year 
premiums earned as a percentage of net written premiums was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the relationship of premiums earned to net written premiums during the year ended december  was lower compared to the same period in as a result of the fact that beginning in  we are including an estimate of the premiums not yet received from our agents in our total gross and net written premium 
as the majority of this premium is expected to have effective dates in december  the premiums are estimated to be less than a month earned  resulting in a lower overall relationship of premiums earned to net written premiums 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net written premiums for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of compared to the same period in net written premiums were of gross written premiums for the year ended december   which is slightly higher than the year ended december   net premiums earned  a function of net written premiums  amounted to million for the year ended december  and equaled of net written premiums compared to in this increase directly related to a stabilization of the rate of growth in net investment income our investment portfolio generally consists of liquid  readily marketable and investment grade fixed maturity and equity securities 
net investment income is primarily comprised of interest and dividend earned on these securities  net of related investment expenses 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net investment income was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase was due to an increase in invested assets  including cash  and higher investment yields 
invested assets  including cash  increased by million to million as of december  from million as of december  the pre tax investment yield for the year ended december  was  compared to for the same period in for the year ended december  and  the taxable equivalent yield was and  respectively 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net investment income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the increase was the result of an increase in investments and cash balances  as well as higher investment yields 
due to an increase in our operating cash flows  the investment portfolio and cash increased to million as of december   which is an increase of million from december  our average investment yield for was  compared to for the same period in on a tax equivalent yield basis  our yield increased to in compared to in 
table of contents realized gains losses on securities realized gains and losses on securities are principally affected by changes in interest rates  the timing of sales of investments and changes in credit quality of the securities we hold as investments 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  we realized net investment gains of  on the sale and write down of securities for the year ended december  compared to  of net realized losses for the year ended december  other than temporary losses of million were recorded during the year ended december  other than temporary losses of  were included in the net realized investment losses for the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  during the year ended december   we incurred net realized losses of  on the sale and write down of securities compared to  in net realized gains for the year ended december  included in the realized net losses in was  related to other than temporary impairments for two securities 
there were no impairment losses in expenses losses and loss expenses losses and loss expenses represent our largest expense item and include payments made to settle claims  estimates for future claim payments and changes in those estimates for current and prior periods  and costs associated with settling claims 
the items that influence the incurred losses and loss expenses for a given period include  but are not limited to  the following the number of exposures covered in the current year  trends in claim frequency and claim severity  changes in the cost of adjusting claims  changes in the legal environment relating to coverage interpretation  theories of liability and jury determinations  and the re estimation of prior years reserves in the current year 
we establish or adjust for prior accident quarters our best estimate of the ultimate incurred losses and loss expenses to reflect loss development information and trends that have been updated for the most recent quarter s activity through quarterly internal actuarial analysis 
as of december of each year  we have an independent actuarial analysis performed of the adequacy of our reserves 
our estimate of ultimate loss and loss expenses is evaluated and re evaluated by accident year and by major coverage grouping and changes in estimates are reflected in the period the additional information becomes known 
our reinsurance program significantly influences our net retained losses 
in exchange for premiums ceded to reinsurers under quota share and excess of loss reinsurance agreements  our reinsurers assume a portion of the losses and loss expenses incurred 
see business reinsurance 
we remain obligated for amounts ceded in the event that the reinsurers do not meet their obligations under the agreements due to  for example  disputes with the reinsurer or the reinsurer s insolvency

in  we determined that the december  net reserve for losses and loss expenses of after the effects of reinsurance was redundant by million 
this favorable development is detailed in the chart above and further discussed in the segment information below

in  we concluded  through our actuarial analysis  that the december  net reserve for losses and loss expenses of after the effects of reinsurance was deficient by million 
net loss and loss expenses incurred increased to million for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  in  we recorded million of incurred losses and loss expenses attributable to the accident year and million of unfavorable prior year development 
in  we recorded million of incurred losses and loss expense attributable to the accident year and million of unfavorable prior year development 
net loss and loss expense ratios were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
segment property casualty casualty 
our changes in the reserve estimates related to prior accident years for the years ended december   and for the casualty lines resulted in increases in incurred losses and loss expenses of million  million  and million  respectively 
a significant portion of our casualty reserves development relates to construction defect claims in certain states 
starting with california in december  we began to exit contractors liability business written on an occurrence form 
by the end of the first quarter of  we had significantly reduced our contractors liability written on an occurrence form underwriting in all states  and completely eliminated contractors liability written on an occurrence form in arizona  california  colorado  hawaii  louisiana  nevada  new jersey  north carolina  oregon  south carolina and washington 
reserves and claim frequency on this business may be impacted by decisions by california and other states courts affecting insurance law and tort law 
they may also be impacted by legislation enacted in california 
this legislation continues to impact claim severity and frequency assumptions underlying our reserves 
accordingly  our ultimate liability may exceed or be less than current estimates due to this variable  among others 
during  as a result of court decisions that further defined the legal environment in california  we decided to enhance its defense strategy in for certain types of construction defect claims 
as a result  we revised the construction defect defense team by retaining appellate and new trial counsel and restaffing the in house team responsible for management of the litigation 
once the new legal teams were established late in and into  it was determined that there were certain cases that should be settled and the defense budgets for the remaining cases had to be revised to reflect the added resources  resulting in higher than expected loss and defense costs in this strategy continued in and we incurred additional legal expenses when litigation discovery procedures yielded new information about the underlying claims 
this new information required a reassessment of expected settlements or judgments and expenses on many suits that had been received in prior years with this continued development related to our construction defect claims in as well as a small amount of adverse development on our non construction defect casualty claims  our internal actuaries continued to refine their actuarial reserving techniques concerning the weighting of reserve indications and supplemental information concerning claims severities 
as a result  our casualty reserves moved to a higher point on the range of loss and loss expense reserve estimate 
we also recorded approximately million of unfavorable development during the year ended december  related to estimated costs associated with possible reinsurance collection issues on two separate casualty claims 
our net loss and loss expense reserves for construction defects as of december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the re estimation of construction defect reserves for 
table of contents the years ended december  and primarily affected the and accident years and the to accident years 
as of december   we had open claims relating to construction defects  compared to and open claims as of december  and  respectively 
during  new claims were reported and existing claims were settled or dismissed 
as of december   the projected loss and loss expense ratios  after the effects of reinsurance  for the casualty lines were  and for accident periods  and our internal actuaries generally apply actuarial techniques in the analysis of loss and loss expense reserves using the following factors  among others our experience and the industry s experience  historical trends in reserving patterns and loss payments  the impact of claim inflation  the pending level of unpaid claims  the cost of claim settlements  the line of business mix  and the environment in which property and casualty insurance companies operate 
although many factors influence the actual cost of claims and our corresponding reserve estimates  we do not measure and estimate values for all of these variables individually 
this is due to the fact that many of the factors that are known to impact the cost of claims cannot be measured directly  such as the impact on claim costs due to economic inflation  coverage interpretations and jury determinations 
in most instances  we rely on our historical experience or industry information to estimate values for the variables that are explicitly used in our reserve analyses 
we assume that the historical effect of these unmeasured factors  which is embedded in our experience or industry experience  is representative of future effects of these factors 
where we have reason to expect a change in the effect of one of these factors  we perform analysis to quantify the necessary adjustments 
for claim liabilities other than construction defect  our internal actuaries apply multiple traditional actuarial techniques to determine loss and loss expense reserve estimates 
each technique produces a unique loss and loss expense reserve estimate for the line being analyzed 
the set of techniques applied produces a range of loss and loss expense reserve estimates 
from these estimates  the actuaries form a best estimate which considers the assumptions and factors that influence ultimate claim costs  including but not limited to those identified above 
as of december   for casualty lines  other than construction defect claims  the low end of the range of techniques was below the actuarial best estimate  and the high end of the range of techniques was above the actuarial best estimate 
these low and high loss and loss expense reserve estimates reflect the fact that the methodologies applied do not produce identical estimates  and these estimates do not constitute the range of all possible outcomes

for construction defect claim liabilities  our internal actuaries apply one actuarial technique  under various sets of assumptions  which considers the factors that influence ultimate claim costs 
the actuarial technique for construction defect claim liabilities includes several variables relating to the number of ibnr claims and the average cost per ibnr claim 
in addition to computing best estimate parameter values for the actuarial projection  the actuaries also consider the impact on resulting ibnr related to reasonably foreseeable fluctuations in these variables  which is used to quantify an range of techniques of loss and loss expense reserves for construction defect 
as of december   for construction defect claims the low end of the range of techniques was below the actuarial best estimate and the high end of the range of techniques was above the actuarial best estimate 
these low and high loss and loss expense reserve estimates reflect the uncertainty in estimating the parameter values  and these estimates do not constitute the range of all possible outcomes

property 
our changes in reserve estimates for the years ended december   and for the property lines resulted in favorable development of million  million and million  respectively  for the property lines 
these amounts primarily relate to changes in the selected development patterns on multiple accident years  as the number of claims and claim severity were below expectations at december   and as of december   the projected loss and loss expense ratios  after the effects of reinsurance  for the property lines were  and for accident periods  and our internal actuaries apply multiple actuarial techniques utilizing the same factors discussed above under casualty to determine loss and loss expense reserve estimates for property claim liabilities 
each technique produces a unique loss and loss expense reserve estimate for the line being analyzed 
the set of techniques applied produces a range of loss and loss expense reserve estimates 
from these estimates  the actuaries form a best estimate that considers assumptions and factors  as discussed above  that influence ultimate claim costs 
as of december   for property lines the low end of the range of techniques was below the actuarial best estimate and the high end of the range of techniques was above the actuarial best estimate

year ended december  compared to year ended december  for the year ended december   we experienced an increase in our adac portion of the expense ratio due to a lower amount of acquisition expenses that were able to be deferred related to the auto physical damage program 
during the third quarter of  the loss and loss expense ratio related to this program exceeded our expectations causing the program to fall below the profitability levels required for continued deferral of the additional policy acquisition costs 
this resulted in  of additional amortization expense for the year ended december  there were no such expenses during the year ended december  the increase in the adac portion of the expense ratio for the year ended december  was offset by the commutation of certain and prior contingent commission contracts that lowered the other operating expense portion of the expense ratio 
there were no commutations of contingent commission contracts in in response to the lower than expected performance of the auto physical damage program  we tightened the underwriting selection guidelines  and increased premium rates to yield a decrease in the loss and loss expense ratio 
we also decreased the commissions paid to the agent from to 
these changes were designed to increase the profitability of this program to meet our expectations 
interest expense continues to increase based on the increase in interest rates on our variable rate trust preferred securities  due to the current interest rate environment 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  operating expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in the majority of the increase was due million in additional amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs that is a direct result of the growth in our overall book of business

although we have the capacity to generate cash through loans from banks and issuances of equity securities  our primary source of funds to meet our short term liquidity needs  including the payment of dividends to our shareholders and corporate expenses  is dividends from century 
century s principal sources of funds are underwriting operations  investment income  proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and dividends from pic 
century s primary use of funds is to pay claims and operating expenses  to purchase investments and to make dividend payments to us 
procentury s future liquidity is dependent on the ability of century to pay dividends 
our insurance subsidiaries are restricted by statute as to the amount of dividends it may pay without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
century and pic may pay dividends without advance regulatory approval only from unassigned surplus and only to the extent that all dividends in the current twelve months do not exceed the greater of of total statutory surplus as of the end of the prior fiscal year or statutory net income for the prior year 
using these criteria  the available ordinary dividend available to be paid from century to procentury during is million 
the ordinary dividend available to be paid from pic to century during is million 
century paid ordinary dividends of million in  million in  and million in in addition  century paid million of extraordinary dividend in related to the dividend distribution of evergreen 
pic has not paid any dividends to century in or century s ability to pay future dividends to procentury without advance regulatory approval is dependent upon maintaining a positive level of unassigned surplus  which in turn  is dependent upon century generating net income in excess of dividends to procentury 
our insurance subsidiaries are required by law to maintain a certain minimum level of surplus on a statutory basis 
surplus is calculated by subtracting total liabilities from total admitted assets

century s statutory surplus including pic s surplus at december  was million and the authorized control level was million 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is due to our growth of gross written premiums and investment income  which was partially offset by an increase in the amount of claim payments as a result of the hurricane season and quicker claim payouts related to the auto physical damage program  as it has a much shorter tail than our other property and casualty business 
consolidated net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease is a result of a larger amount of cash at the end of that had not yet been invested 
consolidated net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash used by financing activities of approximately million for the same period in this increase is primarily the result of additional draws on the line of credit in compared to  which was contributed to century to supplement century s capital base in response to the significant growth in gross written premium 
the increase in net cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by an increase in dividends to per share during year ended december  compared to per share during the year ended december  year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in receivable from subsidiary available for sale that was received in no such amounts were received in net cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the net cash used by investing activities was higher in because the proceeds from the ipo were used to purchase fixed maturities and equity securities 
net cash used by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  this fluctuation was attributable to the proceeds from the issuance of common shares related to the ipo  which was partially offset by the redemption of class b shares and principal payment on long term debt in the following table summarizes information about our contractual obligations and commercial commitments

given our historical cash flow  we believe cash flow from operating activities in will provide sufficient liquidity for our operations  as well as to satisfy debt service obligations and to pay other operating expenses 
although we anticipate that we will be able to meet our cash requirements  we can give no assurance in this regard

changes in estimated cash flows due to changes in prepayment assumptions from the original purchase assumptions are revised based on current interest rates and the economic environment 
we had no derivative financial instruments  real estate or mortgages in the investment portfolio at december  under our accounting policy for equity securities and fixed maturity securities that can be contractually prepaid or otherwise settled in a way that may limit our ability to fully recover cost  an impairment is deemed to be other than temporary unless we have both the ability and intent to hold the investment for a reasonable period until the security s forecasted recovery and evidence exists indicating that recovery will occur within a reasonable period of time 
for other fixed maturity and equity securities  an other than temporary impairment charge is taken when we do not have the ability or intent to hold the security until the forecasted recovery or if it is no longer probable that we will recover all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security 
many criteria are considered during this process including  but not limited to  the current fair value as compared to amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  of the security  the amount and length of time a security s fair value has been below amortized cost or cost  specific credit issues and financial prospects related to the issuer  our intent to hold or dispose of the security  and current economic conditions 
additionally  for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows including asset backed securities  fasb emerging task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  requires the company to periodically update its best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
if management determines that the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then an other than temporary impairment is recognized 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction to the cost basis of the underlying investment

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
the major components of market risk affecting us are credit risk  equity price risk and interest rate risk 
credit risk 
credit risk is the potential economic loss principally arising from adverse changes in the financial condition of a specific debt issuer 
we attempt to address this risk by investing in fixed maturity securities that are either investment grade  which are those bonds rated bbb or higher by standard poor s or securities that although not investment grade  meet our credit requirements and targeted risk adjusted return 
we also 
table of contents independently and through our outside independent investment managers  monitor the financial condition of all of the issuers of fixed maturity securities in our portfolio 
we utilize a rating change report  a rating watch report and a focus list as part of this process 
finally  we employ stringent diversification rules that limit our credit exposure to any single issuer 
equity price risk 
equity price risk is the potential that we will incur economic loss due to decline in common stock prices 
we attempt to manage this risk by focusing on a long term  conservative  value oriented  dividend driven investment philosophy for our equity portfolio 
the equity securities in our portfolio are primarily mid to large capitalization issues with strong dividend performance 
our strategy remains one of value investing  with security selection taking precedence over market timing 
we also employ stringent diversification rules that limit our exposure to any individual stock 
interest rate risk 
we had fixed maturity  preferred shares and bond mutual fund investments with a fair value of million at december  that are subject to interest rate risk 
we attempt to manage our exposure to interest rate risk through a disciplined asset liability matching and capital management process 
in the management of this risk  the characteristics of duration  credit and variability of cash flows are critical elements 
these risks are assessed regularly and balanced within the context of our liability and capital position
