item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s financial review tabular dollars in millions  except per share data overview the pepsi bottling group  inc pbg or the company is the world s largest manufacturer  seller and distributor of pepsi cola beverages 
when used in these consolidated financial statements  pbg  we  our and us each refers to the pepsi bottling group  inc and  where appropriate  to bottling group  llc bottling llc  our principal operating subsidiary 
we have the exclusive right to manufacture  sell and distribute pepsi cola beverages in all or a portion of the us  mexico  canada and europe  which consists of our operations in spain  greece  russia and turkey 
in  pbg changed its financial reporting methodology to three reportable segments us canada  europe and mexico 
operationally  the company is organized along geographic lines with specific regional management teams having responsibility for the financial results in each reportable segment 
the company has restated segment information contained in the results of operations section of this report to conform to the current segment reporting structure 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our segments 
as shown in the graph below  the us canada segment is the dominant driver of our results  generating of our volume  of our net revenues and of our operating income 
bar graph at the core of pbg s business are the products we sell 
our products are some of the world s best known brands  which span virtually every non alcoholic liquid beverage category 
the majority of our volume is derived from brands licensed from pepsico  inc pepsico or joint ventures in which pepsico participates 
in some of our territories we have the right to manufacture  sell and distribute soft drink products of companies other than pepsico  including dr pepper and squirt 
we also have the right in some of our territories to manufacture  sell and distribute beverages under trademarks that we own  including electropura  e pura mr and garci crespo 
see part i  item of the non financial section of this report for a listing of our principal products by segment 
we sell our products through either a cold drink or take home channel 
our cold drink channel consists of chilled products sold in the retail and foodservice channels 
we earn the highest profit margins on a per case basis in the cold drink channel 
our take home channel consists of unchilled products that are sold in the retail  mass and club channels for at home future consumption 
our products are brought to market primarily through direct store delivery dsd or third party distribution  including foodservice and vending distribution networks 
the hallmarks of pbg s dsd system are speed to market  flexibility and reach  all critical factors in bringing new products to market  adding accounts to our existing base and meeting increasing volume demands 
our customers span from large format accounts  including large chain foodstores  supercenters  mass merchandisers  chain drug stores  club stores and military bases to small independently owned shops and foodservice businesses 

table of contents among the services we provide to our customers are proven methods to grow not only pepsico brand sales  but the overall beverage category 
ultimately  our goal is to help our customers grow their beverage business by making our product line up readily available 
we measure our sales in terms of physical cases as sold to our customers 
each package  regardless of configuration or number of units within a package sold to a customer  represents one physical case 
our net price and gross margin on a per case basis are impacted by how much we charge for the product  the mix of brands and packages we sell  and the channels in which the product is sold 
for example  we realize a higher net revenue and gross margin per case on a ounce chilled bottle sold in a convenience store than on a liter unchilled bottle sold in a grocery store 
our financial success is dependent on a number of factors  including our strong partnership with pepsico  the customer relationships we cultivate  the pricing we achieve in the marketplace  our market execution  our ability to meet changing consumer preferences and the efficiency we achieve in manufacturing and distributing our products 
key indicators of our financial success are the number of physical cases we sell  the net price and gross margin we achieve on a per case basis  and our overall cost productivity  which reflects how well we manage our raw material  manufacturing  distribution and other overhead costs 
management s financial review is provided below and organized in the following sections critical accounting policies relationship with pepsico items that affect historical or future comparability financial performance summary results of operations liquidity and financial condition and market risks and cautionary statements 
the discussion and analysis throughout management s financial review should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in our consolidated financial statements and the related accompanying notes  including various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  taxes  environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of business 
we use our best judgment  the advice of external experts  our knowledge of existing facts and circumstances and actions that we may undertake in the future  in determining the estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap often requires us to make judgments  estimates  and assumptions regarding uncertainties that affect the results of operations  financial position and cash flows of the company  as well as the related footnote disclosures 
management bases its estimates on knowledge of our operations  markets in which we operate  historical trends  future expectations and other assumptions 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are those policies which management believes are most important to the portrayal of pbg s financial condition and results of operations and require the use of estimates  assumptions and the application of judgment 
management has reviewed these critical accounting policies and related disclosures with the audit and affiliated transactions committee of our board of directors 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable  sales return trend analysis  detailed analysis of high risk customer accounts  overall market environment and financial conditions of our customers 
estimating an allowance for doubtful accounts requires significant management judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
accordingly  we estimate the amounts necessary to provide for losses on receivables by using quantitative and qualitative measures  including historical write off experience  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss  and adjusting for changes in economic conditions in which we and our customers operate 
actual collections of accounts receivable could differ from management s estimates due to changes in future economic or industry conditions or specific customers financial condition 
recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives our intangible assets principally arise from the allocation of the purchase price of businesses acquired  and consist primarily of franchise rights  distribution rights  brands and residual goodwill 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets classifies intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with finite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill  which is not amortized 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
tests for impairment are performed only if a triggering event indicates the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives  tests for impairment are performed at least annually or more frequently if a triggering event indicates the assets may be impaired 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment at a reporting unit level 
a reporting unit can be an operating segment or a business within an operating segment component 
based on an evaluation of our reporting units  we determined that the countries in which we operate are our reporting units 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value 
we measure the fair value of a reporting unit as the discounted estimated future cash flows  including a terminal value  which assumes the business continues in perpetuity 
our long term terminal growth assumptions reflect our current long term view of the marketplace 
our discount rate is based upon our weighted average cost of capital for each reporting unit 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we compare the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount to measure the amount of impairment loss 
in determining whether our intangible assets have an indefinite useful life  we consider the following as applicable the nature and terms of underlying agreements  our intent and ability to use the specific asset  the age and market position of the products within the territories we are entitled to sell  the historical and projected growth of those products  and costs  if any  to renew the agreement 
we evaluate intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  including franchise rights  distribution rights and brands we own for impairment by comparing the estimated fair values with the carrying values 
the fair value of our franchise rights and distribution rights is measured using a multi period excess earnings method that is based upon estimated discounted future cash flows 
the fair value of our brands is measured using a multi period royalty savings method  which reflects the savings realized by owning the brand and  therefore  not having to pay a royalty fee to a third party 
in the fair value calculation of these intangibles we use a discount rate that is based upon the reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital plus an additional risk premium to reflect the risk and uncertainty inherent in separately acquiring the identified intangible asset between a willing buyer and a willing seller 
the additional risk premium associated with our discount rate 
table of contents effectively eliminates the benefit that we believe results from synergies  scale and our assembled workforce  all of which are components of goodwill 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows in conducting an impairment test for goodwill and other identified intangible assets  which may be impacted by future actions taken by us and our competitors and the volatility in the markets in which we conduct business 
an inability to achieve strategic business plan targets in a reporting unit  a change in our discount rate  or other assumptions within our cash flow models could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units and other intangible assets  which could then result in a material impairment charge to our results of operations 
in mexico  we have approximately billion of intangible assets on our balance sheet 
prior to  mexico did not meet our profit expectations 
while mexico has met our profit expectations in  an impairment charge could be required in the future if we do not achieve our long term expected results there 
we will continue to closely monitor our performance in mexico and evaluate the realizability of each intangible asset 
for further information about our goodwill and intangible assets see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension and postretirement medical benefit plans we sponsor pension and other postretirement medical benefit plans in various forms in the united states and similar plans outside the united states  covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement medical benefit plans using actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
effective for our fiscal year ending  we adopted the balance sheet provisions of this standard and recognized the funded status of each of the pension and postretirement medical plans we sponsor in the united states and other similar plans we sponsor outside the united states 
accordingly  we recorded a decrease of approximately million  net of taxes and minority interest  to our shareholders equity due to the adoption of sfas the assets  liabilities and expense associated with our international plans were not significant to our results of operations  and accordingly  assumptions and sensitivity analyses regarding these plans are not included in the discussion below 
assumptions our us employees participate in non contributory defined benefit pension plans  which cover substantially all full time salaried employees  as well as most hourly employees 
assumptions and estimates are required to calculate the expenses and obligations for these plans including discount rate  expected return on plan assets  retirement age  mortality  turnover  health care cost trend rates and compensation rate increases 
we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors on an annual basis and we believe that they are appropriate 
our assumptions are based upon historical experience of the plan and expectations for the future 
these assumptions may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions 
an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a material impact on reported net income and the related funding requirements 
the discount rate is a significant assumption and is derived from the present value of our expected pension and postretirement medical benefit payment streams 
the present value is calculated by utilizing a yield curve that matches the timing of our expected benefit payments 
the yield curve is developed by our actuarial advisers using a portfolio of several hundred high quality non callable corporate bonds 
the bonds are rated aa or better by moody s and have at least million in principal amount 
the bonds are denominated in us dollars and have maturity dates ranging from six months to thirty years 
once the present value of all the expected payment streams has been calculated  a single discount rate is determined 
the fiscal year weighted average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans is percent and percent  respectively 
the expected return on plan assets is important  since a portion of our defined benefit pension plans is funded 
in evaluating the expected rate of return on assets for a given fiscal year  we consider the actual to year 
table of contents historic returns on asset classes in our pension investment portfolio  reflecting the weighted average return of our asset allocation and use them as a guide for future returns 
our target asset allocation for our us pension assets is percent equity investments  of which approximately percent is invested in domestic equities and percent is invested in foreign equities 
the remaining percent of our plan assets is invested primarily in fixed income securities  which is equally divided between us government and corporate bonds 
our current portfolio s target asset allocation for the and year periods had weighted average returns of percent and percent  respectively 
over time  the expected rate of return on pension plan assets should approximate the actual long term returns 
based on the historic and estimated future returns of our portfolio  we estimate the long term rate of return on assets for our domestic pension plans to be percent in the cost or benefit of plan changes  such as increasing or decreasing benefits for prior employee service  is deferred and included in expense on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of the employees expected to receive benefits 
gains and losses have resulted from changes in actuarial assumptions and from differences between assumed and actual experience  including among other items  changes in discount rates  actual returns on plan assets as compared to assumed returns  and changes in compensation increases 
differences between assumed and actual returns on plan assets are amortized on a straight line basis over five years and are recognized in the net periodic pension calculation over five years 
to the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceeds percent of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets  such amount is amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants 
net unrecognized losses  within our pension and postretirement plans in the united states  totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the following table provides our current and expected weighted average assumptions for our pension and postretirement medical plans expense in the united states pension discount rate expected return on plan assets net of administrative expenses rate of compensation increase postretirement discount rate rate of compensation increase health care cost trend rate during  our company sponsored defined benefit pension and postretirement medical plan expenses in the united states totaled million 
in  our ongoing expenses will decrease by approximately million to million as a result of the combination of the following factors an increase in our weighted average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical expense from percent and percent to percent and percent  respectively  reflecting increases in the yields of long term corporate bonds comprising the yield curve 
this change in assumption will decrease our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately million 
a change to our mortality assumption to reflect six years of projected mortality improvement will increase our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately million 
other changes will increase our defined benefit pension and postretirement medical expenses by approximately million 
these changes include certain benefit plan modifications  demographic changes and reflection of actual asset returns 

table of contents sensitivity analysis it is unlikely that in any given year the actual rate of return will be the same as the assumed long term rate of return of percent 
the following table provides a summary of the last three years of actual returns versus the expected long term returns for our us pension plans expected return on plan assets net of administrative expenses actual return on plan assets net of administrative expenses sensitivity of changes in key assumptions for our us pension and postretirement plans expense in are as follows discount rate a basis point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease the expense for our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans in by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a basis point change in the expected return on plan assets would increase or decrease the expense for our pension plans in by approximately million 
the postretirement medical benefit plans have no expected return on plan assets as they are funded from the general assets of the company as the payments come due 
for further information about our pension and postretirement plans and the adoption of sfas see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
casualty insurance costs due to the nature of our business  we require insurance coverage for certain casualty risks 
in the united states  we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity  which participates in a reinsurance pool to provide for workers compensation and automobile risks for occurrences up to million  and product and general liability risks for occurrences up to million 
for losses exceeding these self insurance thresholds  we purchase casualty insurance from a third party provider 
our liability for casualty costs is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
we do not discount our loss expense reserves 
these estimates are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency and are subject to a significant degree of inherent variability 
we evaluate these estimates with our actuarial advisors periodically during the year and we believe that they are appropriate  although an increase or decrease in the estimates or events outside our control could have a material impact on reported net income 
accordingly  the ultimate settlement of these costs may vary significantly from the estimates included in our financial statements 
for further information about our casualty insurance costs see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
share based compensation effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
among its provisions  sfas r requires the company to recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the award s grant date fair value 
historically  we offered stock option awards as our primary form of long term incentive compensation 
these stock option awards generally vest over three years and have a year term 
the company uses the black scholes merton option valuation model to value stock option awards 
beginning in  we granted a combination of stock option awards and restricted stock units to our middle and senior management and our board of directors 
the fair value of restricted stock unit awards is based on the fair value of pbg stock on the date of grant 
each restricted stock unit award generally vests over three years and is settled in shares of pbg stock after the vesting period 
the black scholes merton valuation model for our stock option awards estimates the potential value the employee will receive based on current interest rates  expected time at which the employee will exercise the award and the expected volatility of the company s stock price 
these assumptions are based on historical experience and future expectations of employee behavior and stock price 

table of contents another significant assumption utilized in calculating our share based compensation is the amount of awards that we expect to forfeit 
compensation expense is recognized only for share based payments expected to vest and we estimate forfeitures  both at the date of grant as well as throughout the vesting period  based on the company s historical experience and future expectations 
changes in our assumptions utilized to value our stock options and forfeiture rates could materially affect the amount of share based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
for the year ended december   the adoption of sfas r reduced our diluted earnings per share by approximately 
we expect a similar impact to our diluted earnings per share for for further information about our share based compensation see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefits and costs we expect to realize 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
a significant portion of deferred tax assets consists of net operating loss carryforwards nols 
we have nols totaling  million at december   which are available to reduce future taxes in the us  spain  greece  russia  turkey and mexico 
the majority of our nols are generated overseas  the largest of which is coming from our mexican and spanish operations 
of these nols  million expire in and  million expire at various times between and significant management judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax position 
we establish tax reserves when  based on the applicable tax law and facts and circumstances relating to a particular transaction or tax position  it becomes probable that the position will not be sustained when challenged by a taxing authority 
a change in our tax reserves could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
under our tax separation agreement with pepsico  pepsico maintains full control and absolute discretion for any combined or consolidated tax filings for tax periods ended on or before our initial public offering that occurred in march however  pepsico may not settle any issue without our written consent  which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld 
pepsico has contractually agreed to act in good faith with respect to all tax examination matters affecting us 
in accordance with the tax separation agreement  we will bear our allocable share of any risk or benefit resulting from the settlement of tax matters affecting us for these tax periods 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a tax contingency reserve is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years for which we have audits that are open varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
the us internal revenue service irs is currently examining pbg s and pepsico s joint tax returns for through march the statute of limitations for the irs audit of pbg s tax returns closed on december   and we released approximately million in tax contingency reserves relating to such audit 
the irs is currently examining pbg s tax returns for the and tax years 
while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution  we believe that our tax reserves reflect the probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
favorable resolutions would be recognized as a reduction of our tax expense in the year of resolution 
for further information about our income taxes see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
relationship with pepsico pepsico is considered a related party due to the nature of our franchise relationship and its ownership interest in our company 
more than percent of our volume is derived from the sale of brands from pepsico 
at december   pepsico owned approximately percent of our outstanding common stock and percent of our outstanding class b common stock  together representing approximately percent of the voting power of all classes of our voting stock 
in addition  at december   pepsico owned percent of the equity of bottling llc 
we fully consolidate the results of bottling llc and present pepsico s share as minority interest in our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents our business is conducted primarily under beverage agreements with pepsico  including a master bottling agreement  a non cola bottling agreement and a master syrup agreement 
these agreements provide pepsico with the ability  at its sole discretion  to establish prices  and other terms and conditions for our purchase of concentrates and finished product from pepsico 
additionally  under a shared services agreement  we obtain various services from pepsico  which include services for information technology maintenance and the procurement of raw materials 
we also provide services to pepsico  including facility and credit and collection support 
because we depend on pepsico to provide us with concentrate  bottler incentives and various services  changes in our relationship with pepsico could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results 
for further information about our relationship with pepsico and its affiliates see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements

overall  we increased our worldwide revenue by seven percent and our gross profit improved by five percent 
worldwide operating income was down less than one percent as a result of the six percentage point negative impact from the adoption of sfas r

this growth was fueled by strong execution and strategic marketing programs that were designed to gain consumer interest 
the rd week contributed approximately one percentage point of growth 
in europe  volume grew eight percent in versus  driven by double digit increases in russia and turkey 
in russia  we had solid growth in trademark pepsi and aqua minerale  coupled with strong growth in tropicana juice drinks  lipton iced tea and local brands 
in turkey  we continued to improve our customer service through the consolidation of third party distributors and the migration of selling activities to our own employees 
these improvements and an effective advertising campaign resulted in volume increases in brand pepsi and in local brands  such as yedigun 
total volume in mexico was up five percent for the year  driven largely by growth in our water business  including an percent increase in our jug water business and a percent increase in our bottled water business 
the investments that we began making in in the marketplace and in our infrastructure in mexico have enabled us to improve both our bottled water and jug water businesses  including expansion of our home delivery system for jug water 
our csd portfolio in mexico was down about one percent primarily due to competitive pressure in the mexico city area

the increase in our effective tax rate versus the prior year is mainly due to higher earnings in the us and increased tax contingencies related to certain historic tax positions and resulting from changes in our international legal entity and debt structure 
these increases in our tax provision were partially offset by the reversal of valuation allowances and the tax deduction for qualified domestic production activities enacted pursuant to the american jobs creation act of the reversal of the valuation allowances was due in part to improved profitability trends in russia and a change to the russia tax law that enables us to use a greater amount of our russian net operating losses

market risks and cautionary statements quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks 
these risks include the risk associated with the price of commodities purchased and used in our business  interest rates on outstanding debt and currency movements impacting our non us dollar denominated assets and liabilities 
we are also subject to the risks associated with the business environment in which we operate  including the collectibility of 
table of contents accounts receivable 
we regularly assess all of these risks and have policies and procedures in place to protect against the adverse effects of these exposures 
our objective in managing our exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates is to minimize the volatility of earnings and cash flows associated with changes in the applicable rates and prices 
to achieve this objective  we have derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency 
our corporate policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information relating to our derivative instruments 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on our financial instruments 
we performed the sensitivity analyses for hypothetical changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and changes in our stock price on our unfunded deferred compensation liability 
information provided by these sensitivity analyses does not necessarily represent the actual changes in fair value that we would incur under normal market conditions because  due to practical limitations  all variables other than the specific market risk factor were held constant 
as a result  the reported changes in the values of some financial instruments that are affected by the sensitivity analyses are not matched with the offsetting changes in the values of the items that those instruments are designed to finance or hedge 
commodity price risk we are subject to market risks with respect to commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing may be limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we use future and option contracts to hedge the risk of adverse movements in commodity prices related primarily to anticipated purchases of raw materials and energy used in our operations 
with respect to commodity price risk  we currently have various contracts outstanding for commodity purchases in  which establish our purchase prices within defined ranges 
we estimate that a percent decrease in commodity prices with all other variables held constant would have resulted in a decrease in the fair value of our financial instruments of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
interest rate risk interest rate risk is present with both fixed and floating rate debt 
we use interest rate swaps to manage our interest expense risk 
these instruments effectively change the interest rate of specific debt issuances 
as a result  changes in interest rates on our variable debt would change our interest expense 
we estimate that a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt and cash equivalents with all other variables held constant would have resulted in an increase to net interest expense of million and million in and  respectively 
we also enter into treasury rate lock agreements to hedge against adverse interest rate changes on certain debt financing arrangements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk in  approximately percent of our net revenues came from outside the united states 
social  economic and political conditions in these international markets may adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows and financial condition 
the overall risks to our international businesses include changes in foreign governmental policies and other political or economic developments 
these developments may lead to new product pricing  tax or other policies and monetary fluctuations that may adversely impact our business 
in addition  our results of operations and the value of the foreign assets and liabilities are affected by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the statements of operations of our businesses outside the us into us dollars affects year over year comparability 
we generally have not hedged against these types of currency risks because cash flows from our international operations are usually reinvested locally 
we have foreign currency transactional risks in certain of our international territories for transactions that are denominated in currencies that are different from their functional currency 
we have entered into forward exchange 
table of contents contracts to hedge portions of our forecasted us dollar cash flows in our canadian business 
a percent weaker us dollar against the canadian dollar  with all other variables held constant  would result in a decrease in the fair value of these contracts of million and million at december  and december   respectively 
foreign currency gains and losses reflect both transaction gains and losses in our foreign operations  as well as translation gains and losses arising from the re measurement into us dollars of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary countries 
beginning in  turkey was no longer considered highly inflationary  and changed its functional currency from the us dollar to the turkish lira 
unfunded deferred compensation liability our unfunded deferred compensation liability is subject to changes in our stock price  as well as price changes in certain other equity and fixed income investments 
employee investment elections include pbg stock and a variety of other equity and fixed income investment options 
since the plan is unfunded  employees deferred compensation amounts are not directly invested in these investment vehicles 
instead  we track the performance of each employee s investment selections and adjust his or her deferred compensation account accordingly 
the adjustments to the employees accounts increases or decreases the deferred compensation liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting increase or decrease to our selling  delivery and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we use prepaid forward contracts to hedge the portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on our stock price 
therefore  changes in compensation expense as a result of changes in our stock price are substantially offset by the changes in the fair value of these contracts 
we estimate that a percent unfavorable change in the year end stock price would have reduced the fair value from these forward contract commitments by million in and

we offer certain sales incentives on a local and national level 
table of contents through various customer trade agreements designed to enhance the growth of our revenue 
customer trade agreements are accounted for as a reduction to our revenues 
customer trade agreements with our customers include payments for in store displays  volume rebates  featured advertising and other growth incentives 
a number of our customer trade agreements are based on quarterly and annual targets that generally do not exceed one year 
amounts recognized in our financial statements are based on amounts estimated to be paid to our customers depending upon current performance  historical experience  forecasted volume and other performance criteria 
advertising and marketing costs we are involved in a variety of programs to promote our products 
we include advertising and marketing costs in selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
advertising and marketing costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively  before bottler incentives received from pepsico and other brand owners 
bottler incentives pepsico and other brand owners  at their discretion  provide us with various forms of bottler incentives 
these incentives cover a variety of initiatives  including direct marketplace support and advertising support 
we classify bottler incentives as follows direct marketplace support represents pepsico s and other brand owners agreed upon funding to assist us in offering sales and promotional discounts to retailers and is generally recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales 
if the direct marketplace support is a reimbursement for a specific  incremental and identifiable program  the funding is recorded as an offset to the cost of the program 
advertising support represents agreed upon funding to assist us for the cost of media time and promotional materials and is generally recorded as an adjustment to cost of sales 
advertising support that represents reimbursement for a specific  incremental and identifiable media cost  is recorded as a reduction to advertising and marketing expenses within selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
total bottler incentives recognized as adjustments to net revenues  cost of sales and selling  delivery and administrative expenses in our consolidated statements of operations were as follows fiscal year ended net revenues cost of sales selling  delivery and administrative expenses total bottler incentives share based compensation effective january   the company adopted the fair value based method of accounting prescribed in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

shipping and handling costs our shipping and handling costs reported in the consolidated statements of operations are recorded primarily within selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
such costs recorded within selling  delivery and administrative expenses totaled billion  billion and billion in  and  respectively 
foreign currency gains and losses we translate the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date  while we translate the statements of operations at the average rates of exchange during the year 
the resulting translation adjustments of our foreign subsidiaries are recorded directly to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
foreign currency gains and losses reflect both transaction gains and losses in our foreign operations  as well as translation gains and losses arising from the re measurement into us dollars of the net monetary assets of businesses in highly inflationary countries 
beginning january   turkey was no longer considered to be a highly inflationary economy for accounting purposes 

table of contents pension and postretirement medical benefit plans we sponsor pension and other postretirement medical benefit plans in various forms both in the us and similar plans outside the us  covering employees who meet specified eligibility requirements 
we account for our defined benefit pension plans and our postretirement medical benefit plans using actuarial models required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans sfas 
effective for our fiscal year ending  we recognized on our balance sheet the funded status of each of the pension and other postretirement medical plans we sponsor in the united states and other similar plans we sponsor outside the united states 
the assets  liabilities and expense associated with our international plans were not significant to our results of operations  and accordingly assumptions regarding these plans are not included in the discussion below 
the assets  liabilities and assumptions used to measure pension and postretirement medical expense for any fiscal year are determined as of september of the preceding year measurement date 
the discount rate assumption used in our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans accounting is based on current interest rates for high quality  long term corporate debt as determined on each measurement date 
in evaluating the expected rate of return on assets for a given fiscal year  we consider the actual to year historic returns on asset classes in our pension investment portfolio  reflecting the weighted average return of our asset allocation and use them as a guide for future returns 
differences between actual and expected returns are generally recognized in the net periodic pension calculation over five years 
to the extent the amount of all unrecognized gains and losses exceeds percent of the larger of the pension benefit obligation or plan assets  such amount is amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants 
we amortize prior service costs on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits 
income taxes our effective tax rate is based on pre tax income  statutory tax rates  tax regulations and tax planning strategies available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the tax bases of our assets and liabilities reflect our best estimate of the tax benefit and costs we expect to realize 
we establish valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that will more likely than not be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax position 
we establish tax reserves when  based on the applicable tax law and facts and circumstances relating to a particular transaction or tax position  it becomes probable that the position will not be sustained when challenged by a taxing authority 
a change in our tax reserves could have a significant impact on our results of operations 
earnings per share we compute basic earnings per share by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the period 
diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised and converted into common stock that would then participate in net income 
cash equivalents cash equivalents represent funds we have temporarily invested with original maturities not exceeding three months 
allowance for doubtful accounts a portion of our accounts receivable will not be collected due to non payment  bankruptcies and sales returns 
our accounting policy for the provision for doubtful accounts requires reserving an amount based on the evaluation of the aging of accounts receivable  sales return trend analysis  detailed analysis of high risk customers accounts  and the overall market and economic conditions of our customers 
inventories we value our inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
the cost of our inventory is generally computed on the first in  first out method 

table of contents property  plant and equipment we state property  plant and equipment pp e at cost  except for pp e that has been impaired  for which we write down the carrying amount to estimated fair market value  which then becomes the new cost basis 
goodwill and other intangible assets  net goodwill consists of the excess cost of acquired enterprises over the sum of the amounts assigned to assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
the company completed the annual impairment test for in the fiscal fourth quarter and no impairment was determined 
other intangible assets that are subject to amortization are amortized on a straight line basis over the period in which we expect to receive economic benefit and are reviewed for impairment when facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the determination of the expected life will be dependent upon the use and underlying characteristics of the intangible asset 
in our evaluation of these intangible assets  we consider the nature and terms of the underlying agreements  competitive environment  and brand history  as applicable 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  impairment is measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair value is generally estimated based on either appraised value or other valuation techniques 
casualty insurance costs in the united states  we use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms  including a wholly owned captive insurance entity  which participates in a reinsurance pool  to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation  product and general risk liability and automobile risks 
we are self insured or have large deductible programs for workers compensation and automobile risks for occurrences up to million  and product and general liability risks for occurrences up to million 
for losses exceeding these self insurance thresholds  we purchase casualty insurance from a third party provider 
our liability for casualty costs was million as of december  of which million was reported in accounts payable and other current liabilities and million was recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
at december   our liability for casualty costs was million of which million was reported in accounts payable and other current liabilities and million was recorded in other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
our liability for casualty costs is estimated using individual case based valuations and statistical analyses and is based upon historical experience  actuarial assumptions and professional judgment 
we do not discount our loss expense reserves 
minority interest pbg and pepsico contributed bottling businesses and assets used in the bottling businesses to bottling llc in connection with the formation of bottling llc in february at december   pbg owned percent of bottling llc and pepsico owned the remaining percent 
accordingly  minority interest in the consolidated financial statements primarily reflects pepsico s share of the consolidated net income of bottling llc as minority interest in our consolidated statements of operations  and pepsico s share of consolidated net assets of bottling llc as minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets 
treasury stock we record the repurchase of shares of our common stock at cost and classify these shares as treasury stock within shareholders equity 
repurchased shares are included in our authorized and issued shares but not included in our shares outstanding 
we record shares reissued using an average cost 
at december  we had million shares authorized under our share repurchase program 
since the inception of our share repurchase program in october  we have repurchased approximately million shares and have reissued approximately million for stock option exercises 
financial instruments and risk management we use derivative instruments to hedge against the risk of adverse movements associated with commodity prices  interest rates and foreign currency 
our corporate policy prohibits the use of derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  and we have procedures in place to monitor and control their use 
all derivative instruments are recorded at fair value as either assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
derivative instruments are generally designated and accounted for as either a hedge of a recognized asset or 
table of contents liability fair value hedge or a hedge of a forecasted transaction cash flow hedge 
the derivative s gain or loss recognized in earnings is recorded consistent with the expense classification of the underlying hedged item 
if a fair value or cash flow hedge were to cease to qualify for hedge accounting or were terminated  it would continue to be carried on the balance sheet at fair value until settled  but hedge accounting would be discontinued prospectively 
if the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist  any associated amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss are reclassified to earnings at that time 
we also may enter into a derivative instrument for which hedge accounting is not required because it is entered into to offset changes in the fair value of an underlying transaction recognized in earnings natural hedge 
these instruments are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings 
commitments and contingencies we are subject to various claims and contingencies related to lawsuits  taxes  environmental and other matters arising out of the normal course of business 
liabilities related to commitments and contingencies are recognized when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
new accounting standards sfas no

for the years ended december   december  and december   options to purchase million shares  million shares  and million shares  respectively are not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the option exercise prices were greater than the average market price of the company s common shares during the related periods and the effect of including the options in the computation would be antidilutive 
note share based compensation accounting for share based compensation effective january   the company adopted sfas r 
among its provisions  sfas r requires the company to recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on their grant date fair value 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company utilized the intrinsic value based method of accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations  and adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas 
under the intrinsic value based method of accounting  compensation expense for stock options granted to the company s employees was measured as the excess of the quoted market price of common stock at the grant date over the amount the employee must pay for the stock 
the company s policy is to grant stock options at fair value on the date of grant and as a result  no compensation expense was historically recognized for stock options 
the company adopted sfas r in the first quarter of using the modified prospective approach 
under this transition method  the measurement and our method of amortization of costs for share based payments granted prior to  but not vested as of january   would be based on the same estimate of the grant date fair value and the same amortization method that was previously used in our sfas pro forma disclosure 
results for prior periods have not been restated as provided for under the modified prospective approach 
for equity awards granted after the date of adoption  we amortize share based compensation expense on a straight line basis over the vesting term 

table of contents compensation expense is recognized only for share based payments expected to vest 
we estimate forfeitures  both at the date of grant as well as throughout the vesting period  based on the company s historical experience and future expectations 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the effect of forfeitures on the pro forma expense amounts was recognized based on estimated forfeitures 
the adoption of sfas r reduced our basic earnings per share by and diluted earnings per share by for the year ended total share based compensation expense recognized in selling  delivery and administrative expenses in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended was million  which is before an income tax benefit of million and minority interest of million  resulting in a decrease to net income of million

additionally  we granted restricted stock units to certain senior executives 
non employee members of our board of directors directors participate in a separate incentive plan and receive non qualified stock options or restricted stock units 
beginning in  we granted a mix of stock options and restricted stock units to middle and senior management employees and directors under our incentive plans 
shares available for future issuance to employees and directors under existing plans were million at december  the fair value of pbg stock options was estimated at the date of grant using the black scholes merton option valuation model 
the table below outlines the weighted average assumptions for options granted during years ended december   december  and december  risk free interest rate expected term in years expected volatility expected dividend yield 
table of contents the risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with an equivalent remaining expected term 
the expected term of the options represents the estimated period of time employees will retain their vested stocks until exercise and is based on historical experience of similar awards  giving consideration to the contractual terms  vesting schedules and expectations of future employee behavior 
expected stock price volatility is based on a combination of historical volatility of the company s stock and the implied volatility of its traded options 
the expected dividend yield is management s long term estimate of annual dividends to be paid as a percentage of share price 
the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of pbg stock on the date of grant 
we receive a tax deduction for certain stock option exercises when the options are exercised  generally for the excess of the stock price when the options are exercised over the exercise price of the options 
additionally  we receive a tax deduction for restricted stock units equal to the fair market value of pbg s stock at the date of conversion to pbg stock 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company presented all tax benefits resulting from equity awards as operating cash inflows in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
sfas r requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of the grant date fair value for these equity awards to be classified as financing cash inflows rather than operating cash inflows  on a prospective basis 
for the year ended december   we recognized million in tax benefits from the exercise of equity awards  of which million was recorded as excess tax benefits in the consolidated statements of cash flows  resulting in a decrease of cash from operations and an increase in cash from financing of million 
as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested share based compensation arrangements granted under the incentive plans 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years

in previous years  we have entered into additional treasury rate lock agreements to hedge against adverse interest rate 
table of contents changes on certain debt financing arrangements 
these agreements qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
for a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the change in the fair value of a derivative instrument is deferred in aocl until the underlying hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a fair value change on a qualifying cash flow hedge is recognized in earnings immediately and is recorded consistent with the expense classification of the underlying hedged item

the ineffective portion of the change in fair value of these contracts was not material to our results of operations in  or fair value hedges we finance a portion of our operations through fixed rate debt instruments 
we effectively converted million of our senior notes to floating rate debt through the use of interest rate swaps with the objective of reducing our overall borrowing costs 
these interest rate swaps meet the criteria for fair value hedge accounting and are percent effective in eliminating the market rate risk inherent in our long term debt 
accordingly  any gain or loss associated with these swaps is fully offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
during  the fair value of the interest rate swap liability decreased from million at december  to million at december  in  the fair value change of our swaps and debt was recorded in other liabilities and long term debt in our consolidated balance sheets

as part of the deferral process  employees select from phantom investment options that determine the earnings on the deferred compensation liability and the amount that they will ultimately receive 
employee investment elections include pbg stock and a variety of other equity and fixed income investment options 

table of contents since the plan is unfunded  employees deferred compensation amounts are not directly invested in these investment vehicles 
instead  we track the performance of each employee s investment selections and adjust his or her deferred compensation account accordingly 
the adjustments to the employees accounts increases or decreases the deferred compensation liability reflected on our consolidated balance sheets with an offsetting increase or decrease to our selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
we use prepaid forward contracts to hedge the portion of our deferred compensation liability that is based on our stock price

we recognized million in income in and million in income in  resulting from the change in fair value of these prepaid forward contracts 
the earnings impact from these instruments is classified as selling  delivery and administrative expenses 
other financial assets and liabilities financial assets with carrying values approximating fair value include cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable
