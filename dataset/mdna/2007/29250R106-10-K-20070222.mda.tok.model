item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition in our natural gas segment included in the future prospects section entitled other matters of this report for more information about calpine s bankruptcy filling 
our kpc system has of its capacity reserved under firm transportation contracts extending through and an additional of its capacity reserved under contracts extending through the kpc system s primary customers are local distribution companies 
our long term financial condition depends on the continued availability of natural gas for transportation to the markets served by our systems 
existing customers may not extend their contracts if the availability of natural gas from the mid continent and gulf coast producing regions was to decline and if the cost of transporting natural gas from other producing regions through other pipelines into the areas we serve were to render the delivered cost of natural gas uneconomical 
we may be unable to find additional customers to replace the lost demand or transportation fees 
competition 
competition from other pipeline companies is significant in all the markets we serve 
competitors of our gathering  treating and processing systems include interstate and intrastate pipelines or their affiliates and other midstream businesses that gather  treat  process and market natural gas or ngls 
some of these competitors are substantially larger than we are 
competition for the services we provide varies based upon the location of gathering  treating and processing facilities 
most natural gas producers and owners have alternate gathering  treating and processing facilities available to them 
in addition  they have alternatives such as building their own gathering facilities or in some cases  selling their natural gas supplies without treating and processing 
in addition to location  competition also varies based upon pricing arrangements and reputation 
on the sour gas systems  such as our east texas system  competition is more limited due to the infrastructure required to treat sour gas 
competition for customers in the marketing of residue gas is based primarily upon the price of the delivered gas  the services offered by the seller and the reliability of the seller in making deliveries 
residue gas also competes on a price basis with alternative fuels such as crude oil and coal  especially for customers that have the capability of using these alternative fuels  and on the basis of local environmental considerations 
competition in the marketing of ngls comes from other ngl marketing companies  producers  traders  chemical companies and other asset owners 
because pipelines are generally the only practical mode of transportation for natural gas over land  the most significant competitors of our natural gas pipelines are other pipelines 
pipelines typically compete with each other based on location  capacity  price and reliability 
many of the large wholesale customers we serve have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities 
accordingly  many of these customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines or third parties that may hold capacity on the various pipelines 
in addition  a number of new interstate natural gas pipelines are being constructed in areas currently served by some of our intrastate and interstate pipelines 
when completed  these new pipelines may compete for customers with our existing pipelines 
trucking and liquids marketing operations we also include our trucking and liquids marketing operations in our natural gas segment 
trucking and liquids marketing operations include the transportation of ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide by truck and railcar from wellheads and treating  processing and fractionation facilities and to wholesale customers  such as distributors  refiners and chemical facilities 
in addition  our trucking and liquids marketing operations resell these products 
a key component of our business is ensuring market access for the liquids extracted at our processing facilities 
on average this accounts for approximately of the volume transported by our trucking and liquids marketing business and is a major source of its growth in this area 
our services are provided using trucks  trailers and rail cars  product treating and handling equipment and ngl storage facilities 
in addition  our co plant  with tons per day of capacity  takes excess co from hydrogen producers which we then sell to a variety of customers 
at the end of  we took ownership of an underground propane storage facility in petal  mississippi  which augments the services we provide to our customers in the region 
the total capacity of this facility is million bbls which increases our storage capabilities 
in late  we began increasing our truck fleet by approximately percent to meet the growing supply of ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide from our processing facilities  as well as to capitalize on the opportunity to better serve our gulf coast customers 
customers 
most of the customers of our trucking and liquids marketing operations are wholesale customers  such as refineries and propane distributors 
our trucking and liquids marketing operations also market products to wholesale customers such as petrochemical plants 
supply and demand 
the areas served by our trucking and liquids marketing operations are geographically diverse  and the forces that affect the supply of the products transported vary by region 
crude oil and natural gas prices and production levels affect the supply of these products 
the demand for services is affected by the demand for ngls and crude oil by large industrial refineries  and similar customers in the regions served by this business 
competition 
our trucking and liquids marketing operations have a number of competitors  including other trucking and railcar operations  pipelines  and  to a lesser extent  marine transportation and alternative fuels 
in addition  the marketing activities of our trucking and liquids marketing operations have numerous competitors  including marketers of all types and sizes  affiliates of pipelines and independent aggregators 
marketing segment our marketing segment s primary objective is to maximize the value of the gas purchased by our gathering systems and the throughput on our gathering and intrastate wholesale customer pipelines 
to achieve this objective  our marketing segment transacts with various counterparties to provide natural gas supply  transportation  balancing  storage and sales services 
since our gathering and intrastate wholesale customer pipeline assets are geographically located within texas  oklahoma  alabama and louisiana  the majority of activities conducted by our marketing segment are focused within these areas 
customers 
natural gas purchased and sold by our marketing segment is sold to industrial  utility and power plant end use customers 
in addition  gas is sold to marketing companies at various market hubs 
these sales are typically priced based upon a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to end use customers incorporate a pass through charge for costs of transportation and additional margin to compensate us for associated services 
supply and demand 
supply for our marketing business depends to a large extent on the natural gas reserves and rate of drilling within the areas served by our natural gas segment 
demand is typically driven by weather related factors with respect to power plant and utility customers  and industrial demand 
our marketing business uses third party storage capacity to balance supply and demand factors within its portfolio 
marketing pays third party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store gas for various periods of time 
these contracts may be denoted as firm storage  interruptible storage  or parking and lending services 
these various contract structures are used to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts  and to take advantage of price differential opportunities 
due to the increased volumes from our gathering assets  our marketing business leases third party pipeline capacity downstream from our natural gas assets under firm transportation contracts following specific  controlled guidelines 
this capacity is leased for various lengths of time and rates that allows our marketing business to diversify its customer base by expanding its service territory 
additionally  this transportation capacity provides assurance that our gas will not be shut in due to capacity constraints on downstream pipelines 
competition 
our marketing segment has numerous competitors  including large natural gas marketing companies  marketing affiliates of pipelines  major oil and gas producers  independent aggregators and regional marketing companies 
regulation regulation by the ferc of interstate common carrier liquids pipelines the lakehead  north dakota  and ozark systems are our primary interstate common carrier liquids pipelines subject to regulation by the ferc under the ica 
as common carriers in interstate commerce  these pipelines provide service to any shipper who requests transportation services  provided that products tendered for transportation satisfy the conditions and specifications contained in the applicable tariff 
the ica generally requires us to maintain tariffs on file with the ferc that set forth the rates we charge for providing transportation services on our interstate common carrier pipelines  as well as the rules and regulations governing these services 
the ica gives the ferc the authority to regulate the rates we charge for service on our interstate common carrier pipelines 
the ica requires  among other things  that such rates be just and reasonable and nondiscriminatory 
the ica permits interested persons to challenge newly proposed or changed rates and authorizes the ferc to suspend the effectiveness of such rates for a period of up to seven months and to investigate the rates to determine if they are just and reasonable 
if  upon completion of an investigation  the ferc finds that the new or changed rate is unlawful  it is authorized to require the carrier to refund with interest the increased revenues in excess of the amount that would have been collected during the term of the investigation at the rate properly determined to be lawful 
the ferc also may investigate  upon complaint  or on its own motion  rates that are already in effect and may order a carrier to change its rates prospectively 
upon an appropriate showing  a shipper may obtain reparations for damages sustained for a period of up to two years prior to the filing of a complaint 
on october   congress passed the energy policy act of  or ep act  which deemed petroleum pipeline rates that were in effect for the day period ending on the date of enactment  or that were in effect on the th day preceding enactment and had not been subject to complaint  protest or investigation during the day period  to be just and reasonable under the ica ie  grandfathered 
the ep act also limited the circumstances under which a complaint can be made against such grandfathered rates 
in order to challenge grandfathered rates  a party must show  that it was contractually barred from challenging the rates during the relevant day period  that there has been a substantial change after the date of enactment of the ep act in the economic circumstances of the pipeline or in the nature of the services that were the basis for the rate  or that the rate is unduly discriminatory or unduly preferential 
the ferc has determined that the lakehead system rates are not covered by the grandfathering provisions of the ep act because they were subject to challenge prior to the effective date of the statute 
we believe that the rates for the north dakota and ozark systems should be found to be largely covered by the grandfathering provisions of the ep act 
the ep act required the ferc to issue rules establishing a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for petroleum pipelines  and to streamline procedures in petroleum pipeline proceedings 
the ferc responded to this mandate by issuing order no 
 which  among other things  adopted an indexing rate methodology for petroleum pipelines 
under the regulations  which became effective january   petroleum pipelines are able to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to an inflation index 
rate increases made within the ceiling levels may be protested  but such protests must show that the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline s increase in costs 
if the indexing methodology results in a reduced ceiling level that is lower than a pipeline s filed rate  order no 
requires the pipeline to reduce its rate to comply with the lower ceiling  although a pipeline is not required to reduce its rate below the level grandfathered under the ep act 
under order no 
 a pipeline must  as a general rule  utilize the indexing methodology to change its rates 
the ferc  however  uses cost of service ratemaking  market based rates and settlement rates as alternatives to the indexing approach in certain specified circumstances 
under order no 
 the original inflation index adopted by the ferc was equal to the annual change in the ppi fg minus one percentage point 
the index was subject to review every five years 
rates were then subject to an annual adjustment  based upon changes in the ppi fg minus  in order to accurately reflect the actual cost changes experienced by the oil pipeline industry 
in december  as part of the ferc s five year review of the oil pricing index july through june  the ferc concluded that the ppi fg accurately reflected the actual cost changes experienced by the industry 
in february the ferc issued an order on remand concluding that for the current five year period  the oil pricing index should be the ppi fg 
in order to calculate the ceiling rate levels  oil pipelines were permitted to use the ppi fg adjustment as though it had been in effect since as of july  the index increased to equal ppi fg plus percentage points  resulting in an index of 
the ferc attributed the higher index formula to increases in industry costs from the imposition of new safety and environmental regulatory obligations  voluntary security measures  and higher energy costs 
the ferc will continue  over the next five years  to review the oil pipeline index and monitor whether the current rate in place still reflects the actual cost changes experienced by the oil pipeline industry 
allowance for income taxes in rates in a decision involving our lakehead system  which we refer to as the lakehead ruling  the ferc partially disallowed the inclusion of income taxes in the cost of service for the lakehead system 
a subsequent appeal of the lakehead ruling was resolved by settlement and therefore was not adjudicated 
in another ferc proceeding involving sfpp  the ferc initially relied on its previous lakehead ruling to hold that sfpp could not claim an income tax allowance for income attributable to non corporate partners  both individuals and other entities 
sfpp and other parties to the proceeding appealed the ferc s orders to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit  or the dc circuit court 
on july   in bp west coast products llc v 
ferc no 
 which we refer to as the bp west coast decision  the dc circuit court issued a decision upholding certain aspects of the ferc s orders regarding the sfpp case  but vacating the ferc s ruling regarding the proper tax allowance for sfpp 
the dc circuit court rejected the ferc s rationale for its lakehead ruling and remanded the case to the ferc for further proceedings 
in the wake of the bp west coast decision  the ferc initiated a notice and comment process to address tax allowance issues across a range of industries 
we and many other companies commented on the proceeding 
on may   the ferc issued a policy statement on income tax allowances  in which it reinstated its earlier policy of providing a full tax allowance on all partnership and similar legal interests in regulated companies if the owner of that interest has an actual or potential tax liability on the income earned through that interest 
whether a pipeline s owners have such actual or potential income tax liability will be reviewed by the ferc on a case by case basis 
on december   ferc issued its first case specific oil pipeline review of the income tax allowance issue in the sfpp proceeding  reaffirming its new income tax allowance policy and directing sfpp to provide certain evidence necessary for the pipeline to determine its income tax allowance 
the new tax allowance policy and the december order have been appealed to the dc circuit court  and rehearing requests have been filed with respect to the december order 
as well as the sfpp decision  which is currently on appeal  there are two other cases with regards to tax allowance pending in the dc circuit court including exxon mobil oil corporation v 
ferc and capp v 
ferc 
the dc circuit court heard oral arguments on these cases on december  a decision is expected by april at this time  the ultimate outcome of these proceedings is not certain and could result in changes to the ferc s treatment of income tax allowances in cost of service arrangements 
whether the income tax allowance policy is ultimately upheld or modified on judicial review  could affect the tariffs of ferc regulated pipelines 
a related issue is whether the ferc s income tax allowance policy can be relied upon by shippers as a substantial change in circumstances sufficient to remove the grandfathering protection under the ep act from an oil pipeline s rates 
the ferc determined in the sfpp case that its policy statement on income tax allowances does not represent a change from its pre ep act policy and therefore  cannot affect grandfathering of rates  a position that is still potentially subject to further judicial review 
at this time  the effect of the ferc s policy statement on income tax allowances on us is uncertain 
the tariff rates on our common carrier interstate liquids pipelines have been established under a variety of different circumstances including settlements and tariff indexing 
it is anticipated that a change in the income tax allowance policy would only impact those rates that were established after indexing 
even with the indexed rates  the income tax allowance is only one of many elements supporting our pipeline rates for service 
accordingly  we cannot predict with certainty what rates we will be allowed to charge in the future  or the potential impact on us of a change in ferc s policy statement on income tax allowances 
we believe that the rates we charge for transportation services on our interstate common carrier liquids pipelines are just and reasonable under the ica 
however  because the rates that we charge are subject to review upon an appropriately supported protest or complaint  we cannot predict what rates we will be allowed to charge in the future for service on our interstate common carrier liquids pipelines 
furthermore  because rates charged for transportation services must be competitive with those charged by other transporters  the rates set forth in our tariffs will be determined based on competitive factors in addition to regulatory considerations 
accounting for pipeline assessment costs in june  the ferc issued an order in docket ai describing how ferc regulated companies should account for costs associated with implementing the pipeline integrity management requirements of the united states department of transportation s office of pipeline safety 
the order took effect on january  under the order  ferc regulated companies are generally required to recognize costs incurred in performing pipeline assessments that are part of a pipeline integrity management program as maintenance expense in the period in which the costs are incurred 
costs for items such as rehabilitation projects designed to extend the useful life of the system can continue to be capitalized to the extent permitted under the existing rules 
the ferc denied rehearing of its accounting guidance order on september  we have historically capitalized first time in line inspection programs  based on previous rulings by the ferc 
in january  we began expensing all first time internal inspection costs for all our pipeline systems  whether or not they are subject to ferc regulation on a prospective basis 
we will continue to expense secondary internal inspection tests consistent with our previous practice 
refer to note summary of significant accounting policies included in our consolidated financial statements beginning at page f of this annual report on form k 
regulation by the ferc of interstate natural gas pipelines our alatenn  midla  kpc and utos systems are interstate natural gas pipelines regulated by the ferc under the nga  and the ngpa 
each system operates under separate ferc approved tariffs that establish rates  terms and conditions under which each system provides service to its customers 
in addition  the ferc s authority over natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce includes certification and construction of new facilities  extension or abandonment of services and facilities  maintenance of accounts and records  acquisition and disposition of facilities  initiation and discontinuation of services  conduct and relationship with energy affiliates  and various other matters 
tariff changes can only be implemented upon approval by the ferc 
two primary methods are available for changing the rates  terms and conditions of service of an interstate natural gas pipeline 
under the first method  the pipeline voluntarily seeks a tariff change by making a tariff filing with the ferc justifying the proposed tariff change and providing notice  generally days  to the appropriate parties 
if the ferc determines that a proposed change is just and reasonable as required by the nga  the ferc will accept the proposed change and the pipeline will implement such change in its tariff 
however  if the ferc determines that a proposed change may not be just and reasonable as required by the nga  then the ferc may suspend such change for up to five months and set the matter for an administrative hearing 
subsequent to any suspension period ordered by the ferc  the proposed change may be placed into effect by the company  pending final ferc approval 
in most cases  a proposed rate increase is placed into effect before a final ferc determination on such rate increase  and the proposed increase is collected subject to refund plus interest 
under the second method  the ferc may  on its own motion or based on a complaint  initiate a proceeding seeking to compel the company to change its rates  terms and or conditions of service 
if the ferc determines that the existing rates  terms and or conditions of service are unjust  unreasonable  unduly discriminatory or preferential  then any rate reduction or change that it orders generally will be effective prospectively from the date of the ferc order requiring this change 
in november  the ferc issued order governing the standards of conduct for transmission providers including natural gas interstate pipelines 
these standards provide that interstate pipeline employees engaged in natural gas transmission system operations must function independently from any employees of their energy affiliates and marketing affiliates and that an interstate pipeline must treat all transmission customers  affiliated and non affiliated  on a non discriminatory basis  and cannot operate its transmission system to benefit preferentially  an energy or marketing affiliate 
in addition  order restricts access to natural gas transmission customer data by marketing and other energy affiliates and provides certain conditions on service provided by interstate pipelines to their gas marketing and energy affiliates 
we have implemented changes in business processes to comply with this order 
in november  the dc circuit court vacated order as that order applies to interstate natural gas pipelines and remanded that proceeding to the ferc for further action 
on january   the ferc issued order in response to the d 
c 
circuit court s decision 
in its order  the commission issued new interim standards of conduct pending the outcome of a new rulemaking proceeding 
the interim standards will only govern the relationship between an interstate pipeline and its marketing affiliates as opposed to its energy affiliates  the latter being a much broader category as originally set forth in order as a result  the commission effectively repromulgated on a temporary basis the standards of conduct first issued in order in  while it considers its course of action to address the court s decision on a more permanent basis 
on january   the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr in docket no 
rm wherein it proposes to make permanent its interim standards of conduct issued in order the commission is also seeking comment as to whether it should make comparable changes to the electric industry standards of conduct that were not affected by either the november decision by the dc circuit court  or by order  as well as comments regarding certain other electric related exceptions to order we continue to closely monitor these proceedings and administer our compliance programs accordingly 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before congress  the ferc and the courts 
the natural gas industry historically has been heavily regulated  therefore  there is no assurance that a more stringent regulatory approach will not be pursued by the ferc and congress  especially in light of market power abuse by marketing affiliates of certain pipeline companies engaged in interstate commerce 
in response to this issue  congress  in the energy policy act of epact  and the ferc have implemented requirements to ensure that energy prices are not impacted by the exercise of market power or manipulative conduct 
epact prohibits the use of any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas  electric energy or transportation subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
the ferc then adopted the market manipulation rules and the market behavior rules to implement the authority granted under epact 
these rules  which prohibit fraud and manipulation in wholesale energy markets  are very vague and are subject to broad interpretation 
although the ferc has not issued any order interpreting these rules  it is likely that the ferc will give itself broad latitude in determining whether specific behavior violates the rules 
in addition  epact gave the ferc increased penalty authority for these violations 
the ferc may now issue civil penalties of up to million per day for each violation of ferc rules  and there are possible criminal penalties of up to million and years in prison 
given the ferc s broad mandate granted in epact  it is assumed that if energy prices are high  the ferc will investigate energy markets to determine if behavior unduly impacted or manipulated energy prices 
intrastate pipeline regulation our intrastate liquids and natural gas pipeline operations generally are not subject to rate regulation by the ferc  but they are subject to regulation by various agencies of the states in which they are located 
however  to the extent that our intrastate pipeline systems deliver natural gas into interstate commerce  the rates  terms and conditions of such transportation service are subject to ferc jurisdiction under section of the ngpa  which regulates  among other things  the provision of transportation services by an intrastate natural gas pipeline making deliveries on behalf of a local distribution company or an interstate natural gas pipeline 
most states have agencies that possess the authority to review and authorize natural gas transportation transactions and the construction  acquisition  abandonment and interconnection of physical facilities 
some states also have state agencies that regulate transportation rates  service terms and conditions and contract pricing to ensure their reasonableness and to ensure that the intrastate pipeline companies that they regulate do not discriminate among similarly situated customers 
natural gas gathering pipeline regulation section b of the nga exempts natural gas gathering facilities from the jurisdiction of the ferc under the nga 
we own certain natural gas pipelines that we believe meet the traditional tests the ferc has used to establish a pipeline s status as a gatherer not subject to the ferc jurisdiction 
state regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety  environmental and  in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements  but historically has not entailed rate regulation 
in  the ferc initiated an inquiry regarding the extent to which gathering both offshore and onshore systems  particularly those that have been previously transferred from a regulated entity should be regulated by the ferc 
the inquiry is still open at this time 
further  some states have  or are considering  providing greater regulatory scrutiny over the commercial regulation of natural gas gathering business 
many of the producing states have previously adopted some form of complaint based regulation that generally allows natural gas producers and shippers to file complaints with state regulators in an effort to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination 
our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services 
our gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of gathering facilities 
sales of natural gas  crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids the price at which we sell natural gas currently is not subject to federal or state regulation except for certain systems in texas 
our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability  terms and cost of pipeline transportation 
as noted above  the price and terms of access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive federal and state regulation 
the ferc is continually proposing and implementing new rules and regulations affecting those segments of the natural gas industry  most notably interstate natural gas transmission companies that remain subject to the ferc s jurisdiction 
these initiatives also may affect the intrastate transportation of natural gas under certain circumstances 
the stated purpose of many of these regulatory changes is to promote competition among the various sectors of the natural gas industry 
we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these regulatory changes to our natural gas marketing operations 
some of the ferc s more recent proposals may adversely affect the availability and reliability of interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines 
we do not believe that we will be affected by any such ferc action in a manner that is materially different than other natural gas marketers with whom we compete 
our sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids currently are not regulated and are made at market prices 
in a number of instances  however  the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates  terms and conditions of service are subject to the ferc s jurisdiction under the ica 
certain regulations implemented by the ferc in recent years could increase the cost of transportation service on certain petroleum products pipelines 
however  we do not believe that these regulations affect us any differently than other marketers of these products 
other regulation the governments of the united states and canada have  by treaty  agreed to ensure nondiscriminatory treatment for the passage of oil and natural gas through the pipelines of one country across the territory of the other 
individual border crossing points require us government permits that may be terminated or amended at the will of the us government 
these permits provide that pipelines may be inspected by or subject to orders issued by federal or state government agencies 
tariffs and rate cases lakehead system under published tariffs at december  including the tariff surcharges related to lakehead system expansions for transportation on the lakehead system  the rates for transportation of heavy crude oil from neche  north dakota  where the system enters the united states unless otherwise stated  to principal delivery points are set forth below 
published tariff per barrel to clearbrook  minnesota to superior  wisconsin to chicago  illinois area to marysville  michigan area to buffalo  new york area chicago to the international border near marysville the rates at december  for light and medium crude oils and ngl s are lower than the rates set forth in the table to compensate for differences in the costs of shipping different types and grades of liquid hydrocarbons 
we periodically adjust our tariff rates as allowed under the ferc s indexing methodology and the tariff agreements described below 
base rates the base portion of the rates for the lakehead system are subject to an annual escalation  which cannot exceed established ceiling rates as approved by the ferc  and determined in compliance with the ferc approved indexing methodology 
sep ii surcharge under the settlement agreement with capp that the ferc approved in and reconfirmed in  we implemented a tariff surcharge related to our sep ii project 
this tariff surcharge  which is added to the base rates  is a cost of service based calculation that is trued up annually usually in april for actual costs and throughputs from the previous calendar year  and is not subject to indexing 
the initial term of the sep ii portion of the settlement agreement was for years beginning in terrace surcharge under the tariff agreement approved by the ferc in  we also implemented a tariff surcharge for the terrace expansion program of approximately per barrel for light crude oil from the canadian border to chicago 
on april   pursuant to an agreement between us and enbridge pipelines  our share of the surcharge was increased to per barrel 
this surcharge was in effect until april   when our share of the surcharge changed to per barrel 
our share will remain at this level until  after which time the surcharge will return to per barrel through  the term of the agreement 
in addition to the terrace surcharge  included in the tariff is the terrace schedule c adjustment 
under the tariff agreement  when terrace phase iii facilities are in service  and annual actual average pumping exiting clearbrook are less than  m per day  an adjustment is made to the terrace surcharge 
in  this adjustment is per barrel  based on annual actual average pumpings exiting clearbrook of  m per day in facilities surcharge on july   the ferc approved a settlement with capp involving a facilities surcharge mechanism  which allows for the recovery of costs for enhancements or modifications to the system at shipper request and approved by capp 
the facilities surcharge permits the lakehead system to recover the costs associated with particular shipper requested projects through an incremental surcharge layered on top of the existing base rates and other ferc approved surcharges already in effect 
like the sep ii surcharge  the facilities surcharge is a cost of service based tariff mechanism that is trued up each year for actual costs and throughput and  therefore  is not subject to adjustment either upwards or downwards under indexing 
in  the facilities surcharge was per barrel for light movements from the us canada border near neche  north dakota to chicago 
the facilities surcharge currently includes four projects that were agreed to with capp in additional projects to be included in the facilities surcharge will be determined as the result of a negotiating process between management of the lakehead system and capp 
on march   the ferc approved the offer of settlement filed by enbridge on december   seeking approval for the southern access mainline expansion surcharge under the provisions of the previously approved facilities surcharge mechanism 
the southern access mainline expansion centers on the construction of a new inch diameter pipeline between superior  wisconsin and flanagan  illinois  along with associated upstream modifications to balance the expanded capacity created by the new superior to flanagan line 
on september   enbridge filed an offer of settlement with the ferc seeking prompt approval for the southern access extension surcharge 
the proposed extension is a new inch pipeline which connects with the southern access mainline expansion pipeline at flanagan to patoka  illinois  which allows canadian producers and shippers to access the patoka hub  where they can then access other refining centers 
under the framework that established the facilities surcharge already approved by the commission  the proposed tolling methodology in the offer of settlement asked that the costs for the extension be added to the existing base rates as a surcharge 
a variety of benefits would accrue to shippers through the extension  including a reduction in total tariff rates due to the higher utilization of upstream facilities and therefore reducing the net cost to shippers even if they do not ship on the extension itself 
the offer of settlement was opposed by three shippers and was rejected by the commission on december   which stated that enbridge did not submit adequate proof that the proposed pipeline would benefit all shippers 
enbridge still intends to continue with the development of the extension and is exploring alternative tolling methodologies that would be supported by all shippers 
mid continent system the mid continent system is comprised of pipeline  terminaling  and storage infrastructure located in the us mid continent region 
specifically the system originates in cushing  payne county  oklahoma and offers transportation service to wood river  madison county  illinois  west tulsa  oklahoma  other mid continent system facilities  local area refineries  and other interconnected pipe non affiliated infrastructure 
the rates for the transportation of light crude oil from cushing  payne county  oklahoma to principle delivery points are set forth below published tariff per barrel to wood river  illinois to west tulsa  oklahoma the rates  at december  outlined above  apply to light crude only 
medium and heavy crude oil transportation rates on these systems are higher to compensate us for differences in the costs of shipping different types and grades of liquid hydrocarbons 
where applicable  we periodically adjust our tariff rates as allowed under the ferc s indexing methodology 
currently  this methodology allows for an adjustment of rates equal to the ppi fg  which adjustment is made effective july of each year 
north dakota system our north dakota system consists of both gathering and trunkline assets 
all gathering rates from points in north dakota  montana and wyoming are per barrel  and rates for transportation of light crude oil to principle delivery points via trunklines on our north dakota system are set forth below published tariff per barrel from renville  bottinaeu  burke  ward and mountrail counties to clearbrook  minnesota from sheridan and williams county to clearbrook  minnesota from sheridan county to clearbrook  minnesota from sheridan county to clearbrook  minnesota from ramberg beaver lodge station  north dakota to clearbrook  minnesota from williams county to clearbrook  minnesota from mckenzie county to clearbrook  minnesota the rates at december   outlined above  are subject to adjustment as allowed under the indexing methodology established by the ferc 
currently this methodology allows for an adjustment of rates equal to the ppi fg  which is made effective july of each year 
north dakota expansion due to significant increases in crude oil production in the williston basin area of north dakota and montana  our north dakota system has been under significant capacity apportionment during the past year 
as a result  we submitted an offer of settlement to the ferc on august  to facilitate a two stage expansion of our north dakota system 
our offer of settlement has received wide support from current shippers on our north dakota system 
the settlement encompasses the expansion of our north dakota system mainline between minot  north dakota and clearbrook  minnesota and the feeder line between alexander and beaver lodge  north dakota 
the recovery mechanism is the implementation of two agreed upon surcharges to be added to the existing base rates of our north dakota system for a period of five years 
the proposed surcharges are transparent  cost of service based tariff mechanisms that will be trued up annually to reflect actual costs and throughput and will not be subject to index adjustments 
the expansion of our north dakota system is expected to add approximately  bpd of incremental capacity to the mainline  increasing the existing capacity to approximately  bpd between minot  north dakota and clearbrook  minnesota 
the expansion is also expected to add approximately  bpd of incremental capacity to the feeder segment of the system  increasing the existing capacity to approximately  barrels per day  between alexander and beaver lodge 
we expect the total cost of completing the mainline and feeder expansions of the north dakota systems to approximate million 
on october   the ferc approved the methodology of the proposed cost based recovery mechanism outlined in the north dakota offer of settlement on the grounds that it appears fair  reasonable and in the public interest 
natural gas systems tariff rates on the ferc regulated natural gas pipelines are approved by the ferc and vary by pipeline depending on a number of factors  including cost of providing service  throughput levels on the pipeline  and other factors 
competitive forces may prompt us to charge tariff rates below the ferc approved maximum rate on our interstate systems 
the rates charged for transmission of natural gas on pipelines not regulated by the ferc  or a state agency  are established by competitive forces 
safety regulation and environmental general our transmission and gathering pipelines and storage and processing facilities are subject to extensive federal and state environmental  operational and safety regulation 
the added costs imposed by regulations are generally no different than those imposed on our competitors 
the failure to comply with such rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties and or enforcement actions and added operational costs 
pipeline safety and transportation regulation our transmission and non rural gathering pipelines are subject to regulation by the united states department of transportation  or dot  pipeline and hazardous materials safety administration phmsa under title united states code pipeline safety act  or psa relating to the design  installation  testing  construction  operation  replacement and management of transmission and non rural gathering pipeline facilities 
the phmsa is the agency charged with regulating the safe transportation of hazardous materials under all modes of transportation  including intrastate pipelines 
periodically the psa has been reauthorized and amended  imposing new mandates on the regulator to promulgate new regulations  imposing direct mandates on operators of pipelines 
on december  the psi act of was enacted reauthorizing and amending the psa 
the most significant amendment required natural gas pipelines to develop integrity management programs and conduct integrity assessment tests at a minimum of seven year intervals 
such tests can include internal inspection  hydrostatic pressure tests or direct assessments on pipelines in certain high consequence areas 
the phmsa has since promulgated rules for this and other mandates included in the psi of on december  the pipeline inspection  protection  enforcement  and safety act of pipes of was signed into legislation that further amended the pipeline safety act 
many of the provisions were welcome  including strengthening excavation damage prevention and enforcement 
the most significant provisions of pipes of that will affect the partnership  but not materially  include a mandate to phmsa to remove most exemptions from federal regulations for liquid pipelines operating at low stress and mandates phmsa to undertake rulemaking requiring pipeline operators to have a human factors management plan for pipeline control room personnel  including consideration for controlling hours of service 
we have incorporated the new requirements of the and psa amendments into procedures and budgets and  while we expect to incur higher regulatory compliance costs  the increase is not expected to be material 
in september  phmsa proposed extending its regulatory oversight to include environmentally sensitive areas that are beyond the scope of its current jurisdiction 
phmsa currently has jurisdiction over rural gathering pipelines  low operating stress transmission pipelines that are located in high consequence areas and pipelines in urban areas or across navigable waters 
we expect this proposed rule to become final by mid and do not expect the new mandates to have a material impact on our current systems 
however  the pipes of mandated that phmsa go further and expand jurisdiction over all low stress pipelines  not just those in high consequence areas 
we expect the phmsa  therefore  to immediately issue another proposed rule for low stress pipelines  but until such rules are proposed  we are not certain of the effect or costs that the new requirements may have on our operations 
when hydrocarbons are released into the environment  the phmsa can impose a return to service plan  which can include implementing certain internal inspections  pipeline pressure reductions  and other strategies to verify the integrity of the pipeline in the affected area 
we do not anticipate any return to service plans that will have a material impact on system throughput or compliance costs  however we have the potential of incurring additional expenditures to remediate any condition in the event of a discharge or failure on the system 
our trucking and railcar operations are also subject to safety and permitting regulation by the dot and state agencies with regard to the safe transportation of hazardous and other materials 
we believe that our pipeline  trucking and railcar operations are in substantial compliance with applicable operational and safety requirements 
in instances of non compliance  we have taken actions to remediate the situations 
nevertheless  significant expenses could be incurred in the future if additional safety measures are required or if safety standards are raised and exceed the capabilities of our current pipeline control system or other safety equipment 
environmental regulation general 
our operations are subject to complex federal  state  and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of health and the environment  including laws and regulations which govern the handling  storage and release of crude oil and other liquid hydrocarbon materials or emissions from natural gas compression facilities 
as with the pipeline and processing industry in general  complying with current and anticipated environmental laws and regulations increases our overall cost of doing business  including our capital costs to construct  maintain  and upgrade equipment and facilities 
while these laws and regulations affect our maintenance capital expenditures and net income  we believe that they do not affect our competitive position since the operations of our competitors are generally similarly affected 
in addition to compliance costs  violations of environmental laws or regulations can result in the imposition of significant administrative  civil and criminal fines and penalties and  in some instances  injunctions banning or delaying certain activities 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations 
there are also risks of accidental releases into the environment associated with our operations  such as leaks or spills of crude oil  liquids or natural gas or other substances from our pipelines or storage facilities 
such accidental releases could  to the extent not insured  subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage  and fines  penalties  or damages for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
although we are entitled  in certain circumstances  to indemnification from third parties for environmental liabilities relating to assets we acquired from those parties  these contractual indemnification rights are limited and  accordingly  we may be required to bear substantial environmental expenses 
however  we believe that through our due diligence process  we identify and manage substantial issues 
air and water emissions 
our operations are subject to the federal clean air act and the federal clean water act and comparable state and local statutes 
we anticipate  therefore  that we will incur certain capital expenses in the next several years for air pollution control equipment and spill prevention measures in connection with maintaining existing facilities and obtaining permits and approvals for any new or acquired facilities 
the oil pollution act opa was enacted in and amends parts of the cwa and other statutes as they pertain to the prevention of and response to oil spills 
under the opa  we could be subject to strict  joint and potentially unlimited liability for removal costs and other consequences of an oil spill from our facilities into navigable waters  along shorelines or in an exclusive economic zone of the united states 
the opa also imposes certain spill prevention  control and countermeasure requirements for many of our non pipeline facilities  such as the preparation of detailed oil spill emergency response plans and the construction of dikes or other containment structures to prevent contamination of navigable or other waters in the event of an oil overflow  rupture or leak 
for our liquid pipeline facilities  the opa imposes requirements for emergency plans to be prepared  submitted and approved by the dot 
for our non transportation facilities  such as storage tanks that are not integral to pipeline transportation system  the opa regulations are promulgated by the epa 
we believe we are in material compliance with these laws and regulations 
hazardous substances and waste management 
the federal cercla also known as the superfund law  and similar state laws  impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct  on certain classes of persons  including the owners or operators of waste disposal sites and companies that disposed or arranged for disposal of hazardous substances found at such sites 
we may generate some wastes that fall within the definition of a hazardous substance 
we may  therefore  be jointly and severally liable under cercla for all or part of any costs required to clean up and restore sites at which such wastes have been disposed 
in addition  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances or other pollutants released into the environment 
analogous state laws may apply to a broader range of substances than cercla and  in some instances  may offer fewer exemptions from liability 
we have not received any notification that we may be potentially responsible for material cleanup costs under cercla or similar state laws 
employee health and safety 
the workplaces associated with our operations are subject to the requirements of the federal osha and comparable state statutes that regulate worker health and safety 
we have an ongoing safety  procedure and training program for our employees and believe that our operations are in compliance with applicable occupational health and safety requirements  including industry consensus standards  record keeping requirements  monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances  and hazard communication standards 
site remediation 
we own and operate a number of pipelines  gathering systems  storage facilities and processing facilities that have been used to transport  distribute  store and process crude oil  natural gas and other petroleum products 
many of our facilities were previously owned and operated by third parties whose handling  disposal and release of petroleum and waste materials were not under our control 
the age of the facilities  combined with the past operating and waste disposal practices  which were standard for the industry and regulatory regime at the time  have resulted in soil and groundwater contamination at some facilities due to historical spills and releases 
such contamination is not unusual within the natural gas and petroleum industry 
historical contamination found on  under or originating from our properties may be subject to cercla  rcra and analogous state laws as described above 
under these laws  we could incur substantial expense to remediate such contamination  including contamination caused by prior owners and operators 
in addition  enbridge management  as the entity with managerial responsibility for us  could also be liable for such costs to the extent that we are unable to fulfill our obligations 
we have conducted site investigations at some of our facilities to assess historical environmental issues  and we are currently addressing soil and groundwater contamination at various facilities through remediation and monitoring programs  with oversight by the applicable government agencies where appropriate 
in connection with our acquisition of the midcoast system from enbridge  the general partner agreed to indemnify us and other related persons for certain environmental liabilities of which the general partner had knowledge 
pursuant to the contribution agreement related to this acquisition  the general partner will not be required to indemnify us until the aggregate liabilities  including environmental liabilities  exceed million  and the general partner s aggregate liability  including environmental liabilities  may not exceed  with certain exceptions  million 
we will be liable for any environmental conditions related to the acquired systems that were not known to the general partner or were disclosed under the contribution agreement between the general partner and us 
in addition  we will be liable for all removal  remediation and disposal of all asbestos containing materials and all naturally occurring radioactive materials associated with the northeast texas system and for which the general partner is liable to the prior owner of that system 
although we believe these indemnities and conditions provide valuable protection  it is possible that the sellers from whom these assets were purchased will not be able to satisfy their indemnity obligations or their remedial obligations related to retained liabilities or properties 
in this case  it is possible that governmental agencies or third party claimants could assert that we may be liable or bear some responsibility for such obligations 
employees neither we nor enbridge management  have any employees 
our general partner has delegated to enbridge management  pursuant to a delegation of control agreement  substantially all of the responsibility for our day to day management and operation 
our general partner  however  retains certain functions and approval rights over our operations 
to fulfill its management obligations  enbridge management has entered into agreements with enbridge and several of its affiliates to provide enbridge management with the necessary services and support personnel  who act on enbridge management s behalf as its agents 
we are ultimately responsible for reimbursing these service providers based on the costs that they incur in performing these services 
insurance our operations are subject to many hazards inherent in the liquid petroleum and natural gas gathering  treating  processing and transportation industry 
we maintain insurance coverage for our operations and properties considered to be customary in the industry 
our coverage limits for property and business interruption  general liability  and polution liability insurance are expressed in canadian dollars  or cad  and vary from cad million to cad million  or us to million  for property and business interruption  general liability  and pollution liability insurance 
the exchange rate of united states dollars  or usd  for each cad represents the effective exchange rate at december  insurance policy deductibles vary with coverage and as expressed in usd range from approximately million  million  and million for property  general liability  and pollution liability  respectively 
we can make no assurance  however  that the insurance coverage we maintain will be available or adequate for any particular risk or loss  or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable 
although we believe that our assets are adequately covered by insurance  a substantial uninsured loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
taxation for us federal income tax purposes  we are not a taxable entity 
generally  federal and state income taxes on our taxable income are borne by our individual partners through the allocation of our taxable income 
such taxable income may vary substantially from net income reported in our consolidated statements of income

item a 
risk factors we encourage you to read the risk factors below in connection with the other sections of this annual report on form k 
risks related to our business our financial performance could be adversely affected if our pipeline systems are used less 
our financial performance depends to a large extent on the volumes transported on our pipeline systems 
decreases in the volumes transported by our systems  whether caused by supply or demand factors in the markets these systems serve  competition or otherwise  can directly and adversely affect our revenues and results of operations 
the volume of shipments on our lakehead system depends heavily on the supplies of western canadian crude oil 
insufficient supplies of western canadian crude oil will adversely affect our business by limiting shipments on our lakehead system 
decreases in conventional crude oil exploration and production activities in western canada and other factors including supply disruption and competition can reduce the utilization of our lakehead system 
for example  in january  deliveries on our lakehead system were impacted by a fire at a suncor facility 
the volume of crude oil that we transport on the lakehead system also depends on the demand for crude oil in the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states and the delivery by others of crude oil and refined products into these regions and the province of ontario 
pipeline capacity for the delivery of crude oil to the great lakes and midwest regions of the united states currently exceeds refining capacity 
in addition  our ability to increase deliveries to expand the lakehead system in the future depends on increased supplies of western canadian crude oil 
we expect that growth in future supplies of western canadian crude oil will come from oil sands projects in alberta  canada 
furthermore  full utilization of additional capacity as a result of our current and future expansions of the lakehead system  including the terrace expansion program  will largely depend on these anticipated increases in crude oil production from oil sands projects 
the volume of shipments on natural gas systems depends on the supply of natural gas and ngls available for shipment on those systems from the producing regions that supply these systems 
volumes shipped on these systems also are affected by the demand for natural gas and ngls in the markets these systems serve 
existing customers may not extend their contracts if the availability of natural gas from the mid continent  gulf coast and east texas producing regions was to decline or if the cost of transporting natural gas from other producing regions through other pipelines into the markets served by the natural gas systems was to render the delivered cost of natural gas on our systems uneconomical 
we may be unable to find additional customers to replace the lost demand or transportation fees 
changes in our tariff rates or challenges to our tariff rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  a recent ferc policy statement that limited allowances for income tax in an unrelated pipeline s cost of service  if applied to our ferc regulated systems  could adversely affect our rates 
the tariff rates charged by several of our existing pipeline systems are regulated by the ferc  or various state regulatory agencies 
if one of these regulatory agencies  on its own initiative or due to challenges by third parties  were to lower our tariff rates  the profitability of our pipeline businesses might suffer 
if we were permitted to raise our tariff rates for a particular pipeline  there might be significant delay between the time the tariff rate increase is approved and the time that the rate increase actually goes into effect  which delay could further reduce our cash flow 
furthermore  competition from other pipeline systems may prevent us from raising our tariff rates even if regulatory agencies permit us to do so 
the regulatory agencies that regulate our systems periodically propose and implement new rules and regulations  terms and conditions of services subject to their jurisdiction 
new initiatives or orders may adversely affect the tariff rates charged for our services 
some producing states  including oklahoma and texas  are considering legislation that would require rate and or service regulation of gathering and intrastate transmission natural gas systems 
increased state regulation could adversely impact our natural gas systems 
the question of whether and to what extent an income tax allowance should be included in a regulated utility s cost of service for rate making purposes was a matter of uncertainty for a number of years 
in a decision involving our lakehead system  which we refer to as the lakehead ruling  the ferc partially disallowed the inclusion of income taxes in the cost of service for the lakehead system 
a subsequent appeal of the lakehead ruling was resolved by settlement and therefore was not adjudicated 
in another ferc proceeding involving sfpp  the ferc initially relied on its previous lakehead ruling to hold that sfpp could not claim an income tax allowance for income attributable to non corporate partners  both individuals and other entities 
sfpp and other parties to the proceeding appealed the ferc s orders to the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit 
on july   in bp west coast products llc v 
ferc  which we refer to as the bp west coast decision  the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit issued a decision upholding certain aspects of the ferc s orders regarding the sfpp case  but vacating the ferc s ruling regarding the proper tax allowance for sfpp 
the united states court of appeals for the district of columbia rejected the ferc s rationale for its lakehead ruling and remanded the case to the ferc for further proceedings 
in the wake of the bp west coast decision  the ferc initiated a notice and comment process to address tax allowance issues across a range of industries 
we and many other companies commented on the proceeding 
on may   the ferc issued a policy statement on income tax allowances  in which it reinstated its earlier policy of providing a full tax allowance on all partnership and similar legal interests in regulated companies if the owner of that interest has an actual or potential tax liability on the income earned through that interest 
whether a pipeline s owners have such actual or potential income tax liability will be reviewed by the ferc on a case by case basis 
on december   ferc issued its first case specific oil pipeline review of the income tax allowance issue in the sfpp proceeding  reaffirming its new income tax allowance policy and directing sfpp to provide certain evidence necessary for the pipeline to determine its income tax allowance 
the new tax allowance policy and the december order have been appealed to the dc circuit court  and rehearing requests have been filed with respect to the december order 
as well as the sfpp decision  which is currently on appeal  there are two other cases with respect to tax allowance pending in the dc circuit court including exxon mobil oil corporation v 
ferc and capp v 
ferc 
the dc circuit court heard oral arguments on these cases on december  a decision is expected by april at this time  the ultimate outcome of these proceedings is not certain and could result in changes to the ferc s treatment of income tax allowances in cost of service 
whether the income tax allowance policy is ultimately upheld or modified on judicial review  could affect the tariffs of ferc regulated pipelines 
a related issue is whether the ferc s income tax allowance policy can be relied upon by shippers as a substantial change in circumstances sufficient to remove the grandfathering protection under the ep act from an oil pipeline s rates 
the ferc determined in the sfpp case that its policy statement on income tax allowances does not represent a change from its pre ep act policy and therefore  cannot affect grandfathering of rates  a position that is still potentially subject to further judicial review 
at this time  the effect of the ferc s policy statement on income tax allowances on us is uncertain 
the tariff rates on our common carrier interstate liquids pipelines have been established under a variety of different circumstances including settlements and tariff indexing 
it is anticipated that a change in the income tax allowance policy would only impact those rates that were established after indexing 
even with the indexed rates  the income tax allowance is only one of many elements supporting our pipeline rates for service 
accordingly  we cannot predict with certainty what rates we will be allowed to charge in the future  or the potential impact on us of a change in the ferc s policy statement on income tax allowances 
we believe that the rates we charge for transportation services on our interstate common carrier liquids pipelines are just and reasonable under the ica 
however  because the rates that we charge are subject to review upon an appropriately supported protest or complaint  we cannot predict what rates we will be allowed to charge in the future for service on our interstate common carrier liquids pipelines 
furthermore  because rates charged for transportation services must be competitive with those charged by other transporters  the rates set forth in our tariffs will be determined based on competitive factors in addition to regulatory considerations 
competition may reduce our revenues 
our lakehead system faces current  and potentially further competition for transporting western canadian crude oil from other pipelines  which may reduce our revenues 
our lakehead system competes with other crude oil and refined product pipelines and other methods of delivering crude oil and refined products to the refining centers of minneapolis st 
paul  minnesota  chicago  illinois  detroit  michigan  toledo  ohio  buffalo  new york  and sarnia  ontario and the refinery market and pipeline hub located in the patoka wood river area of southern illinois 
refineries in the markets served by our lakehead system compete with refineries in western canada  the province of ontario and the rocky mountain region of the united states for supplies of western canadian crude oil 
our ozark pipeline system could face a significant increase in competition if a proposed new pipeline from hardisty  alberta to patoka is completed in however  if that situation occurs  we would consider potential alternative uses for our ozark system 
we also encounter competition in our natural gas gathering  treating  processing and transmission businesses 
a number of new interstate natural gas transmission pipelines being constructed could reduce the revenue we derive from the interstate and intrastate transmission of natural gas 
many of the large wholesale customers served by our systems transmission and wholesale customer pipelines have multiple pipelines connected or adjacent to their facilities 
thus  many of these wholesale customers have the ability to purchase natural gas directly from a number of pipelines and or from third parties that may hold capacity on other pipelines 
likewise  most natural gas producers and owners have alternate gathering and processing facilities available to them 
in addition  they have other alternatives  such as building their own gathering facilities or  in some cases  selling their natural gas supplies without processing 
some of our natural gas marketing competitors have greater financial resources and access to larger supplies of natural gas than those available to us  which could allow those competitors to price their services more aggressively than we do 
our gas marketing operations involve market and certain regulatory risks 
as part of our natural gas marketing activities  we purchase natural gas at prices determined by prevailing market conditions 
following our purchase of natural gas  we generally resell natural gas at a higher price under a sales contract that is generally comparable in terms to our purchase contract  including any price escalation provisions 
the profitability of our natural gas operations may be affected by the following factors our ability to negotiate on a timely basis natural gas purchase and sales agreements in changing markets  reluctance of wholesale customers to enter into long term purchase contracts  consumers willingness to use other fuels when natural gas prices increase significantly  timing of imbalance or volume discrepancy corrections and their impact on financial results  the ability of our customers to make timely payment  inability to match purchase and sale of natural gas on comparable terms  and changes in  limitations upon  or elimination of the regulatory authorization required for our wholesale sales of natural gas in interstate commerce 
our results may be adversely affected by commodity price volatility and risks associated with our hedging activities 
we buy and sell natural gas and ngls in connection with our marketing activities 
commodity price exposure is also inherent in gas purchase and resale activities and in gas processing 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to reduce our commodity price exposure  we may be prevented from realizing the full benefits of price increases above the level of the hedges 
further  hedging contracts are subject to the credit risk that the other party may prove unable or unwilling to perform its obligations under such contracts 
in addition certain of the financial instruments we use to hedge our commodity risk exposures must be accounted for on a mark to market basis 
this causes periodic earnings volatility due to turbulent commodity prices 
compliance with environmental and operational safety regulations  including any remediation of soil or water pollution or hydrostatic testing of our pipeline systems  may increase our costs and or reduce our revenues 
our pipeline  gathering  processing and trucking operations are subject to federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and operational and worker safety 
liquid petroleum and natural gas transportation and processing operations always involve the risk of costs or liabilities or operational modifications related to regulatory compliance as well as resulting from historical environmental contamination  accidental releases or upsets  regulatory enforcement  litigation or safety and health incidents 
as a result  we may incur costs or liabilities of this type  or experience a reduction in revenues  in the future 
we may also incur costs in the future due to changes in environmental and safety laws and regulations  enforcement policies or claims for personal  property or environmental damage 
we may not be able to recover these costs from insurance or through higher tariffs 
failure of pipeline operations due to unforeseen interruptions or catastrophic events may adversely affect our business and financial condition 
operation of complex pipeline systems  gathering  treating  processing and trucking operations involves many risks  hazards and uncertainties  such as operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions caused by events beyond our control 
these events include adverse weather conditions  accidents  the breakdown or failure of equipment or processes  the performance of the facilities below expected levels of capacity and efficiency and catastrophic events such as explosions  fires  earthquakes  hurricanes  floods  landslides or other similar events beyond our control 
a casualty occurrence might result in injury or loss of life or extensive property or environmental damage for which we may bear a part or all of the cost 
our acquisition strategy may be unsuccessful if we incorrectly predict operating results  are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and integrate acquired assets or businesses or are unable to raise financing on acceptable terms 
the acquisition of complementary energy delivery assets is a component of our strategy 
acquisitions present various risks and challenges  including the risk of incorrect assumptions regarding the future results of the acquired operations or expected cost reductions or other synergies expected to be realized as a result of acquiring such operations  the risk of failing to effectively integrate the operations or management of acquired assets or businesses or a significant delay in such integration  and diversion of management s attention from existing operations 
in addition  we may be unable to identify acquisition targets and consummate acquisitions in the future or be unable to raise  on terms we find acceptable  any debt or equity financing that may be required for any such acquisition 
our actual construction and development costs could exceed our forecast and our cash flow from construction and development projects may not be immediate which may limit our ability to increase cash distributions 
our strategy contemplates significant expenditures for the development  construction or other acquisitions of energy infrastructure assets 
increased demand for the steel used to fabricate the pipe needed for our construction projects and increased competition for labor has resulted in increased costs for these resources 
as a result  we may not be able to complete our projects at the costs currently estimated or within the time periods we have projected 
if we experience material cost overruns  we will have to finance these overruns using one or more of the following methods using cash from operations  delaying other planned projects  incurring additional indebtedness  or issuing additional equity 
any or all of these methods may not be available when needed or may adversely affect our future results operations and cash flows 
our revenues and cash flows may not increase immediately on our expenditure of funds on a particular project 
for example  if we build a new pipeline or expand an existing facility  the design  construction  development and installation may occur over an extended period of time and we may not receive any material increase in revenue or cash flow from that project until after it is placed in service and customers begin using the systems 
if our revenues and cash flow do not increase at projected levels because of substantial unanticipated delays  or other factors  we may not meet our obligations as they become due and we may need to reduce or reprioritize our capital budget  sell non strategic assets  access the capital markets or reassess our level of distributions to unitholders to meet our capital requirements 
measurement losses on our pipeline system can be materially impacted by changes in estimation  commodity prices and other factors 
oil measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our liquid petroleum pipelines 
the three types of oil measurement losses include physical losses  which occur through evaporation  shrinkage  differences in measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational incidents  degradation losses  which result from mixing at the interface between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines  and revaluation losses  which are a function of crude oil prices and the level of the carrier s inventory 
quantifying oil measurement losses is inherently difficult because physical measurements of volumes are not practical due to the fact that products constantly move through our pipelines and virtually all of our pipeline systems are located underground 
in our case  measuring and quantifying oil measurement losses is especially difficult because of the size and scope of our pipeline systems and the number of different grades of crude oil and types of crude oil products we carry 
accordingly  we utilize engineering based models and operational assumptions to estimate product volumes in our system and associated oil measurement losses 
natural gas measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our natural gas pipelines 
the quantification and resolution of measurement losses is complicated by several factors including the significant quantities ie  thousands of measurement meters that we use throughout our natural gas systems  primarily around our gathering and processing assets  varying qualities of natural gas in the streams gathered and processed through our systems  and variances in measurement that are inherent in metering technologies 
each of these factors may contribute to measurement losses that can occur on our natural gas systems 
the interests of enbridge may differ from our interests and the interests of our security holders  and the board of directors of enbridge management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict  not just the interests of our security holders  in making important business decisions 
enbridge indirectly owns all of the stock of our general partner and all of the voting stock of enbridge management  and elects all of the directors of both companies 
furthermore  some of the directors and officers of our general partners and enbridge management are also directors and officers of enbridge 
consequently  conflicts of interest could arise between our unitholders and enbridge 
our partnership agreement limits the fiduciary duties of our general partner to our unitholders 
these restrictions allow our general partner to resolve conflicts of interest by considering the interests of all of the parties to the conflict  including enbridge management s interests  our interests and those of our general partner 
in addition  these limitations reduce the rights of our unitholders under our partnership agreement to sue our general partner or enbridge management  its delegee  should its directors or officers act in a way that  were it not for these limitations of liability  would constitute breaches of their fiduciary duties 
we do not have any employees 
in managing our business and affairs  we will rely on employees of enbridge  and its affiliates  who will act on behalf of and as agents for us 
a decrease in the availability of employees from enbridge could adversely affect us 
we are exposed to credit risks of our customers for example our bamagas system has agreements to provide transportation of up to  mmbtu d of natural gas for a remaining period of years to two utility plants that are indirectly owned by calpine corporation calpine 
the bamagas system receives a fixed demand charge of per mmbtu of natural gas for  mmbtu d  regardless of whether the capacity is used 
in december  calpine and many of its subsidiaries  including the subsidiary that owns the two utility plants served by our bamagas system  filed voluntarily petitions to restructure under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
in connection with the bankruptcy filing  calpine has announced receipt of commitments for up to billion of debtor in possession  or dip financing to allow for the continued operation of its power plants 
our bamagas system is the sole supplier of natural gas to these two utility plants  and we expect the subsidiary that owns these utility plants to continue performing under the terms of our agreement 
although we fully expect our customer to continue to meet its obligations to us under the terms of the transportation agreements  we are exposed to a potential asset impairment of up to million  representing the book value of the pipeline  if the customer is unable to fulfill its commitments 
in april  calpine announced its intent to sell approximately of its non core and non strategic power plants  although the plants to be sold have not been announced 
calpine has continued to perform under the terms of its agreement with bamagas and we remain confident that any losses we may incur with respect to calpine s bankruptcy will be minimal 
we continue to monitor the calpine bankruptcy proceedings and will recognize any losses that may result when it becomes evident that a loss has been incurred 
canada s ratification of the kyoto protocol may adversely impact our operations 
in december  canada ratified the kyoto protocol  a treaty designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to below levels 
we and enbridge are monitoring the canadian federal government s approach to implementation 
while the united states is not a signatory to the kyoto protocol  other environmental protection initiatives have been implemented regulating certain priority pollutants 
revisions have been proposed to the us energy act that would  if passed  expand the regulation of certain greenhouse gas emissions requiring a cap and establishing a trade to facilitate compliance 
such provisions would make natural gas pipelines the segment of the gas industry regulated by an amendment 
while proposed legislation has not yet passed and as other legislation is being proposed the outcome is uncertain at this time 
if and when these provisions pass the partnership could be subject to additional costs to monitor and control emissions above and beyond current practices and permits 
risks arising from our partnership structure and relationships with our general partner and enbridge management our partnership agreement and the delegation of control agreement limit the fiduciary duties that enbridge management and our general partner owe to our unitholders and restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by enbridge management and our general partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty 
our partnership agreement contains provisions that modify the fiduciary duties that our general partner would otherwise owe to our unitholders under state fiduciary duty law 
through the delegation of control agreement  these modified fiduciary duties also apply to enbridge management as the delegate of our general partner 
for example  our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions  including the determination of which factors it will consider in resolving conflicts of interest  in its sole discretion 
this entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires  and it has no duty or obligation to give consideration to any interest of  or factors affecting  us  our affiliates or any unitholder  provides that any standard of care and duty imposed on our general partner will be modified  waived or limited as required to permit our general partner to act under our partnership agreement and to make any decision pursuant to the authority prescribed in our partnership agreement  so long as such action is reasonably believed by the general partner to be in our best interests  and provides that our general partner and its directors and officers will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our unitholders for any acts or omissions if they acted in good faith 
these and similar provisions in our partnership agreement may restrict the remedies available to our unitholders for actions taken by enbridge management or our general partner that might otherwise constitute a breach of a fiduciary duty 
potential conflicts of interest may arise among enbridge and its shareholders  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
because the fiduciary duties of the directors of our general partner and enbridge management have been modified  the directors may be permitted to make decisions that benefit enbridge and its shareholders or enbridge management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders 
conflicts of interest may arise from time to time among enbridge and its shareholders  on the one hand  and us and our unitholders and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
conflicts of interest may also arise from time to time between us and our unitholders  on the one hand  and enbridge management and its shareholders  on the other hand 
in managing and controlling us as the delegate of our general partner  enbridge management may consider the interests of all parties to a conflict and may resolve those conflicts by making decisions that benefit enbridge and its shareholders or enbridge management and its shareholders more than us and our unitholders 
the following decisions  among others  could involve conflicts of interest whether we or enbridge will pursue certain acquisitions or other business opportunities  whether we will issue additional units or other equity securities or whether we will purchase outstanding units  whether enbridge management will issue additional shares  the amount of payments to enbridge and its affiliates for any services rendered for our benefit  the amount of costs that are reimbursable to enbridge management or enbridge and its affiliates by us  the enforcement of obligations owed to us by enbridge management  our general partner or enbridge  including obligations regarding competition between enbridge and us  and the retention of separate counsel  accountants or others to perform services for us and enbridge management 
in these and similar situations  any decision by enbridge management may benefit one group more than another  and in making such decisions  enbridge management may consider the interests of all groups  as well as other factors  in deciding whether to take a particular course of action 
in other situations  enbridge may take certain actions  including engaging in businesses that compete with us  that are adverse to us and our unitholders 
for example  although enbridge and its subsidiaries are generally restricted from engaging in any business that is in direct material competition with our businesses  that restriction is subject to the following significant exceptions enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from continuing to engage in businesses  including the normal development of such businesses  in which they were engaged at the time of our initial public offering in december  such restriction is limited geographically only to those routes and products for which we provided transportation at the time of our initial public offering  enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us as part of a larger acquisition  so long as the majority of the value of the business or assets acquired  in enbridge s reasonable judgment  is not attributable to the competitive business  and enbridge and its subsidiaries are not prohibited from acquiring any business that materially and directly competes with us if that business is first offered for acquisition to us and the board of directors of enbridge management and our unitholders determine not to pursue the acquisition 
since we were not engaged in any aspect of the natural gas business at the time of our initial public offering  enbridge and its subsidiaries are not restricted from competing with us in any aspect of the natural gas business 
in addition  enbridge and its subsidiaries would be permitted to transport crude oil and liquid petroleum over routes that are not the same as our lakehead system  even if such transportation is in direct material competition with our business 
these exceptions also expressly permitted the reversal by enbridge in of one of its pipelines that extends from sarnia  ontario to montreal  quebec 
as a result of this reversal  enbridge competes with us to supply crude oil to the ontario  canada market 
we can issue additional common or other classes of units  including additional i units to enbridge management when it issues additional shares  which would dilute your ownership interest 
the issuance of additional common or other classes of units by us  including the issuance of additional i units to enbridge management when it issues additional shares and the issuance of additional class c units  other than our quarterly distributions to you  may have the following effects the amount available for distributions on each unit may decrease  the relative voting power of each previously outstanding unit may decrease  and the market price of the class a common units may decline 
additionally  the public sale by our general partner of a significant portion of the class b common units or class c units that it currently owns could reduce the market price of the class a common units 
our partnership agreement allows the general partner to cause us to register for public sale any units held by the general partner or its affiliates 
a public or private sale of the class b common units or class c units currently held by our general partner could absorb some of the trading market demand for the outstanding class a common units 
we are a holding company and depend entirely on our operating subsidiaries distributions to service our debt obligations 
we are a holding company with no material operations 
if we cannot receive cash distributions from our operating subsidiaries  we will not be able to meet our debt service obligations 
our operating subsidiaries may from time to time incur additional indebtedness under agreements that contain restrictions  which could further limit each operating subsidiary s ability to make distributions to us 
the debt securities we issue and any guarantees issued by the subsidiary guarantors will be structurally subordinated to the claims of the creditors of any of our operating subsidiaries who are not guarantors of the debt securities 
holders of the debt securities will not be creditors of our operating subsidiaries who have not guaranteed the debt securities 
the claims to the assets of these non guarantor operating subsidiaries derive from our own ownership interest in those operating subsidiaries 
claims of our non guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors will generally have priority as to the assets of such operating subsidiaries over our own ownership interest claims and will therefore have priority over the holders of our debt  including the debt securities 
our non guarantor operating subsidiaries creditors may include general creditors  trade creditors  secured creditors  taxing authorities  and creditors holding guarantees 
enbridge management s discretion in establishing our cash reserves gives it the ability to reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
enbridge management may establish cash reserves for us that in its reasonable discretion are necessary to fund our future operating and capital expenditures  provide for the proper conduct of business  and comply with applicable law or agreements to which we are a party or to provide funds for future distributions to partners 
these cash reserves affect the amount of cash available for distribution to our holders of common units 
risks related to our debt and our ability to distribute cash agreements relating to our debt restrict our ability to make distributions  which could adversely affect the value of our class a common units  and our ability to incur additional debt and otherwise maintain financial and operating flexibility 
our primary operating subsidiary is prohibited by its first mortgage notes from making distributions to us  and we are prohibited by our credit facility from making distributions to our unitholders  if a default exists under the respective governing agreements 
in addition  the agreements governing our credit facility and our subsidiary s first mortgage notes may prevent us from engaging in transactions or capitalizing on business opportunities that we believe could be beneficial to us by requiring us to comply with various covenants  including the maintenance of certain financial ratios and restrictions on incurring additional debt  entering into mergers or consolidations or sales of assets  and granting liens 
although the indentures governing our senior notes do not limit our ability to incur additional debt  they impose restrictions on our ability to enter into mergers or consolidations and sales of assets and to incur liens to secure debt 
a breach of any restriction under our credit facility or our indentures or our subsidiary s first mortgage notes could permit the holders of the related debt to declare all amounts outstanding under those agreements immediately due and payable and  in the case of the credit facility  terminate all commitments to extend further credit 
any subsequent refinancing of our current debt or any new indebtedness incurred by us or our subsidiaries could have similar or greater restrictions 
tax risks to common unitholders we may be classified as an association taxable as a corporation rather than as a partnership  which would substantially reduce the value of our class a common units 
we could be treated as a corporation for united states income tax purposes 
our treatment as a corporation would substantially reduce the cash distributions on the common units that we distribute quarterly 
moreover  treatment of us as a corporation could materially and adversely affect our ability to make payments on our debt securities 
the anticipated benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on the treatment of us as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
under current law  we are treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and do not pay any federal income tax at the entity level 
in order to qualify for this treatment  we must derive more than of our annual gross income from specified investments and activities 
while we believe that we currently do qualify and intend to meet this income requirement  we may not find it possible  regardless of our efforts  to meet this income requirement or may inadvertently fail to meet this income requirement 
current law may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes without regard to our sources of income or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
if we were to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our income at the corporate tax rate  which is currently a maximum of and would pay state income taxes at varying rates 
under current law  distributions to unitholders would generally be taxed as a corporate distribution 
because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation  the cash available for distribution to a unitholder would be substantially reduced 
treatment of us as a corporation would cause a substantial reduction in the value of our units 
in addition  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise  or other forms of taxation 
state tax legislation resulting in the imposition of a partnership level income tax on us would reduce the cash distributions on the common units and the value of the i units that we will distribute quarterly to enbridge management 
the enactment of significant legislation imposing partnership level income taxes could cause a reduction in the value of our units 
if the internal revenue service does not respect our curative tax allocations  the after tax return to our unitholders on their investment in our class a common units would be adversely affected 
our partnership agreement allows curative allocations of income  deduction  gain and loss by us to account for differences between the tax basis and fair market value of property at the time the property is contributed or deemed contributed to us and to account for differences between the fair market value and book basis of our assets existing at the time of issuance of any class a common units 
if the internal revenue service  which we refer to as the irs  does not respect our curative allocations  ratios of taxable income to cash distributions received by the holders of class a common units will be materially higher than previously estimated the tax liability of our unitholders could exceed their distributions or proceeds from sales of class a common units 
the holders of our class a common units will be required to pay united states federal income tax and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on their allocable share of our income  even if they do not receive cash distributions from us 
they will not necessarily receive cash distributions equal to the tax on their allocable share of our taxable income 
further  if we have a large amount of nonrecourse liabilities  they may incur a tax liability that is greater than the money they receive when they sell their class a common units 
a unitholder may be required to file tax returns with and pay income taxes to the states where we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business 
in some cases  a unitholder may be required to file income tax returns with and pay income taxes to the states in which we or our subsidiaries own property and conduct business  which are currently alabama  arkansas  florida  georgia  illinois  indiana  kansas  kentucky  louisiana  michigan  minnesota  mississippi  missouri  montana  new york  south carolina  north carolina  north dakota  oklahoma  tennessee  texas and wisconsin 
in the future  we may acquire property or do business in other states or in foreign jurisdictions 
in addition to tax liabilities to such state and foreign jurisdictions  the owner of a class a common unit may also incur tax and filing responsibilities to localities within such jurisdictions 
ownership of class a common units raises issues for tax exempt entities and other investors 
an investment in our class a common units by tax exempt entities  including employee benefit plans  individual retirement accounts  keogh plans and other retirement plans  regulated investment companies and foreign persons raises issues unique to them 
virtually all of the income derived from our class a common units by a tax exempt entity will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to the tax exempt entity 
further  a unitholder who is a nonresident alien  a foreign corporation or other foreign person will be required to file a federal income tax return and pay tax on his share of our taxable income because he will be regarded as being engaged in a trade or business in the united states as a result of his ownership of a class a common unit 
our registration with the secretary of the treasury as a tax shelter may increase your risk of an irs audit 
because we are a registered tax shelter with the secretary of the treasury  a unitholder may face an increased risk of an irs audit resulting in taxes payable on our income as well as income not related to us 
we could be audited by the irs and adjustments to our income or losses could be made 
any unitholder owning less than a profit interest in us has very limited rights to participate in the income tax and audit process 
further  any adjustments in our tax returns will lead to adjustments in the unitholders tax returns and may lead to audits of unitholders tax returns and adjustments of items unrelated to us 
each unitholder is responsible for any tax owed as the result of an examination of their personal tax return 
our treatment of a purchaser of class a common units as having the same tax benefits as the seller could be challenged  resulting in a reduction in value of the class a common units 
because we cannot match transferors and transferees of class a common units  we are required to maintain the uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of these units in the hands of the purchasers and sellers of these units 
we do so by adopting certain depreciation conventions that do not conform to all aspects of the united states treasury regulations 
an irs challenge to these conventions could adversely affect the tax benefits to a unitholder of ownership of the class a common units and could have a negative impact on their value

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes beginning on page f of this annual report on form k 
results of operations overview we provide services to our customers and returns for our unitholders primarily through the following activities interstate pipeline transportation and storage of crude oil and liquid petroleum  gathering  treating  processing and transportation of natural gas and ngls through pipelines and related facilities  and providing supply  transportation and sales services  including purchasing and selling of natural gas and ngls 
we conduct our business through three business segments liquids  natural gas and marketing 
these segments are strategic business units established by senior management to facilitate the achievement of our long term objectives  to aid in resource allocation decisions and to assess operational performance 
our liquids segment includes the operations of our lakehead  north dakota and mid continent systems 
each of these systems largely consists of ferc regulated interstate crude oil and liquid petroleum pipelines 
our mid continent system is also one of the largest above ground crude oil storage facilities in north america  with the majority of the capacity available for contract storage not subject to regulation by the ferc 
each of these systems generates most of its revenues by charging shippers a per barrel tariff rate to transport and store crude oil and liquid petroleum 
our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  including four ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipelines  as well as natural gas treating and processing plants and related facilities 
the revenues of our natural gas segment are derived from the fees we charge to gather and process natural gas and the rates we charge to transport natural gas on our pipelines 
our marketing segment provides supply  transmission  storage and sales services to producers and wholesale customers on our gathering  transmission and customer pipelines  as well as other interconnected pipeline systems 
our marketing activities are primarily undertaken to realize incremental revenue on gas purchased at the wellhead  increase pipeline utilization and provide other services that are valued by our customers 
several types of arrangements in our natural gas and marketing segments expose us to market risk associated with changes in commodity prices where we receive natural gas or ngls in return for the services we provide  or where we purchase natural gas or ngls 
we employ derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to natural gas and ngl prices 
some of these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under the provisions of sfas no 
 which can create volatility in our earnings that can be significant 
however  these fluctuations in earnings do not affect our cash flow 
cash flow is only affected when we settle the derivative financial instrument 
the following table reflects our operating income by business segment and corporate charges for each of the years ended december in millions operating income liquids natural gas marketing corporate  operating and administrative total operating income interest expense rate refunds other income net income summary analysis of operating results liquids our liquids segment contributed operating income of million in  or million more than the million contributed in the operating income of our liquids segment in was affected by the following factors higher volumes on our lakehead system following completion of the repair and expansion of a major oil sands plant that was damaged by fire in early january  partially offset by higher power costs associated with the increased volumes  the annual index rate increase effective july   which increased our average tariffs  longer transportation hauls on our lakehead system  and lower oil measurement losses 
natural gas operating income from our natural gas segment grew to million in representing an increase of million over the million generated in the increased contribution of our natural gas segment is attributable to the following average daily volume on our major natural gas systems was percent greater in than in  due to continuing investments to expand the capacity of our three largest natural gas systems 
the volume and revenue growth is also the result of additional wellhead supply contracts and robust drilling activity in the anadarko basin  bossier trend and barnett shale 
also contributing to the increase in volumes is an mile pipeline we acquired in april that is complimentary to our existing east texas system and provided approximately  million british thermal units per day  or mmbtu d  of incremental volume 
increased processing capacity from the expansion of our existing zybach processing facility on our anadarko system that we completed in the second quarter of and the construction of our henderson natural gas processing facility on our east texas system completed in the third quarter of favorable commodity prices where ngl and crude oil prices remained high relative to natural gas prices  which have declined from the high prices reached in late  contributed to improved results from our processing activities 
ngl purchase  transportation and fractionation costs that are predominantly associated with prior years were corrected in  partially offsetting the increased contribution to operating income discussed above 
also partially offsetting the improvements to operating income noted above are increases in operating and administrative costs that are mostly variable with the incremental volumes gathered  processed and transported on our systems and the workforce related costs we are charged for the additional resources and related benefits necessary to operate and support our existing assets and the expansion of our natural gas systems 
additionally  our repair and maintenance costs have increased due to additional pipeline integrity and other work we perform to maintain the service capability of our systems 
marketing operating income from our marketing segment increased in from operating losses for the comparable period in the change in operating income from to resulted from the following unrealized  non cash mark to market net gains for of million compared with non cash mark to market net losses of million for the gains resulted from the change in market value of our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting  partially offsetting the unrealized mark to market gains is a non cash charge of million for the year ended december   resulting from a lower of cost or market accounting adjustment to the cost basis of our natural gas inventory 
the market price for natural gas in various storage locations experienced declines during the year from the prices at which the inventory was purchased 
we use derivative financial instruments to fix the price of our forecasted sales of inventory and as a result we expect that a majority of this charge will be offset by future financial and physical transactions that will settle at the time we sell the inventory 
derivative transactions and hedging activities we record all financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements at fair market value pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
for those derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting  all changes in fair market value are recorded through our consolidated statements of income each period 
the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or receive to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date  although that is not our intent 
declining natural gas prices during our fiscal year ended december   produced non cash mark to market gains of million and positively affected our operating results 
mark to market gains or losses create volatility in our results 
the derivative financial instruments we have in place do not affect our cash flow until they are settled 
we expect these non cash gains or losses to reverse in future periods as we settle the derivative financial instruments against the underlying physical transactions 
because of the economic benefit we receive by minimizing the volatility in our cash flows by using derivative financial instruments to hedge our portfolio of natural gas and ngls  we intend to continue using them 
our continued use of derivative financial instruments may result in additional unrealized  non cash gains or losses in the future 
the following table presents the unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of our derivatives  which are recorded as an element of cost of natural gas in our consolidated statements of income and disclosed as a reconciling item on our statements of cash flows derivative fair value gains losses december  december  december  in millions natural gas segment hedge ineffectiveness non qualified hedges marketing non qualified hedges discontinued hedges derivative fair value gains losses de designation and settlement of derivatives in connection with the sale of assets in december  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report  we settled for cash of approximately million  natural gas collars representing derivative financial instruments on sales of  mmbtu d of natural gas through we had previously recorded unrealized losses associated with the natural gas collars that were realized upon settlement 
additionally  we de designated derivative financial instruments that qualified for and were designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted sales of bpd of ngls through and contemporaneously closed out the position by entering into an offsetting derivative financial instrument  at market  on forecasted purchases of bpd of ngls through results of operations by segment liquids our liquids segment includes the operations of our lakehead  north dakota  and mid continent systems 
we provide a detailed description of each of these systems in item business 
the following tables set forth the operating results and statistics of our liquids segment for the periods presented dollars in millions operating results operating revenues operating and administrative power depreciation and amortization operating expenses operating income operating statistics lakehead system united states province of ontario total deliveries barrel miles billions average haul miles mid continent system deliveries north dakota system deliveries total liquids segment delivery volumes average barrels per day in thousands 
ten months of deliveries in year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income in  representing an increase of million over the favorable results of the liquids segment assets reflect continuing growth in our transportation volumes while actively managing the costs of our services 
the majority of this increase related to significantly improved results on our lakehead system 
operating revenue in increased by million to million  compared with million in as indicated in the table above  total delivery volumes of our liquids segment averaged million bpd in  representing a million bpd increase from the million bpd delivered in this accounted for an increase in operating revenues of approximately million 
the increases in deliveries on our liquids systems are primarily derived from increased production of western canadian crude oil delivered on our lakehead system 
the increases in deliveries are attributable to the following suncor  an oil sands producer in alberta  canada  experienced a fire at its upgrade site in january  which affected production for the majority of in late september  suncor completed repairs and an expansion to its upgrader site 
suncor s production levels have increased since that time 
conventional light  heavy crude oil and bitumen production have increased as existing and new facilities were commissioned during syncrude  another oil sands producer in alberta completed its stage expansion and initiated production on its coker unit in may enabling all stage units to be brought on line 
however  shortly following start up  an ammonia leak resulted in its closure until august additionally  as a result of a leak discovered in november  the coker unit was closed for turnaround into the stage expansion is designed to increase productive capacity from  bpd to an average  bpd of a light synthetic crude oil 
our deliveries in were marginally higher as a result of syncrude s completion and start up of its stage expansion 
contributing to the revenue growth of our liquids segment are the increases in the average tariffs on all three of our liquids systems 
these tariff increases were partly the result of the annual index rate increase allowed by the ferc 
on our lakehead system  we increased our rates by an average of three percent 
also on our lakehead system  new tariffs went into effect on april  for an adjustment on the terrace expansion program surcharge due to lower than expected volumes moving on the lakehead system  and new facilities in service  that were not operating during these tariff increases  along with the four percent increase in average hauls from miles in compared with in resulted in a combined increase in operating revenue of approximately million 
continuing volume growth related to our mid continent storage terminal system in cushing  oklahoma  and el dorado  kansas  has resulted in an increase in operating revenue of approximately million compared with net capacity additions in bring the total storage capacity to tanks and approximately million barrels 
this additional storage capacity is expected to provide ongoing fixed  variable  and spot storage revenue 
operating and administrative expenses for were million  or million less than in  primarily as a result of decreased oil measurement losses which are partially offset by increased workforce related costs and materials  supplies  and other general costs 
workforce related costs increased due to the additional resources and related benefit costs we are charged for the operational  administrative  regulatory and compliance support necessary for our growing systems 
our general partner charges us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel that are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
the portion of compensation and related costs we are charged is dependent upon such items as estimated time spent  miles of pipe and headcount 
we have experienced an increase in workforce related costs as a result of the growth and expansion of our liquids system operations 
we expect these costs will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to expand our liquids system operations 
materials  supplies and other  and repair and maintenance costs were both higher in compared with due to higher pipeline inspection costs associated with our pipeline integrity management programs  increased outside contractor services  field inventory adjustments and other general costs 
inventory adjustments include oil measurement losses  which occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our liquids pipelines  include the following three elements physical losses  which occur through evaporation  shrinkage  differences in measurement between receipt and delivery locations and other operational factors  degradation losses  which result from mixing at the interface between higher quality light crude oil and lower quality heavy crude oil in pipelines  and revaluation losses  which are a function of crude oil prices  the level of the carrier s inventory and the inventory positions of customers 
during the fourth quarter of  we identified certain operating conditions on connected third party systems that were contributing to higher levels of physical losses on our lakehead system 
improvements to our oil measurement processes have resulted in fewer physical losses during on our lakehead and mid continent systems 
we expect these improvements to have a continuing positive impact on our oil measurement losses going forward 
power costs increased million in  compared with  primarily due to the increase in volumes transported on our lakehead system and higher electricity rates we are charged by our power suppliers 
we have experienced a trend of increasing electricity rates from our power suppliers due to higher natural gas costs 
we completed a depreciation study of the lakehead system in the first quarter of that resulted in extending the composite remaining service life of the system assets from to years 
the impact of the depreciation study was an million reduction of depreciation expense for the full year of year ended december  compared with year ended december  our liquids segment accounted for million of operating income in  representing a decrease of million or eight percent over lower results on the lakehead system were modestly offset by stronger results on our north dakota system and a full twelve month contribution from our mid continent system compared with a ten month contribution for the same period in operating revenue in increased by million or two percent to million  compared with million for our mid continent assets contributed higher operating revenue of approximately million for the additional two months of ownership in compared to overall tariff increases and longer hauls on our north dakota system were mostly offset by lower deliveries on the lakehead system during average daily crude oil deliveries on the lakehead system decreased approximately percent  from million bpd during to million bpd during this resulted in lower operating revenue for of approximately million 
the decrease is the result of lower than expected crude oil supply in western canada from three factors 
first  suncor  an oil sands producer in alberta  canada  had a fire at their upgrader site on january  as a result of the incident  suncor s production was reduced by an average of  bpd during the first nine months of in late september  suncor announced that repairs to the upgrader site and an expansion were completed and production capacity has increased as a result 
second  western canadian crude oil supply available for delivery on our lakehead system was also reduced during due to lower bitumen supplies 
the nature of the cyclic steaming process used to extract bitumen from the ground can cause production timing differences during the year 
finally  during the second quarter of  kinder morgan  inc  an unrelated company  completed an expansion on its express pipeline system 
the expansion increased capacity on this pipeline by approximately  bpd 
given the volume commitments on the express pipeline expansion  coupled with the lower western canadian crude oil supply as noted above  deliveries on our lakehead system were negatively impacted for management believes that holders of firm capacity on the express pipeline will first satisfy their commitments to that pipeline before moving incremental barrels on the lakehead system 
increases in average tariffs on all three liquids systems resulted in higher operating revenue by approximately million 
these tariff increases were partly the result of the annual index rate increase of approximately allowed by the ferc that became effective july   on our base system tariffs 
on the lakehead system  new tariffs also went into effect on april  for an adjustment on the terrace expansion program surcharge due to lower than expected volumes moving on the lakehead system 
longer hauls on our north dakota system also contributed to higher average tariffs  as production in montana continued to be strong during operating and administrative expenses for increased by million to million  compared with million in the increase was attributable to the following factors workforce related costs increased by approximately million due to the additional resources and related benefit costs we are charged for the operational  administrative  regulatory and compliance support necessary for our growing systems  operating and administrative expenses on our mid continent system increased approximately million due to a full year s ownership in  compared with ten months in  capital project recoveries were lower by approximately million due to a decrease in utilization of our workforce on capital projects and a reduction in construction activity on our liquids systems  oil measurement losses increased approximately million 
oil measurement losses occur as part of the normal operating conditions associated with our liquids pipelines 
during  the increase in oil measurement losses was a function of the following two factors higher volumetric physical losses associated with changes in commodity properties and measurement  coupled with higher oil prices that made the monetary value of normal physical losses more expensive 
during  the average west texas intermediate crude oil price was approximately per barrel compared with approximately per barrel during  wider light heavy crude price differentials made degradation losses more expensive 
during  light heavy differentials were approximately per barrel compared with approximately per barrel in power costs increased million  or three percent  in compared with  mostly due to higher electricity rates and a full twelve month contribution from our mid continent system compared to ten months in  partially offset by lower energy consumption related to lower lakehead volumes 
power costs associated with the mid continent system increased approximately million in depreciation and amortization increased million  or five percent  in compared with the increase is driven primarily by a full twelve month contribution from our mid continent system and an increase in the depreciable asset base on our lakehead system in future prospects for liquids historically  western canada has been a key source of oil supply serving us energy needs 
canada s oil sands  one of the largest oil reserves in the world  are becoming an increasingly prominent source of supply 
combined conventional and oil sands established reserves of approximately billion barrels  compared with saudi arabia s proved reserves of approximately billion barrels 
the national energy board  or neb  estimates that total western canadian sedimentary basin  or wcsb  production averaged approximately million bpd compared with million bpd in according to production forecasts by capp  western canadian crude oil production is projected to grow progressively from approximately million bpd in to million bpd by conventional crude oil production is expected to decline from approximately million bpd to approximately  bpd over the same period 
the net increased production is expected to result from an estimated billion of active or planned projects that are being developed in the oil sands 
the projected growth in western canadian crude production will require construction of new pipelines to ensure new oil supplies can be transported to markets in the united states 
we and enbridge are actively working with our customers to develop transportation options that will allow canadian crude oil greater access to markets in the united states 
partnership projects southern access in conjunction with enbridge  we announced in the approval of the  bpd southern access expansion project  which received endorsement from capp  a trade association that represents a large majority of the lakehead system s customers 
we are undertaking the us portion of the expansion on our lakehead system and the first stage will add approximately  bpd of capacity in and up to an additional  bpd by early the project includes a new pipeline between superior and delavan  wisconsin  along with pump station enhancements upstream and downstream of this segment 
the second stage of the expansion project will provide additional upstream pumping capacity and a new pipeline from delavan to flanagan  illinois  with completion expected in early completion of the total southern access expansion project will create a mile pipeline with approximately  bpd of incremental capacity on our lakehead system 
on march   the ferc approved an offer of settlement with respect to tariff principles for the southern access expansion  which were negotiated with capp 
in july  we obtained support from shippers and capp to increase the diameter of the new pipeline segments of the project from inches  to which the previously negotiated tariff principles apply  up to inches 
the incremental capital cost of the larger diameter pipe is currently estimated at approximately million  bringing our total estimated costs to approximately billion 
the larger diameter will not provide increased capacity in the near term but does increase the ultimate capacity of the line from  bpd to  bpd with expenditures for additional pumping equipment 
this places us in a favorable position to secure future expansion opportunities for our lakehead system 
we will defer any return on the incremental capital until the additional capacity is required by shippers see discussion of alberta clipper project below 
in the interim  shippers will absorb all the incremental operating costs of the larger diameter line but will benefit from reduced power costs at higher throughput levels 
delivery of line pipe to the right of way has commenced to ensure full completion in early alberta clipper based on forecasts of oil sands production growth prepared by enbridge  as well as forecasts by capp  we believe that there will be a need for additional export pipeline capacity out of western canada over and above projects which have already received shipper support 
based on this analysis  as well as interest expressed by shippers  we and enbridge are planning to develop the alberta clipper project 
this project will involve construction of a inch diameter heavy crude line from hardisty  alberta to superior  wisconsin in conjunction with additional pumping power applied to the southern access inch pipe from superior to flanagan 
we anticipate that our share of the cost of this project  as currently proposed  will approximate billion in dollars  excluding both capitalized interest and the approximate cost of million to prebuild southern access to inches as discussed above 
alberta clipper was originally planned to be a contract carrier pipeline based on interest expressed by selected shippers in providing throughput commitments in return for assured access to capacity 
based on discussions with a broader group of shippers the preference is for alberta clipper to be a common carrier line fully integrated with the enbridge lakehead mainline systems for tolling purposes 
enbridge anticipates finalizing commercial terms of the alberta clipper project with capp during the first quarter of to maintain the project construction schedule  capp has agreed to backstop initial capital costs of the alberta clipper project 
initial capital costs will include long lead time items such as pipe  pumping equipment and rights of way 
in the unlikely event the alberta clipper project does not proceed  capp will support the collection of the initial capital costs through the partnership s normal ferc rate setting process 
alberta clipper is expected to be in service between late and mid north dakota work is proceeding on our previously announced north dakota system expansion 
three critical hydrostatic pressure tests have been successfully completed and the north dakota public service commission approvals have been obtained for all phases of the project 
the expansion will add approximately  bpd of mainline throughput capacity and expand the system s feeder segment by approximately  bpd at an estimated cost of million 
the expansion is supported by increasing crude oil production from the williston basin in montana and north dakota and is expected to be completed in phases throughout  with the final completion dates scheduled in the fourth quarter of superior and griffith storage due to forecasted production increases of synthetic heavy crude oil that we anticipate will be transported on the enbridge lakehead mainline systems from western canada to chicago  we are constructing additional crude oil storage tanks at superior and griffith to accommodate the anticipated volumes 
we are building two tanks with an approximate capacity of  barrels each that are scheduled for completion in the first half of  and two additional tanks each with an approximate capacity of  barrels each to be completed in the first half of cushing terminal storage we continue to experience strong interest from customers in securing access to long term contract storage capacity at our cushing  oklahoma terminal 
during  we obtained commitments and initiated construction of an additional million barrels of storage tanks  million barrels of which were completed in late december the addition of the remaining million barrels of capacity during  at an expected cost of million  will bring our total terminal capacity to approximately million barrels 
this capacity will increase operational tankage available to support our mid continent liquids pipeline systems  and available contract storage 
enbridge and other projects spearhead reversal in another effort to provide shippers access to new markets  enbridge acquired a pipeline that runs from cushing to chicago  illinois 
the pipeline  renamed spearhead  began delivering canadian crude oil to the major oil hub at cushing in march and has ongoing capacity of approximately  bpd 
we have benefited from reversal of the pipeline due to western canadian crude oil being carried on our lakehead system as far as chicago  and then transferred to the spearhead pipeline 
pegasus reversal in april  exxonmobil completed the reversal of two of its crude oil pipelines allowing up to  bpd of canadian crude oil to flow from the us midwest to the us gulf coast 
the combined reversed pipeline is linked to our lakehead system at chicago via the mustang pipe line partners system to patoka  illinois 
the mustang pipe line partners system is percent owned by an affiliate of enbridge 
exxonmobil has firm commitments from canadian shippers for an average of  bpd of capacity on the lines from patoka  to nederland  texas for the next five years 
the connection of our lakehead system with this new market supports increased throughput on our lakehead system  however  the reversed exxonmobil system is also capable of transporting western canadian crude oil moved via other competing pipelines into the patoka market 
southern access extension in july  enbridge announced that it received support from shippers and capp for its inch diameter southern access extension pipeline from flanagan  illinois to patoka  illinois 
the extension will broaden the reach of the enbridge lakehead mainline system to incremental markets accessible from the patoka hub 
the project is scheduled for completion in the first quarter of and will be undertaken by enbridge  however  we will benefit through incremental volumes moving through our lakehead system to reach this extension 
the offer of settlement filed in september was rejected by the ferc because of its rolled in toll design 
however  support for the project remains high and enbridge is working with shippers to prepare an alternative tolling structure to address the initial opposition 
the second application is expected to be filed with the ferc in the first quarter of and will allow the project to proceed on schedule 
southern lights during the third quarter of  enbridge completed a successful open season on its southern lights diluent pipeline from chicago  illinois to edmonton  alberta 
the southern lights pipeline responds to interest from a number of western canadian producers to increase the availability of crude oil diluent in alberta 
diluent is required to transport the heavy oil and bitumen being produced in increasing volumes from the alberta oil sands 
the project involves the exchange of a mile section of pipeline we own for a similar section of a new pipeline to be constructed as part of the project 
we expect to benefit from increased heavy crude shipments  which will be facilitated by the diluent line 
in addition  this project involves a reconfiguration of our light crude mainline system which will provide an additional  bpd of effective capacity at no cost to us 
this project is expected to be in service during us gulf coast access shippers have indicated interest to enbridge in the development of additional pipeline capacity to transport canadian crude oil to the us gulf coast  including the potential for a direct line from alberta to the us gulf coast 
enbridge is examining a number of alternatives to respond to this interest  including alternatives that would extend off our lakehead system  utilizing either existing pipelines which could be connected and reversed  or newly constructed extensions 
these alternatives would complement our lakehead system and support its expansion 
enbridge has indicated that a direct line would require a minimum of  bpd of throughput commitments to be economic  and could not be in service before a direct line  if developed by enbridge or any other party  would compete with our lakehead system 
eastern padd ii access enbridge has held discussions with several refiners in the eastern united states to gauge interest in supporting the development of a pipeline to provide incremental pipeline capacity to this market 
the level of interest has increased significantly during the latter part of enbridge is currently in discussions with interested parties to develop a pipeline to deliver at least  bpd of incremental canadian supply from the chicago area to the eastern region of padd ii 
this project would be complementary to the partnership s mainline system 
the partnership and enbridge believe that the southern access expansion program  the alberta clipper project  and other initiatives to provide access to new markets in the midwest  mid continent and gulf coast  offer flexible solutions to future transportation requirements of western canadian crude oil producers  and the in service timing of these solutions is in line with prospective shipper needs 
natural gas our natural gas segment consists of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines  as well as treating and processing plants and related facilities 
collectively  these systems include approximately  miles of natural gas gathering and transmission pipelines including four ferc regulated transmission pipeline systems  nine natural gas treating plants  seventeen natural gas processing plants  and trucks  trailers and railcars used for transporting ngls  crude oil and carbon dioxide 
the following tables set forth the operating results of our natural gas segment assets and average daily volumes of our major systems in mmbtu d for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues cost of natural gas operating and administrative depreciation and amortization gain on sale of assets expenses operating income year ended december  average daily volume mmbtu d east texas anadarko north texas south texas utos midla alatenn kpc bamagas other major intrastates total in december  we sold the south texas assets and a sour gas system in east texas which had a combined average daily volume of approximately  mmbtu d 
we recognize revenue upon delivery of natural gas and ngls to customers  when services are rendered  pricing is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we derive revenue in our natural gas segment from the following types of arrangements commodity based arrangements we use several types of contractual arrangements to derive revenues for our natural gas segment 
these arrangements expose us to commodity price risk  which we substantially mitigate with offsetting physical purchases and sales and by the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge open positions 
we will continue to hedge a significant amount of our commodity price risk to support the stability of our cash flows 
refer to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report for more information about our derivative activities 
our commodity based arrangements are categorized as follows percentage of index contracts under these contracts  we purchase raw natural gas at a negotiated discount to an agreed upon index price 
we then resell the natural gas  generally for the index price  keeping the difference as our fee 
percentage of proceeds contracts under the terms of these contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of the natural gas and ngls we process in the form of residue natural gas  ngls  condensate and sulfur  which we then sell at market prices and retain as our fee 
percentage of liquids contracts under these types of contracts  we receive a negotiated percentage of ngls and condensate extracted from natural gas that requires processing  which we then sell at market prices and retain as our fee 
this contract structure is similar to percentage of proceeds arrangements except that we only receive a percentage of the ngls and condensate 
keep whole contracts under these contracts  we gather or purchase raw natural gas from the producer for processing 
a portion of the gathered or purchased natural gas is consumed during processing 
we extract and retain the ngls produced during processing for our own account  which we sell at market prices 
in instances where we purchase raw gas at the wellhead  we also sell for our own account at market prices  the resulting residue gas 
in those instances when we gather and process raw natural gas for the account of the producer  we must return to the producer residue gas with an energy content equivalent to the original raw natural gas we received as measured in british thermal units  or btu 
under the terms of some of these contract structures  we retain a portion of the natural gas and ngls as our fee in exchange for providing these producers with our services 
in order to protect our unitholders from volatility in our cash flows that can result from fluctuations in commodity prices  we enter into derivative financial instruments to effectively fix the sales price of the natural gas and ngls we anticipate receiving under the terms of these contracts 
as a result of entering into these derivative financial instruments  we have largely fixed the amount of cash that we will receive in the future when we sell the processed natural gas and ngls  although the market price of these commodities will continue to fluctuate during that time 
fee based arrangements we also use fee based contract arrangements for services provided by our natural gas assets 
under a fee based contract  we receive a set fee for gathering  treating  processing and transporting raw natural gas and providing other similar services 
these revenues correspond with the volumes and types of services provided and do not depend directly on commodity prices 
revenues of the natural gas segment that are derived from transmission services consist of reservation fees charged for transmission of natural gas on the ferc regulated interstate natural gas transmission pipeline systems  while revenues from intrastate pipelines are generally derived from the bundled sales of natural gas and transmission services 
customers of our ferc regulated natural gas pipeline systems typically pay a reservation fee each month to reserve capacity plus a nominal commodity charge based on actual transmission volumes 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment contributed million of operating income in  an increase of million from the million it contributed in the increase in operating income is primarily attributable to favorable commodity prices which contributed to higher revenue generated by our processing assets in excess of the cost we incur for the natural gas used in processing 
additionally  operating income was higher due to volume increases on each of our three largest systems resulting from additional wellhead supply contracts and the expansion of our transportation and processing capacity 
partially offsetting the benefit provided by favorable volumes and commodity prices are expenses we recorded in of approximately million for ngl purchases and transportation and fractionation charges that relate to prior years we had not previously recorded 
our volumes and operating results are exclusive of the volumes and operating results associated with our december sale of the south texas assets and a sour gas system located on our east texas system 
average daily volumes on our major natural gas systems were up approximately percent in  compared with increases in our volumes for are attributable to our ongoing investments to expand the capacity of our systems and services 
our investments in the following projects that were completed during contributed to the increase in the average daily volumes and operating results on our major natural gas systems the link between our north texas and east texas systems became fully operational during the third quarter of  increasing the utilization of our mmcf d east texas intrastate pipeline that we placed in service in june  construction of our mmcf d henderson natural gas processing facility on our east texas system was completed at the end of the third quarter of and processed volumes of approximately mmcf d  the expansion of our existing zybach processing facility on our anadarko system to a capacity of mmcf d of natural gas from an initial capacity of mmcf d to meet the continuing demands resulting from rapid development in the anadarko basin  and acquisition of an mile pipeline in april that is complimentary to our existing east texas system that provided approximately  mmbtu d of incremental volume 
in addition to the investments we have made to expand our volumes in the areas served by our natural gas assets  the volume and revenue growth is also the result of additional wellhead supply contracts and robust drilling activity in the anadarko basin  bossier trend and barnett shale 
we expect increasing volumes on our major natural gas systems to result from our continuing investments to expand the capacity of our systems 
throughout a majority of  we have experienced a favorable pricing environment with regard to our processing assets and our keep whole processing 
during  ngl and crude oil prices remained high relative to natural gas prices which have declined from the high prices reached in late as a result of this favorable pricing environment  the revenue generated by our processing assets less the cost of natural gas used for processing was approximately million greater than the amounts we realized in this increase includes the contribution to operating income derived from our keep whole processing of million for the year ended december   in excess of the million generated in under this contract structure 
due to the volatility associated with commodity prices  the revenue less cost of natural gas we derive from our processing activities in future periods could be adversely affected if the pricing environment becomes unfavorable  which can occur if the prices for ngls substantially decline and the price of natural gas significantly increases 
we attempt to hedge a majority of our mandatory processing to minimize the effects volatility in commodity prices can have on our processing activities 
a portion of our natural gas segment is exposed to commodity price risks associated with the percentage of proceeds  percentage of liquids  and percentage of index contracts that we negotiate with producers 
under the terms of these contracts  we retain a portion of the natural gas and ngls we process in exchange for providing these producers with our services 
in order to protect our unitholders from the volatility in cash flows that can result from fluctuations in commodity prices  we enter into derivative financial instruments to fix the sales price of the natural gas and ngls we anticipate receiving under the terms of these contracts 
we target to have approximately to percent of our anticipated near term exposure to commodity prices hedged using derivative financial instruments 
as a result of entering into these derivative financial instruments  we have largely fixed the amount of cash that we will pay for natural gas and receive in the future when we sell the processed natural gas and ngls  although the market price of these commodities will continue to fluctuate during that time 
another significant portion of the revenue we receive is derived from fees charged for gathering and treating of natural gas volumes and other related services which are not directly dependent on commodity prices 
operating income of our natural gas segment for the year ended december  includes unrealized non cash  mark to market net losses of million  including million of losses resulting from ineffectiveness of our cash flow hedges and million of gains derived from our derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
in  our operating income was reduced by million of unrealized  non cash  mark to market net losses that we incurred  primarily from derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
the decline in our unrealized derivative fair value losses in is largely due to a decline in the current and forward prices of natural gas and ngls during from the high levels reached in due to hurricanes rita and katrina that caused supply disruptions in the gulf of mexico resulting in a volatile pricing environment 
additionally  our unrealized derivative fair value losses in are lower due to our settlement in december for million of natural gas collars on  mmbtu d of natural gas through that did not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
the settlement of these natural gas collars reduces the quantity of derivatives outstanding that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment in our natural gas segment  effectively reducing the unrealized mark to market adjustments resulting from these derivatives in periods following settlement refer also to item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk and note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report for more information about our derivative activities 
operating and administrative costs of our natural gas segment were million  or percent  greater for than  primarily as a result of increased workforce related costs  maintenance activities and other costs that are mostly variable with volumes 
workforce related costs have increased due to the additional resources and related benefit costs we are charged for the operational  administrative  regulatory and compliance support necessary for our existing assets and the expansion of our natural gas operations 
our general partner charges us the costs associated with employees and related benefits for personnel that are assigned to us or otherwise provide us with managerial and administrative services 
the portion of compensation and related costs we are charged is dependent upon such items as estimated time spent  miles of pipe and headcount 
in addition we have experienced an increase in outside contract labor cost  given the high demand and competitive rates within our industry as a result of continuous pipeline expansions across the areas we serve 
we anticipate that our workforce related costs will continue to increase as we expand our natural gas operations 
the increase in our materials  supplies and other costs along with our repair and maintenance costs are predominantly related to the increase in volumes and expansion of our natural gas systems 
materials  supplies and other costs include chemicals used in our processing activities  materials purchased for repair and maintenance purposes  utility costs to run our plants  pumps and other similar costs that are mostly variable with volumes 
these costs were partially offset by the sale of our south texas assets and a sour gas system located on our east texas system in december  which contributed to the decrease in materials  supplies and other costs compared with repair and maintenance costs include compressor maintenance  downtime for routine and unscheduled maintenance  pipeline integrity costs and other similar items that have increased with the expansion of our existing natural gas systems 
during  we spent approximately million  the majority of which was in the fourth quarter of  on pipeline integrity work in connection with our ongoing pipeline integrity management program in order to comply with regulatory guidance and maintain our existing pipeline integrity standards 
we anticipate these costs will continue to increase as we expand our systems and increase the volumes of natural gas services we provide 
our other operating and administrative costs include rents and leases which primarily relate to compressor rentals  property taxes and other costs 
these additional operating and administrative costs tend to vary in relation to the natural gas volumes moving on our systems or in relation to the expansion of our natural gas operations 
we anticipate these costs will continue to increase as the volumes on our systems increase and we expand our systems 
we expect our operating and administrative costs will continue to increase in future periods as greater volumes of natural gas flow through our systems and we continue to expand our natural gas operations 
our depreciation and amortization expense for the year exceeded the amount reported for by approximately million  primarily as a result of capital projects completed and placed in service during and projects completed in that were only depreciated for a partial year 
the increase in depreciation expense was partially offset by modest extensions of the depreciable lives of our major natural gas systems based on a third party study commissioned by management that was completed in the third quarter of as a result of this study  revised depreciation rates for the anadarko  north texas and east texas systems were implemented effective august  the annual composite rate  which represents the expected remaining service life of these natural gas systems  was reduced from to 
as a result  our depreciation expense was approximately million and million lower for the years ended december  and  respectively  than if these rates had not been reduced 
additionally  we revised our depreciation rates for a portion of our ferc regulated natural gas assets effective july   to reflect a decrease in the remaining service life of these natural gas assets 
depreciation expense was approximately million higher for the year ended december   as a result of this decrease in the expected remaining service life of these assets 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  our natural gas segment contributed million of operating income in  representing an increase of million from the million earned in increased drilling by producers contributed to average daily volume increases of percent in on our major natural gas systems compared with the increase in volumes is primarily the result of additional wellhead supply contracts on our east texas and anadarko systems  as well as the additional volumes on the north texas system associated with the gathering and processing assets we acquired in january drilling activity continues to increase in the anadarko basin  bossier trend and barnett shale areas as evidenced by increasing rig counts and production volumes over the past several years 
additionally  completion of the east texas expansion project in late june contributed modestly to the growth in volumes for the year with continued investment in our systems to expand capacity  we expect our major natural gas systems to benefit from the increase in production volumes expected to result from the continuing increase in drilling activities in the basins we serve 
partially offsetting the positive operating results derived from the increases in gathering  processing and transportation volumes on our natural gas systems were non cash  mark to market net losses of million associated with our derivative transactions and hedging activities 
included in cost of natural gas are non cash losses of million resulting from ineffectiveness associated with our qualified cash flow hedges and million of non cash mark to market losses from derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
the non cash losses primarily result from the significant increases in forward natural gas and ngl prices during the year 
the increase in prices reduces the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments because the fixed price component of these derivatives is significantly less than the market price of natural gas at each of the forward settlement points 
also included in our operating results for the year ended december  is a gain of million we realized in december  when we divested non strategic assets located within our east and south texas systems 
we sold for million in cash  a processing plant and related facilities  and other gathering and processing assets with a carrying value of approximately million 
we incurred selling costs of approximately million 
in connection with this sale  we paid approximately million to settle natural gas hedges associated with the natural gas produced by these assets 
we had previously recorded unrealized losses associated with the natural gas hedges that were realized upon settlement 
a variable element of the natural gas segment s operating income is derived from keep whole processing of natural gas primarily on our anadarko and east texas systems 
this contract structure requires us to process natural gas at times when it may not be economical to do so 
this can happen when natural gas prices are unusually high or ngl prices are unusually low 
during  although natural gas prices were unusually high  they were more than offset by favorable ngl prices 
operating revenue less cost of natural gas derived from keep whole processing for the year was approximately million compared with million in operating and administrative costs of our natural gas segment were million  or percent greater for than  primarily as a result of increased workforce related costs and costs that are variable with volumes 
workforce related costs increased million due to higher pension  medical and other benefits  as well as additional administrative  regulatory and compliance support 
costs that are incremental with volumes  such as chemicals  materials and supplies and direct workforce expenses increased by million 
additionally  the natural gas gathering and processing assets we acquired in january contributed to the cost increases of approximately million 
as well  our maintenance costs increased by approximately million in due to several processing plants that underwent major repairs  one of which was included with the recently divested assets 
our depreciation and amortization expense for the year exceeded the amount reported for by approximately million  primarily as a result of acquisitions and significant capital projects completed and placed in service during the increase in depreciation expense was partially offset by modest extensions of the depreciable lives of our major pipeline systems as a result of a depreciation study completed during the third quarter of based on a third party study commissioned by management  revised depreciation rates for the anadarko  north texas and east texas systems were implemented effective august  the annual composite rate  which represents the expected remaining service life of these natural gas systems  was reduced from to 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  was approximately million lower as a result of the new depreciation rates 
future prospects for natural gas our natural gas assets are located in the gulf coast and mid continent regions of the united states  two of the premier natural gas producing areas 
as a result  there are many opportunities to connect new natural gas supplies either by installing new facilities or acquiring adjacent third party gathering operations 
consolidation with neighboring facilities will extract efficiencies by eliminating costs  for example  by combining redundant facilities  increasing volume  and increasing processing margins 
these opportunities tend to involve modest amounts of capital with attractive rates of return 
although we continue to assess various acquisition and expansion opportunities to pursue our strategy for growth  the market for acquiring energy transportation assets continues to remain active and significant competition persists among prospective acquirers of assets 
while we remain committed to making accretive acquisitions in or near areas where we already operate or have a competitive advantage  we will continue to focus our efforts primarily on development of our existing pipeline systems 
although one of our objectives is to grow our natural gas business through acquisitions  we may and have pursued opportunities to divest any non strategic natural gas assets as conditions warrant 
results of our natural gas gathering and processing business depend upon the drilling activities of natural gas producers in the areas we serve 
during  increased drilling in the areas where our gathering systems are located has generally contributed to our volume growth 
we expect the growth trend in these areas to continue in the future as evidenced by third party reserve studies and the increase in rig counts in the areas served by our systems 
continuing advances in seismic and drilling completion technology  along with robust energy prices  have been key drivers for the higher drilling activity levels in such areas as the tight gas and gas shale locations of the mid continent and east texas 
other advances in drilling technology are enabling producers to more economically extract natural gas from wells and increase well productivity 
one of the prominent areas in which this is occurring is the barnett shale play in north texas 
the barnett shale is a prominent natural gas formation within the fort worth basin  and it is being actively developed 
the formation production has risen from approximately mmcf d to over  mmcf d since  with the drilling of over  wells 
we anticipate that throughput on the north texas system will increase modestly in each of the next several years as a result of barnett shale development 
to accommodate anticipated growth in the region we have commenced construction of two new gas processing plants totaling approximately mmcf d of capacity and related upstream facilities 
these facilities are expected to become operational in the second and fourth quarters of our anadarko system continues to experience considerable growth as a result of the rapid development of the granite wash play in hemphill and wheeler counties in texas 
we are continuing to make progress in increasing processing capacity and field compression in the region from mmcf d at december  to approximately mmcf d to accommodate the volume growth 
we have added approximately mmcf d of processing capacity during and expect to place mmcf d of additional processing capacity as well as field compression in service during producer drilling plans in regional plays  in the areas served by our gas assets  are expected to result in continued production growth 
to accommodate this further growth we initiated construction on several projects during to increase our gathering and treating infrastructure and market access capability 
these projects continue to progress according to schedule and include our expansion and extension of our east texas natural gas system includes construction of a inch diameter intrastate pipeline from bethel  texas to orange county  texas with capacity of approximately mmcf d 
we expect to complete this project in stages throughout the new pipeline will provide service to a number of major industrial companies in southeast texas and will cross a number of interstate pipelines 
we continue to secure additional commitments for capacity on the pipeline 
we currently anticipate the expansion project will cost approximately million 
as part of our east texas expansion project we are adding a mmcf d treating facility to be built near marquez  texas which will be connected to the inch diameter intrastate pipeline via a new inch diameter pipeline 
we expect the plant to be completed and operating in the first quarter of expansion of our sour gas treating capacity on the east texas system will increase the total sulfur capacity in the first half of from tons per day tpd to tpd by early  in order to handle additional sour gas supply and higher concentration levels of hydrogen sulfide hs 
installation of additional processing plants to enable the east texas system to meet the increasingly more stringent pipeline gas quality specifications by late the installation of two processing plants to expand the processing capability of our north texas system  with processing capacities of mmcf d and mmcf d  to be fully operational in early when fully operational in late  the new assets we are constructing will provide additional sources of stable cash flow for us 
we continue to evaluate other projects that could further integrate our major texas centered pipeline systems 
a number of new interstate natural gas transportation pipelines are being constructed that may alter the landscape for interstate transportation of natural gas 
although a majority of our natural gas segment revenues are derived from the gathering  processing and intrastate transportation of natural gas  these newly constructed pipelines could affect the operating results of our existing market based interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines 
conversely  our supply based gathering systems may benefit from enhanced capacity out of our gathering areas 
other matters our bamagas system has agreements to provide transportation of up to  mmbtu d of natural gas for a remaining period of years to two utility plants that are indirectly owned by calpine corporation calpine 
calpine is the sole customer served by the bamagas system 
the bamagas system receives a fixed demand charge of per mmbtu of natural gas for  mmbtu d  regardless of whether the capacity is used 
in december  calpine and many of its subsidiaries  including the subsidiary that owns the two utility plants served by our bamagas system  filed voluntarily petitions to restructure under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
in connection with the bankruptcy filing  calpine has announced receipt of commitments for up to billion of debtor in possession  or dip  financing to allow for the continued operation of its power plants 
our bamagas system is the sole supplier of natural gas to these two utility plants  and we expect the subsidiary that owns these utility plants to continue performing under the terms of our agreement 
due to the recent nature of the bankruptcy filing  we are unable to determine the extent of any losses to which we may be subject as a result of the bankruptcy 
in april  calpine announced its intent to sell approximately of its non core and non strategic power plants  although all of the plants to be sold have not been announced 
calpine has continued to perform under the terms of its agreement with bamagas and we remain confident that any losses we may incur with respect to calpine s bankruptcy will be minimal 
we continue to monitor the calpine bankruptcy proceedings and will recognize any losses that may result when it becomes evident that a loss has been incurred 
marketing the following table sets forth the operating results for the marketing segment assets for the periods presented year ended december  dollars in millions operating revenues cost of natural gas operating and administrative depreciation and amortization expenses operating income loss natural gas purchased and sold by our marketing segment is priced at a published daily or monthly price index 
sales to wholesale customers typically incorporate a premium for managing their transmission and balancing requirements 
higher premiums and associated margins result from transactions that involve smaller volumes or that offer greater service flexibility for wholesale customers 
at their request  we will enter into long term  fixed price purchase or sales contracts with our customers and generally will enter into offsetting hedged positions under the same or similar terms 
marketing pays third party storage facilities and pipelines for the right to store and transport natural gas for various periods of time 
these contracts may be denoted as firm storage  interruptible storage  or parking and lending services 
these various contract structures are used to mitigate risk associated with sales and purchase contracts  and to take advantage of price differential opportunities 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  a majority of the operating income of our marketing segment is derived from selling natural gas received from producers on our natural gas segment pipeline assets to end users of the natural gas 
a majority of the natural gas we purchase is produced in texas markets where we have limited physical access to the primary interstate pipeline delivery points  or hubs such as waha  texas and the houston ship channel 
as a result  our marketing business must use third party pipelines to transport the natural gas to these markets where it can be sold to our customers 
however  physical pipeline constraints often require our marketing business to transport natural gas to alternate market points 
under these circumstances  our marketing segment will sell the purchased gas at a pricing index that is different from the pricing index at which the gas was purchased 
this creates a price exposure that arises from the relative difference in natural gas prices between the contracted index at which the natural gas is purchased and the index under which it is sold  otherwise known as the spread 
the spread can vary significantly due to local supply and demand factors 
wherever possible  this pricing exposure is economically hedged using derivative financial instruments 
however  the structure of these economic hedges often precludes our use of hedge accounting under the requirements of sfas no 
 which can create volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 
to ensure that we have access to primary pipeline delivery points  we often enter into firm transportation agreements on interstate and intrastate pipelines 
to offset the demand charges associated with these firm transportation contracts  we look for market conditions that allow us to lock in the price differential or spread between the pipeline receipt point and pipeline delivery point 
this allows our marketing business to lock in a fixed sales margin inclusive of pipeline demand charges 
we accomplish this by transacting basis swaps between the index where the natural gas is purchased and the index where the natural gas is sold 
by transacting a basis swap between those two indices  we can effectively lock in a margin on the combined natural gas purchase and the natural gas sale  mitigating the demand charges on firm transportation agreements and limiting the partnership s exposure to cash flow volatility that could arise in markets where the firm transportation becomes uneconomic 
however  the structure of these transactions precludes our use of hedge accounting under the requirements of sfas no 
 which can create volatility in the operating results of our marketing segment 
in addition to natural gas basis swaps  we contract for storage to assist with balancing natural gas supply and end use market sales 
in order to mitigate the absolute price differential between the cost of injected natural gas and withdrawn natural gas  as well as storage fees  the injection and withdrawal price differential  or spread  is hedged by buying fixed price swaps for the forecasted injection periods and selling fixed price swaps for the forecasted withdrawal periods 
when the injection and withdrawal spread increases or decreases in value as a result of market price movements  we can earn additional profit through the optimization of those hedges in both the forward and daily markets 
although all of these hedge strategies are sound economic hedging techniques  these types of financial transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under the sfas no 
guidelines 
as such  the non qualified hedges are accounted for on a mark to market basis  and the periodic change in their market value  although non cash  will impact the income statement 
for the year ended december   the operating income of our marketing segment increased million to million  from a loss of million in the significant increase in the operating income of our marketing segment for is primarily due to unrealized  non cash  mark to market net gains of approximately million compared with unrealized mark to market net losses of million for these unrealized mark to market changes are associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
the unrealized  mark to market gains for are the result of a decline in the forward and daily market price of natural gas from the historically high prices experienced in additionally  the basis between the index where the natural gas is purchased and the index where the natural gas is sold has declined in correlation with the decline in the forward market price of natural gas contributing to the unrealized  mark to market net gains for the operating results of our marketing segment for the year ended december   also include non cash charges totaling million attributable to reducing the cost basis of our natural gas inventory to fair market value 
natural gas prices as published by platt s gas daily for henry hub were approximately per mmbtu at december   which had declined to per mmbtu at december  as a result of the decline in the price of natural gas from to  we recorded charges totaling million during to reduce the cost basis of our inventory to fair market value 
partially offsetting this charge are gains of approximately million that we realized upon settlement of derivative financial instruments hedging our natural gas inventory for due to our hedging structures  we expect that a majority of the lower of cost or market inventory charges will be offset by future financial and physical transactions that will settle at the time the natural gas inventory is sold 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  for the year ended december   our marketing segment incurred losses of million  which include non cash mark to market losses of million  compared with earning million of operating income for the non cash  mark to market losses are associated with derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
during  we revised our business strategy for the use of derivative financial instruments associated with the transportation and storage of natural gas to afford us the ability to respond to changing economic conditions 
the flexibility provided by our revised strategy precludes us from continuing the use of hedge accounting with regard to these transactions 
under sfas no 
 if the forecasted transaction is no longer probable of occurring as originally set forth in the hedge documentation  the financial instruments must be marked to market each period with the change in fair market value recorded in earnings 
however  sfas no 
does not allow us to mark to market the change in value of the related underlying physical transaction  and this difference creates earnings volatility when the spreads shift 
we expect these net mark to market losses to be predominantly offset when the related physical transactions are settled refer also to the discussion included in item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note of our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report 
during the third and fourth quarters of  disruptions of natural gas supplies from facilities in the gulf of mexico region caused by hurricanes katrina and rita created greater demand for natural gas production from our onshore natural gas segment pipeline assets  increasing our ability to optimize natural gas supply to areas of strongest demand 
as a result of the hurricanes  unusual volatility in the prices of natural gas created greater spreads on our natural gas volumes 
corporate year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense was million in compared with million in the increase is the result of higher debt balances and weighted average interest rates  partially offset by approximately million of interest capitalized on our construction projects for compared with million capitalized in our weighted average interest rate was approximately for the year ended december   compared with approximately during our debt balances are higher at december  compared with december  as a result of the capital expenditures we have made to expand our existing systems to improve the service capabilities of our assets 
included in other income for the year ended december   is approximately million that we received as settlement for an insurance claim that we filed in connection with an interruption to the operations of our lakehead system resulting from a fire that occurred at suncor s upgrader site in january the partnership is not a taxable entity for us federal income tax purposes and historically has not been a taxable entity for state income tax purposes 
federal and state income taxes on partnership taxable income were both borne directly by the unitholders with no entity level tax on the partnership 
in may  the state of texas enacted substantial changes to its tax structure beginning in by imposing a new tax based upon modified gross revenue 
we determined that this tax is an income tax as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 

our initial accounting for the enactment of this income tax did not materially affect our results of operation  financial condition or cash flows 
although we anticipate texas will make further changes to this tax in that may impact our income tax expense  our income tax expense will be approximately million 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  interest expense was million in compared with million in the increase is the result of higher debt balances and higher weighted average interest rates of approximately for the year ended december   compared with approximately during the increase in our debt balances at december  is due to the gathering and processing assets in north texas we acquired in january  in addition to the capital expenditures we have made to expand our existing systems to improve the service capabilities of our assets 
liquidity and capital resources general we believe that our ability to generate cash flow  in addition to our access to capital  is sufficient to meet the demands of our current and future operating and investment needs 
our primary cash requirements consist of normal operating expenses  capital expenditures for our expansion projects  maintenance capital expenditures  debt service payments  distributions to our partners  acquisitions of new assets and businesses  and payments associated with our derivative transactions 
short term cash requirements  such as operating expenses  maintenance capital expenditures  debt service payments and quarterly distributions to our partners  are expected to be funded by operating cash flows 
margin requirements associated with our derivative transactions are generally supported by letters of credit issued under our credit facility 
we expect to fund long term cash requirements for expansion projects and acquisitions from several sources  including cash flows from operating activities  borrowings under our commercial paper program  our credit facility  and the issuance of additional equity and debt securities 
our ability to complete future debt and equity offerings and the timing of any such offerings will depend on various factors  including prevailing market conditions  interest rates  our financial condition and credit rating at the time 
our current business strategy emphasizes developing and expanding our existing liquids and natural gas businesses with less focus on acquisitions 
the internal growth projects we have planned for our natural gas business see natural gas segment future prospects  coupled with the southern access and alberta clipper projects on our lakehead system see liquids segment future prospects  will require significant expenditures of capital over the next several years 
we expect to fund these expenditures from a balanced combination of additional issuances of partnership capital and long term debt 
our planned internal growth projects will require us to bear the cost of constructing these new assets before we will begin to realize a return on them 
during our construction of these major projects  our ability to increase distributions while funding these construction costs is likely to be limited 
capital resources equity capital execution of our growth strategy and completion of our planned construction projects contemplate our accessing the public and private equity markets to obtain the capital necessary to fund these projects 
during  we raised net proceeds of approximately million of equity in a private transaction for the sale of approximately million of our class c units  representing a new class of our limited partner interests 
we sold the class c units in equal amounts of approximately million units each to our general partner and an institutional investor 
additionally  our general partner contributed approximately million to maintain its two percent general partner interest 
we used the proceeds from this issuance partially to reduce borrowings outstanding under our commercial paper program and to fund a portion of our capital expansion projects 
we invested the remaining amount in short term commercial paper for use in future periods to further reduce our commercial paper borrowings or fund additional expenditures under our capital expansion projects 
the following table presents historical information about our public equity offerings since january issuance date number of class a common units issue offering price per class a common unit net proceeds to the partnership general partner contribution net proceeds including general partner contribution in millions  except per unit amounts we did not issue any class a common units during december november february totals september january totals net of underwriters fees and discounts  commissions and issuance expenses

available credit a significant source of our liquidity is provided by the commercial paper market 
we have a million commercial paper program that is supported by our long term credit facility  which we access primarily to provide temporary financing for our operating activities  capital expenditures and acquisitions  at rates that are generally lower than the rates available under our credit facility 
under the terms of our commercial paper program  we may issue up to million of commercial paper 
at december   we had million in principal amount of commercial paper outstanding and could issue an additional million in principal amount of commercial paper 
our credit facility also provides us with another significant source of liquidity 
in march  we obtained an increase from million to billion in the aggregate commitment available to us under the terms of our credit facility 
the amounts we may borrow under the terms of our credit facility are reduced by the principal amount of our commercial paper issuances and the balance of our letters of credit outstanding 
at december   we had no amounts outstanding under our credit facility and letters of credit totaling million 
we could borrow million under the terms of our credit facility at december   after reducing the billion commitment amount by outstanding letters of credit and the principal balance of commercial paper we have outstanding 
we expect to extend the capacity of our credit facility to approximately to billion in the near term  subject to the approval of the lenders that are party to our credit facility 
at december   our credit facility remains undrawn and available to support our commercial paper program and meet our short term liquidity needs 
indebtedness and other payment obligations the following table presents the components of our outstanding indebtedness december  in millions current maturities of long term debt current portion of first mortgage notes loans from affiliates long term debt commercial paper credit facility first mortgage notes senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due senior notes due unamortized discount total long term debt loans from affiliates debt of enbridge energy  limited partnership  one of our operating subsidiaries 
commercial paper program at december   we had million in principal amount of commercial paper outstanding  with unamortized discount of million  at a weighted average interest rate of  before the effect of our interest rate hedging activities 
we had net borrowings of approximately million during under our commercial paper program which include gross issuances of  million and gross repayments of  million 
at december   we could issue an additional million in principal amount of commercial paper 
credit facility our credit facility  as amended  is a revolving term facility that matures in april in march  we obtained an increase from million to billion in the aggregate commitment available to us 
the amounts we can borrow under the terms of our credit facility are reduced by the principal amount of our commercial paper issuances and the balance of our letters of credit outstanding 
we pay interest on the amounts outstanding at variable rates equal to a base rate or a eurodollar rate as defined in the credit facility 
in the case of eurodollar rate loans  an additional margin is charged which varies depending on our credit rating and the amounts drawn under the facility 
we are also charged a facility fee on the entire amount of the credit facility  regardless of the amount drawn  which also varies depending on our credit rating 
during  we borrowed approximately million to provide short term financing  which we repaid the following business day 
our credit facility contains restrictive covenants that require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of times and a maximum leverage ratio of times for twelve months through december  at which time it decreases to times  thereafter 
at december   our interest coverage ratio was approximately and our leverage ratio was approximately our credit facility also places limitations on the debt that our subsidiaries may incur directly 
accordingly  it is expected that we will provide debt financing to our subsidiaries as necessary 
at december   we had no balances outstanding under our credit facility and could borrow million 
additionally  we have outstanding letters of credit totaling million at december  first mortgage notes the first mortgage notes are collateralized by a first mortgage on substantially all of the property  plant and equipment of the lakehead partnership and are due and payable in equal annual installments of million until their maturity in the notes contain various restrictive covenants applicable to us  and restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  including compliance with certain debt issuance tests 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  we believe these issuance tests will not negatively affect our ability to access the credit markets to finance future expansion projects 
under the first mortgage note agreements  we cannot make cash distributions more frequently than quarterly in an amount not to exceed available cash for the immediately preceding calendar quarter 
if we repay the notes prior to their stated maturities  the first mortgage note agreements provide for the payment of a redemption premium by us 
senior notes in december  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in a public offering  from which we received proceeds of million  after payment of underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses 
we used the proceeds to repay a portion of our outstanding commercial paper and to finance a portion of our capital expansion projects 
we did not issue any senior notes during the year ended  however  during we issued the following senior notes in december  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due and million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in a public offering  from which we received net proceeds of million 
we used the proceeds to repay a portion of the debt outstanding under our bank credit facility 
in january  we issued million in aggregate principal amount of our senior notes due in a public offering  from which we received net proceeds of million

enbridge energy  limited partnership  our operating subsidiary that owns the lakehead system  has million of senior notes  the the olp notes outstanding representing unsecured obligations that are structurally senior to our senior notes 
all of the olp notes pay interest semi annually and have varying maturities and terms as set forth in the table above 
the olp notes do not contain any covenants restricting us from issuing additional indebtedness 
the olp notes are subject to make whole redemption rights and were issued under an indenture the olp indenture containing certain covenants that restrict our ability  with certain exceptions  to sell  convey  transfer  lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  except in accordance with the olp indenture 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  all of our senior notes represent our unsecured obligations that rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
our senior notes are structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities  including trade payables of our subsidiaries and the million of olp notes issued by enbridge energy  limited partnership 
the borrowings under our senior notes are non recourse to our general partner and enbridge management

our senior notes are subject to make whole redemption rights and were issued under an indenture containing certain covenants that restrict our ability  with certain exceptions  to sell  convey  transfer  lease or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets  except in accordance with our indenture agreement 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  loans from general partner and affiliates as of december  and  we had million and million  respectively  in debt outstanding under a note to an affiliate of our general partner 
this note relates to debt we assumed in connection with our acquisition of the midcoast system in october the note matures in december and has cross default provisions that are triggered by events of default under our first mortgage notes or defaults under our credit facility 
the note is subordinate to our credit facility and other senior indebtedness 
for the years ended december  and  we converted interest payable related to this note in the amount of million and million  respectively  into debt by increasing the principal balance of this note 
additionally  in we repaid approximately million in principal amount of this note 
credit ratings the following table reflects the ratings that have been assigned to our debt and the debt of our wholly owned subsidiary  enbridge energy  limited partnership at december  standard poor s moody s dominion bond rating service enbridge energy partners  lp outlook stable negative stable corporate bbb baa bbb commercial paper a p r m medium term notes unsecured debentures bbb baa bbb enbridge energy  limited partnership outlook stable negative n a senior secured bbb baa nr senior unsecured bbb baa nr nr no rating is available moody s recently affirmed our baa rating but revised its outlook to negative 
this reflects moody s view that our financial profile is weaker than those of our similarly rated peers 
however  moody s believes that this weaker financial profile is offset to a degree by our low business risk profile that stems from our highly regulated and or contracted liquids and natural gas systems and our strategy of hedging a significant portion of our commodity exposure 
while our substantial organic growth capital expenditure program will place our financial profile under near term pressure until these projects are commissioned and increase our reliance on the capital markets  moody s believes that completion of our organic growth projects should contribute to a further reduction in our overall business risk profile and that the cash flow generated by these projects as they are commissioned will strengthen our financial profile 
following the successful execution of both the construction and financing of these growth projects over the next to months  an improved rating outlook by moody s is possible 
summary of obligations and commitments the following table summarizes the principal amount of our obligations and commitments at december  future minimum commitments thereafter total in millions long term debt and loans from general partner and affiliates purchase commitments power commitments other operating leases right of way product purchase obligations service contract obligations total represents commitments to purchase materials  primarily pipe from third party suppliers in connection with our expansion projects 
represents commitments to purchase power in connection with our liquids segment 
right of way payments are estimated to be approximately million per year for the remaining life of all pipeline systems  which has been assumed to be years for purposes of calculating the amount of future minimum commitments beyond we have long term product purchase obligations with several third party suppliers to acquire natural gas and ngls at prices approximating market at the time of delivery 
the service contract obligations represent the minimum payment amounts for firm transportation and storage capacity we have reserved on third party pipelines and storage facilities 
cash requirements for future growth capital spending we expect to make significant expenditures during the next three years for the construction of additional natural gas and crude oil transportation infrastructure 
extensive volume growth in the areas served by our east texas system and the resulting constraints in reaching primary market locations necessitates the construction of additional pipeline capacity to transport these volumes to alternate natural gas markets 
anticipated growth in western canadian oil sands production and the need to reach newer markets has prompted the southern access  alberta clipper and related projects associated with our liquid systems 
in  we expect to spend approximately billion on these and other projects with the expectation of realizing additional cash flows as projects are completed and placed in service 
at december   we had approximately million in outstanding purchase commitments attributable to capital projects for the construction of assets that will be recorded as property  plant and equipment during forecasted expenditures we categorize our capital expenditures as either core maintenance or enhancement expenditures 
core maintenance expenditures are those expenditures that are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets and includes the replacement of system components and equipment which is worn  obsolete or completing its useful life 
enhancement expenditures include our capital expansion projects and other projects that improve the service capability of our existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and enable us to respond to governmental regulations and developing industry standards 
we estimate our forecasted expenditures based upon our strategic operating and growth plans  which are also dependent upon our ability to produce or otherwise obtain the capital necessary to accomplish our growth objectives 
the following table sets forth our estimates of capital required for system enhancement and core maintenance expenditures through december  although we anticipate making the expenditures in  these estimates may change due to factors beyond our control  including weather related issues  construction timing  changes in supplier prices or poor economic conditions 
additionally  our estimates may also change as a result of decisions made at a later date to revise the scope of a project 
we anticipate our capital expenditures to approximate the following in millions total forecasted expenditures other system enhancements core maintenance activities southern access expansion east texas expansion and extension clarity major construction projects the following table includes our active major construction projects and additional information regarding our projected cost  actual expenditures through december   the incremental capacity that will become available upon completion of the project and the periods we expect to complete the construction 
the projected amounts included in this table may change due to modifications of the scope of the project  increases in materials and construction costs and other factors that are outside of our direct control

core maintenance capital is also anticipated to increase over that period of time due to growth in our pipeline systems and aging of infrastructure 
we anticipate funding the system enhancement capital expenditures temporarily through the issuance of commercial paper and borrowing under the terms of our credit facility  with permanent debt and equity funding being obtained when appropriate 
core maintenance expenditures are expected to be funded by operating cash flows 
we expect to incur continuing annual capital and operating expenditures for pipeline integrity measures to ensure both regulatory compliance and to maintain the overall integrity of our pipeline systems 
expenditure levels have continued to increase as pipelines age and require higher levels of inspection or maintenance  however  these are viewed to be consistent with industry trends 
acquisitions we will continue to assess various acquisition and expansion opportunities to pursue our strategy for growth 
however  the market for acquiring energy transportation assets is active and competition among prospective acquirers of assets has been significant 
while we remain committed to making accretive acquisitions in or near areas where we already operate or have a competitive advantage  we will continue to focus our efforts on development of our existing pipeline systems 
additionally  we may pursue opportunities to divest of any non strategic assets as conditions warrant 
we expect that the funds needed to achieve growth through acquisitions will be obtained through issuances of commercial paper  borrowings under the terms of our credit facility  term debt and issuances of additional partnership interests 
derivative activities we use derivative financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to mitigate the volatility of our cash flows and manage the purchase and sales prices of our commodities 
based on our risk management policies  all of our derivative financial instruments are employed in connection with an underlying asset  liability and or anticipated transaction and are not entered into with the objective of speculating on commodity prices 
the following table provides summarized information about the timing and expected settlement amounts of our outstanding commodity derivative financial instruments at december  for each of the indicated calendar years notional in millions swaps natural gas ngl crude options calls natural gas options puts natural gas totals notional amounts for natural gas are recorded in millions of british thermal units mmbtu 
notional amounts for ngl and crude are recorded in barrels bbl 
operating activities net cash provided by our operating activities was million in compared with million in improved operating cash flow was primarily the result of the operating income contributions of our processing assets and an increase in the deliveries on our lakehead system 
the remaining changes in cash from operating activities were due to changes in the operating assets and liabilities from declining natural gas prices in  our payment of million to settle interest rate swaps we entered to hedge the interest on the senior notes we issued in december and general timing differences in the collection on and payment of our current accounts 
investing activities we used approximately million more cash in our investing activities during than in the approximate million decrease in expenditures for acquisitions from was more than offset by the million increase in our investments in property  plant and equipment during the increase in our capital expenditures during is directly attributable to our shift in strategy to more organic growth projects to expand the service capability of our existing systems 
also contributing to the increase in the cash used in our investing activities in from are approximately million of proceeds we received in in connection with the sale of gathering and processing assets located on our east and south texas systems 
the proceeds of this sale were partially offset by our payment of million to settle derivatives in connection with the sale of these assets 
we expect that cash flows used in our investing activities will remain at high levels throughout the periods we are performing extensive expansions to our lakehead and east texas systems 
financing activities net cash provided by our financing activities was million in  compared with million in in  we increased the level of our financing activities to obtain permanent capital for financing our organic growth projects 
in august  we issued approximately million of our class c units to our general partner and an institutional investor at per unit for proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  our general partner contributed an additional million to maintain its two percent general partner interest 
also in december  we issued million in principal amount of our senior notes and received proceeds of approximately million after payment of underwriting commissions and issuance costs 
also contributing to our financing activities was approximately million of net borrowings under our commercial paper program which include gross issuances of  million and gross repayments of  million 
these increases in sources of cash flow from financing activities are partially offset by a greater amount of distributions to our partners resulting from more outstanding limited partner units and payments we made on the first mortgage notes and on an affiliate loan 
during  cash distributions to partners increased to million from million in due to an increase in the number of units outstanding  and an increase in the general partner incentive distributions  as a result of the increased cash distributions to our common unitholders 
cash distributions we make quarterly distributions to our general partner and the holders of our limited partner units in an amount equal to our available cash 
as defined in our partnership agreement  available cash represents for any calendar quarter  the sum of all of our cash receipts plus net reductions to reserves less all of our cash disbursements and net changes to reserves 
we retain reserves to provide for the proper conduct of our business  to stabilize distributions to our unitholders and the general partner and  as necessary  to comply with the terms of any of our agreements or obligations 
enbridge management  as the delegate of the general partner under a delegation of control agreement  computes the amount of our available cash 
enbridge management  as owner of our i units  does not receive distributions in cash 
instead  each time that we make a cash distribution to the general partner and the holders of our class a and class b common units  the number of i units owned by enbridge management and the percentage of total units in us owned by enbridge management increases automatically under the provisions of our partnership agreement with the result that the number of i units owned by enbridge management will equal the sum of enbridge management s shares that are then outstanding 
the amount of this increase in i units is determined by dividing the cash amount distributed per limited partner unit by the average price of one of enbridge management s listed shares on the nyse for the trading day period immediately preceding the ex dividend date for enbridge management s shares multiplied by the number of shares outstanding on the record date 
the cash equivalent amount of the additional i units is treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to be made to the general partner 
until august   in lieu of cash distributions  the holders of our class c units will receive quarterly distributions of additional class c units with a value equal to the quarterly cash distributions we pay to the holders of our class a and class b common units  which we collectively refer to as common units 
the number of additional class c units we will issue is determined by dividing the quarterly cash distribution per unit we pay on our common units by the average market price of a class a common unit as listed on the new york stock exchange for the trading day period immediately preceding the ex dividend date for our class a common units multiplied by the number of class c units outstanding on the record date 
as a result  the number of class c units and the percentage of our total units owned by holders of the class c units will increase automatically under the provisions of our partnership agreement 
the cash equivalent amount of the additional class c units is treated as if it had actually been distributed for purposes of determining the distributions to be made to the general partner 
after august   the holders of our class c units will receive quarterly cash distributions equal to those paid to the holders of our common units 
subject to the approval of holders of our outstanding units in accordance with the then existing requirements of the principal national securities exchange on which the class a common units are listed  the class c units will convert into class a common units on a one for one basis 
if our unitholders do not approve the conversion  the holders of our class c units will receive quarterly cash distributions equal to percent of those paid to the holders of our common units 
prior to conversion  holders of our class c units will not be entitled to receive any quarterly cash distribution until the holders of our common units have received a minimum quarterly cash distribution of per common unit 
for purposes of calculating the sum of all distributions of available cash  the cash equivalent amount of the additional i units and class c units that are issued when a distribution of cash is made to the general partner and owners of common units is treated as distribution of available cash  even though the i unit holder and holders of our class c units will not receive cash 
we retain the cash for use in our operations to finance a portion of our capital expansion projects 
during  we distributed a total of  i units through quarterly distributions to enbridge management  compared with  in additionally  we distributed a total of  class c units to the holders of our class c units 
we retained million in related to the i unit and class c unit distributions  compared with million in we expect our annual cash distribution rate for fiscal year to remain consistent with the declared annual distribution per unit rate of for the years ended december  and we expect that all cash distributions will be paid out of operating cash flows over the long term  however  from time to time  we may temporarily borrow under our credit facility or issue additional commercial paper for the purpose of paying cash distributions until the full impact of assets being developed on operations is realized 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements 
subsequent events distribution to partners on january   the board of directors of enbridge management declared a distribution payable to our partners on february  the distribution was paid to unitholders of record as of february   of our available cash of million at december   or per limited partner unit 
of this distribution  million was paid in cash  million was distributed in i units to our i unitholder  million was distributed in class c units to the holders of our class c units and million was retained from the general partner in respect of the i unit and class c unit distributions to maintain its two percent general partner interest 
line leaks in january  we detected a leak on line of our lakehead system  near the owen  wisconsin pump station 
we immediately shut the pipeline down and dispatched emergency response crews to oversee containment  cleanup and repair of the pipeline at an estimated cost of less than million 
we estimate the spill to approximate  barrels 
we completed excavation and repairs and returned the line to service within two days 
we have applied pressure restrictions to the line as we work with federal and state environmental and pipeline safety regulators to investigate the cause of the rupture 
such pressure restrictions are not anticipated to have a material impact on system throughput 
we have the potential of incurring additional expenditures to remediate any condition on the line that is determined to have caused the rupture 
in february  a contractor undertaking work in rusk county  wisconsin on the enbridge southern lights project punctured the adjacent line pipeline  resulting in a release of crude oil estimated at  barrels 
as the spill was largely contained within the ditch used for construction  environmental impact was minimized 
impact to customers was minimized as the line was repaired and returned to service in less than two days 
we are investigating this incident and will record costs associated with the repair and cleanup as such amounts are determined 
critical accounting policies and estimates our selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as our business activities have evolved and as new accounting pronouncements have been issued 
accounting decisions generally involve an interpretation of existing accounting principles and the use of judgment in applying those principles to the specific circumstances existing in our business 
we make every effort to comply with all applicable accounting principles and believe the proper implementation and consistent application of these principles is critical 
however  not all situations we encounter are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in such cases  we must use our best judgment to implement accounting policies that clearly and accurately present the substance of these situations 
we accomplish this by analyzing similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them and consulting with experts about the appropriate interpretation and application of the accounting literature to these situations 
in addition to the above  certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
these estimates affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures with respect to contingent assets and liabilities 
the basis for our estimates is historical experience  consultation with experts and other sources we believe to be reliable 
while we believe our estimates are appropriate  actual results can and often do differ from these estimates 
any effect on our business  financial position  results of operations and cash flows resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
we believe our critical accounting policies and estimates discussed in the following paragraphs address the more significant judgments and estimates we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
each of these areas involves complex situations and a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing accounting literature or in the development of estimates that affect our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies and estimates related to the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent liabilities with the audit  finance risk committee of enbridge management s board of directors 
revenue recognition and the estimation of revenues and cost of natural gas in general  we recognize revenue when delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  pricing is determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for our natural gas and marketing businesses  we must estimate our current month revenue and cost of natural gas to permit the timely preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we generally cannot compile actual billing information nor obtain actual vendor invoices within a timeframe that would permit the recording of this actual data prior to preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  we record an estimate each month for our operating revenues and cost of natural gas based on the best available volume and price data for natural gas delivered and received  along with a true up of the prior month s estimate to equal the prior month s actual data 
as a result  there is one month of estimated data recorded in our operating revenues and cost of natural gas for each period reported 
we believe that the assumptions underlying these estimates will not be significantly different from the actual amounts due to the routine nature of these estimates and the stability of our processes 
capitalization policies  depreciation methods and impairment of property  plant and equipment we capitalize expenditures related to property  plant and equipment  subject to a minimum rule  that have a useful life greater than one year for assets purchased or constructed  existing assets that are replaced  improved  or the useful lives have been extended  or all land  regardless of cost 
acquisitions of new assets  additions  replacements and improvements other than land costing less than the minimum rule in addition to maintenance and repair costs are expensed as incurred 
during construction  we capitalize direct costs  such as labor and materials  and other costs  such as direct overhead and interest at our weighted average cost of debt  and  in our regulated businesses that apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  or sfas no 
 an equity return component 
we categorize our capital expenditures as either core maintenance or enhancement expenditures 
core maintenance expenditures are necessary to maintain the service capability of our existing assets and include the replacement of system components and equipment that are worn  obsolete or near the end of their useful lives 
examples of core maintenance expenditures include valve automation programs  cathodic protection  zero hour compression overhauls and electrical switchgear replacement programs 
enhancement expenditures improve the service capability of our existing assets  extend asset useful lives  increase capacities from existing levels  reduce costs or enhance revenues  and enable us to respond to governmental regulations and developing industry standards 
examples of enhancement expenditures include costs associated with installation of seals  liners and other equipment to reduce the risk of environmental contamination from crude oil storage tanks  costs of sleeving a major segment of the pipeline system following an integrity tool run  natural gas or crude oil well connects  natural gas plants and pipeline construction and expansion 
regulatory guidance issued by the ferc requires us to expense certain costs associated with implementing the pipeline integrity management requirements of the us department of transportation s office of pipeline safety 
under this guidance  beginning in january  costs to prepare a plan to implement the program  identify high consequence areas  develop and maintain a record keeping system and inspect  test and report on the condition of affected pipeline segments to determine the need for repairs or replacements  are required to be expensed 
we adopted this guidance prospectively in january for all our pipeline systems 
costs of modifying pipelines to permit in line inspections  certain costs associated with developing or enhancing computer software and costs associated with remedial mitigation actions to correct an identified condition continue to be capitalized 
we have historically capitalized initial in line inspection programs  crack detection tool runs and hydrostatic testing costs conducted for the purposes of detecting manufacturing or construction defects 
beginning january  costs of this nature are expensed as incurred which is consistent with industry practice and the regulatory guidance issued by the ferc 
however  we continue to capitalize initial construction hydrostatic testing cost and subsequent hydrostatic testing programs conducted for the purpose of increasing pipeline capacity in accordance with our capitalization policies 
also capitalized are certain costs such as sleeving or recoating existing pipelines  unless the expenditures are incurred as a single event and not part of a major program  in which case we expense these costs as incurred 
our adoption of the regulatory guidance did not significantly affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
we record property  plant and equipment at its original cost  which we depreciate on a straight line basis over the lesser of their estimated useful lives or the estimated remaining lives of the crude oil or natural gas production in the basins the assets serve 
our determination of the useful lives of property  plant and equipment requires us to make various assumptions  including the supply of and demand for hydrocarbons in the markets served by our assets  normal wear and tear of the facilities  and the extent and frequency of maintenance programs 
we routinely utilize consultants and other experts to assist us in assessing the remaining lives of the crude oil or natural gas production in the basins we serve 
we record depreciation using the group method of depreciation which is commonly used by pipelines  utilities and similar entities 
under the group method  for all segments  upon the disposition of property  plant and equipment  the cost less net proceeds is normally charged to accumulated depreciation and no gain or loss on disposal is recognized 
however  when a separately identifiable group of assets  such as a stand alone pipeline system is sold  we will recognize a gain or loss in our consolidated statements of income for the difference between the cash received and the net book value of the assets sold 
changes in any of our assumptions may alter the rate at which we recognize depreciation in our consolidated financial statements 
at regular intervals  we retain the services of independent consultants to assist us with assessing the reasonableness of the useful lives we have established for the property  plant and equipment of our major systems 
based on the results of these regular assessments we may make modifications to the assumptions we use to determine our depreciation rates 
we evaluate the recoverability of our property  plant and equipment when events or circumstances such as economic obsolescence  the business climate  legal and other factors indicate we may not recover the carrying amount of the assets 
we continually monitor our businesses and the market and business environments to identify indicators that may suggest an asset may not be recoverable 
we evaluate the asset for recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be derived from operating the asset 
these cash flow estimates require us to make projections and assumptions for many years into the future for pricing  demand  competition  operating cost and other factors 
we recognize an impairment loss when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value as determined by quoted market prices in active markets or present value techniques if quotes are unavailable 
the determination of the fair value using present value techniques requires us to make projections and assumptions regarding the probability of a range of outcomes and the rates of interest used in the present value calculations 
any changes we make to these projections and assumptions could result in significant revisions to our evaluation of recoverability of our property  plant and equipment and the recognition of an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income 
assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangibles goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in a business combination 
goodwill is not amortized  but is tested for impairment annually based on the carrying values as of the end of the second quarter  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise that suggest the carrying value of goodwill may not be recovered 
impairment occurs when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
at the time we determine that impairment has occurred  the carrying value of the goodwill is written down to its fair value 
to estimate the fair value of the reporting units  we make estimates and judgments about future cash flows  as well as revenue  cost of sales  operating expenses  capital expenditures and net working capital based on assumptions that are consistent with our most recent five year plan  which we use to manage the business 
preparation of forecast information for use in our five year plan involves significant judgment 
actual results can  and often do  differ from the projections and assumptions we make in preparing these forecasts 
these changes can have a negative impact on our estimates of impairment  which could result in charges to income 
in addition  further changes in the economic and business environment can affect our original and ongoing assessments of potential impairment 
other intangible assets consist of customer contracts for the purchase and sale of natural gas  and natural gas supply opportunities  which we amortize on a straight line basis over the weighted average useful life of the underlying assets  which is the period over which the asset is expected to contribute directly or indirectly to our future cash flows 
we evaluate the carrying value of the intangible assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
in assessing the recoverability of intangibles  we compare the carrying value to the undiscounted future cash flows the intangibles are expected to generate 
if the total of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the intangibles  the intangibles are written down to their fair value 
if there are changes to any of our estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ 
asset retirement obligations we record a liability for the fair value of our asset retirement obligations  or aro  on a discounted basis  in the period in which the liability is incurred 
typically we record an aro at the time the assets are installed or acquired  if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
in connection with establishing an aro  we capitalize the costs as part of the carrying value of the related assets 
we recognize an ongoing expense for the interest component of the liability as part of depreciation expense resulting from changes in the value of the aro due to the passage of time 
we depreciate the initial capitalized costs over the useful lives of the related assets 
we extinguish the liabilities for asset retirement obligations when assets are taken out of service or otherwise abandoned 
the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin require us to recognize a liability and related asset  consistent with sfas no 
 for the fair value of conditional asset retirement obligations that we can reasonably estimate 
fin also provides specific guidance regarding when an asset retirement obligation is reasonably estimable including when sufficient information is available to apply an expected present value technique 
our implementation of fin did not have a material impact effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we have legal obligations requiring us to decommission our offshore pipeline systems at retirement 
in certain rate jurisdictions  we are permitted to include annual charges for removal costs in the regulated cost of service rates we charge our customers 
additionally  legal obligations exist for a minority of our onshore right of way agreements due to requirements or landowner options to compel us to remove the pipe at final abandonment 
sufficient data exists with certain onshore pipeline systems to reasonably estimate an abandonment retirement obligation cost 
however  in some cases  there is insufficient information to reasonably determine the timing and or method of settlement for estimating the fair value of the asset retirement obligation 
in these cases  the asset retirement obligation cost is considered indeterminate because there is no data or information that can be derived from past practice  industry practice  management s intent  or the asset s estimated economic life 
useful lives of most pipeline systems are primarily derived from available supply resources and the ultimate consumption of those resources by end users 
variables can affect the remaining lives of the assets which preclude us from making a reasonable estimate of the aro 
indeterminate aro costs will be recognized in the period in which sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate potential settlement dates and methods 
derivative financial instruments our net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in interest rates and commodity prices of natural gas  ngls  condensate and fractionation margins the relative price differential between ngl sales and the offsetting natural gas purchases 
to reduce the volatility of our cash flows  we use derivative financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to manage the purchase and sales prices of the commodities and fix the interest rate on our variable rate debt 
the accounting treatment for our derivative financial instruments is determined by the guidance of sfas no 
and is dependent on each instrument s intended use  how it is designated and the extent to which the derivative financial instrument is effective in reducing the risk that it is intended to hedge 
to qualify for hedge accounting  very specific requirements must be met in terms of hedge structure  hedge objective and hedge documentation 
derivative financial instruments qualifying for hedge accounting treatment that we use can generally be divided into two categories cash flow hedges  or fair value hedges 
we enter into cash flow hedges to reduce the variability in cash flows related to forecasted transactions 
we enter into fair value hedges to reduce the risk of changes in the value of a recognized asset or liability 
cash flow and fair value hedges are considered highly effective if they are able to substantially offset ie  more than percent the changes in cash flow or fair value of the risk that is being hedged 
the extent to which a derivative financial instrument designated as a hedge does not offset the changes in cash flow or fair value of the risk being hedged is considered ineffective 
at inception and on an ongoing basis we assess whether the derivative financial instruments we use in our hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of the hedged items 
all of our derivative financial instruments are recorded in our consolidated financial statements at fair market value as current and long term assets or liabilities on a net basis by counterparty and are adjusted each period for changes in the fair market value 
the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or receive to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date  taking into account the current unrealized losses or gains on open contracts 
we use external market quotes and indices to value substantially all of the financial instruments we utilize 
derivative financial instruments that we designate and qualify as cash flow or fair value hedges under the requirements of sfas no 
 receive hedge accounting treatment for the effective portion of the derivative financial instrument 
under hedge accounting  any unrealized gain or loss in fair market value of the effective portion of a derivative financial instrument designated as a cash flow hedge is recorded as an asset or liability with an offset deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  a component of partners capital  until the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases and sales are included in cost of natural gas and cash flow hedges of forecasted interest payments are included in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income in the period the hedged transaction occurs 
under hedge accounting  the realized and unrealized gain or loss in the fair market value of a derivative financial instrument designated as a fair value hedge is recorded as an asset or a liability with the offset recorded in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of natural gas for fair value hedges of our commodities and as a component of interest expense for fair value hedges of our indebtedness both of which are offset by the changes in the fair market value of the underlying hedged item 
under the guidance of sfas no 
 the changes in fair market value  both realized and unrealized gains and losses  of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting  are not designated as hedges and are ineffective  are recognized each period in our consolidated statements of income 
these changes in fair market value are recognized as a component of cost of natural gas for our commodity derivative financial instruments and as a component of interest expense for derivative financial instruments of our interest rates 
we refer to the accounting treatment for derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting as mark to market accounting 
our preference  whenever possible  is for our derivative financial instruments to receive hedge accounting treatment to mitigate the non cash earnings volatility that arises under mark to market accounting treatment 
our cash flow is only affected to the extent the actual derivative contract is settled by making or receiving a payment to from the counterparty  or by making or receiving a payment for entering into a contract that exactly offsets the original derivative contract 
typically  a derivative contract is settled when the physical transaction that underlies the derivative financial instrument occurs 
gains and losses that we have deferred in aoci related to cash flow hedges for which hedge accounting has been discontinued  remain in aoci until the underlying physical transaction occurs unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
one of the primary factors that can affect our operating results each period is the price assumptions we use to value our derivative financial instruments 
to the extent that these derivative financial instruments are ineffective or do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the requirements of sfas no 
 they are accounted for using the mark to market method of accounting and any change in the fair market value is reflected in our consolidated statements of income as a component of cost of natural gas or interest expense  depending on whether the derivative financial instrument relates to a commodity or interest rate 
we use published market price information where available  or quotations from otc market makers to find executable bids and offers 
the valuations also reflect the potential impact of liquidating our position in an orderly manner over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions  modeling risk  credit risk of our counterparties and operational risk 
the amounts we report in our consolidated financial statements change quarterly as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
commitments  contingencies and environmental liabilities we accrue reserves for contingent liabilities  including environmental remediation and clean up costs  when our assessments indicate that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and an amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the liabilities are based on currently available facts  existing technology and presently enacted laws and regulations taking into consideration the likely effects of inflation and other factors  and include estimates of associated legal costs 
these estimates also consider prior experience remediating contaminated sites  other companies clean up experience and data released by government organizations 
our estimates are subject to revision in future periods based on actual costs or new circumstances and any revisions are reflected in our earnings in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
we evaluate recoveries from insurance coverage separately from our liability and  when recovery is reasonably assured  we record and report an asset separately from the associated liability in our financial statements 
new environmental developments  such as increasingly strict environmental laws and regulations and new claims for damages to property  employees  other persons and the environment resulting from our current or past operations  could result in substantial cost and future liabilities 
we recognize liabilities for other contingencies when we have an exposure that  when fully analyzed  indicates it is both probable that an asset has been impaired or that a liability has been incurred and the amount of impairment or loss can be reasonably estimated 
both internal and external legal counsel evaluate our potential exposure to adverse outcomes 
when a range of probable loss can be estimated  we accrue the most likely amount  or at least the minimum of the range of probable loss 
to the extent that actual outcomes differ from our estimates  or additional facts and circumstances cause us to review our estimates  income may be affected 
crude oil over short balance and crude oil measurement gains losses crude oil over short balance and crude oil measurement gains losses are inherent in the transportation of crude oil due to evaporation  measurement differences and blending of commodities in transit in addition to other factors 
we estimate our crude oil measurement gains losses and our crude oil over short balance based on mathematical calculations and physical measurements  which include assumptions about the type of crude oil  its market value  normal physical losses due to evaporation and capacity limitations of the system 
a material change in these assumptions may result in a change to the carrying value of our crude oil over short balance or revision of our crude oil measurement gain loss estimates 
we include the crude oil measurement gains losses in our operating and administrative expenses on our consolidated statements of income and the crude oil over short balance in accounts payable and other in the consolidated statements of financial position if the balance is a liability and in inventory if the balance is in an asset position 
operational balancing agreements and natural gas imbalances we record payables and receivables associated with our natural gas pipeline operational balancing agreements and natural gas imbalances monthly when a customer delivers more or less natural gas into our pipelines than they remove 
these balances are either settled on a cash basis or are carried by the pipelines and shippers on an in kind basis 
we primarily estimate the value of the imbalances at month end spot prices based on published third party indices for the locations where the imbalances are derived using the best available third party and internal volume information 
if there is a change to these estimates and assumptions  actual results may differ 
recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted fair value measurements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb statement no

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we utilize both fixed and variable interest rate debt  and are exposed to market risk resulting from the variable interest rates on our credit facility and the frequent changes in interest rates when we re issue maturing commercial paper 
to the extent that we frequently issue and re issue commercial paper at short term interest rates and have amounts drawn under our credit facilities at floating rates of interest  our earnings and cash flows are exposed to changes in interest rates 
this exposure is managed through periodically refinancing commercial paper and floating rate bank debt with long term fixed rate debt and through the use of interest rate derivative financial instruments including futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics 
we do not have any material exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates as virtually all of our revenues and expenses are denominated in us dollars 
to the extent that a material foreign exchange exposure arises  we intend to hedge such exposure using derivative financial instruments

our interest rate risk exposure does not exist within any of our segments  but exists at the corporate level where our variable rate debt obligations are issued 
to mitigate the volatility of our cash flows  we use derivative financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to manage the risks associated with market fluctuations in interest rates 
based on our risk management policies  all of our derivative financial instruments are employed in connection with an underlying asset  liability and or forecasted transaction and are not entered into with the objective of speculating on interest rates 
the table below provides information about our derivative financial instruments that we use to hedge the interest payments on our variable rate debt obligations which are sensitive to changes in interest rates and to lock in the interest rate on anticipated issuances of debt in the future 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional amounts  the rates charged on the underlying notional and weighted average interest rates paid by expected maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the contract

our floating to fixed rate interest rate swaps maturing in qualify for hedge accounting treatment as set forth in sfas no 
and have been designated cash flow hedges of interest payments on million of our variable rate indebtedness 
similarly  our treasury locks maturing in qualify for hedge accounting treatment pursuant to the requirements of sfas no 
and have been designated as cash flow hedges of future interest payments on the first million of an anticipated debt issuance 
additionally  our interest rate collars qualify for hedge accounting treatment as per sfas no 
and have been designated as cash flow hedges of interest payments on million of our variable rate indebtedness 
as such  the fair value of these derivative financial instruments is recorded as assets or liabilities on our consolidated statements of financial position with the changes in fair value recorded as corresponding increases or decreases in aoci 
the floating to fixed rate and fixed to floating rate interest rate swaps maturing in have not been designated as cash flow or fair value hedges under sfas no 
and  as a result  changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments are recorded in earnings as an increase or decrease in interest expense 
commodity price risk our net income and cash flows are subject to volatility stemming from changes in commodity prices of natural gas  ngls  condensate and fractionation margins the relative price differential between ngl sales and the offsetting natural gas purchases 
our exposure to commodity price risk exists within our natural gas and marketing segments 
to mitigate the volatility of our cash flows  we use derivative financial instruments ie  futures  forwards  swaps  options and other financial instruments with similar characteristics to manage the risks associated with market fluctuations in commodity prices 
based on our risk management policies  all of our derivative financial instruments are employed in connection with an underlying asset  liability and or forecasted transaction and are not entered into with the objective of speculating on commodity prices

fair values are presented in millions of dollars 
accounting treatment all derivative financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated financial statements at fair market value and are adjusted each period for changes in the fair market value mark to market 
the fair market value of these derivative financial instruments reflects the estimated amounts that we would pay or receive  other than in a forced or liquidation sale  to terminate or close the contracts at the reporting date  taking into account the current unrealized losses or gains on open contracts 
we use actively traded external market quotes and indices to value substantially all of the financial instruments we utilize 
under the guidance of sfas no 
 if a derivative financial instrument does not qualify as a hedge  or is not designated as a hedge  the derivative is adjusted to its fair market value  or marked to market  each period with the increases and decreases in fair value recorded in our consolidated statements of income as increases and decreases in cost of natural gas for our commodity based derivatives and interest expense for our interest rate derivatives 
cash flow is only impacted to the extent the actual derivative contract is settled by making or receiving a payment to or from the counterparty or by making or receiving a payment for entering into a contract that exactly offsets the original derivative contract 
typically  we settle our derivative contracts when the physical transaction that underlies the derivative financial instrument occurs 
if a derivative financial instrument qualifies and is designated as a cash flow hedge  a hedge of a forecasted transaction or future cash flows  any unrealized mark to market gain or loss is deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income aoci  a component of partners capital  until the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
to the extent that the hedge instrument is effective in offsetting the transaction being hedged  there is no impact to the income statement 
at inception and on a quarterly basis  we formally assess whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
any ineffective portion of a cash flow hedge s change in fair market value is recognized each period in earnings 
realized gains and losses on derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges and qualify for hedge accounting are included in cost of natural gas for commodity hedges and interest expense for interest rate hedges in the period the hedged transaction occurs 
gains and losses deferred in aoci related to cash flow hedges  for which hedge accounting has been discontinued  remain in aoci until the underlying physical transaction occurs unless it is probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur by the end of the originally specified time period  or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
generally  our preference is for our derivative financial instruments to receive hedge accounting treatment whenever possible  to mitigate the non cash earnings volatility that arises under mark to market accounting treatment 
to qualify for cash flow hedge accounting as set forth in sfas no 
 very specific requirements must be met in terms of hedge structure  hedge objective and hedge documentation 
if a derivative financial instrument is designated and qualifies as a fair value hedge of the change in fair market value of an underlying asset or liability  the gain or loss resulting from the change in fair market value of the derivative financial instrument is recorded in earnings adjusted by the gain or loss resulting from the change in fair market value of the underlying asset or liability 
any ineffective portion of a fair value hedge s change in fair market value will be recorded in earnings as the amount that is not offset by the gain or loss on the change in fair market value of the underlying asset or liability 
we include the gains and losses associated with derivative financial instruments designated and qualifying as fair value hedges of our debt obligations in interest expense on our consolidated statements of income 
similar to derivative financial instruments designated as cash flow hedges  very specific requirements must be met in terms of hedge structure  hedge objective and hedge documentation 
non qualified hedges many of our derivative financial instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under the specific requirements of sfas no 
however  we have four primary transaction types associated with our commodity derivative financial instruments where the hedge structure does not meet the requirements to apply hedge accounting 
as a result  these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
and are referred to as non qualified 
non qualified derivative financial instruments are marked to market each period with the change in fair value  representing unrealized gains and losses  included in cost of natural gas in our consolidated statements of income 
these mark to market adjustments produce a degree of earnings volatility that can often be significant from period to period  but have no cash flow impact relative to changes in market prices 
the cash flow impact occurs when the underlying physical transaction takes place in the future and when the associated financial instrument contract settlement is made 
the four primary transaction types that do not qualify for hedge accounting are as follows transportation in our marketing segment  when we transport natural gas from one location to another the pricing index used for natural gas sales is usually different from the pricing index used for natural gas purchases  which exposes us to market price risk relative to changes in those two indices 
by entering into a basis swap  where we exchange one pricing index for another  we can effectively lock in the margin  representing the difference between the sales price and the purchase price  on the combined natural gas purchase and natural gas sale  removing any market price risk on the physical transactions 
although this represents a sound economic hedging strategy  the derivative financial instruments ie  the basis swaps we use to manage the commodity price risk associated with these transportation contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
 since only the future margin has been fixed and not the future cash flow 
as a result  these derivative financial instruments are marked to market 
storage in our marketing segment  we use derivative financial instruments ie  natural gas swaps to hedge the relative difference between the injection price paid to purchase and store natural gas and the withdrawal price at which the natural gas is sold from storage 
the intent of these derivative financial instruments is to lock in the margin  representing the difference between the price paid for the natural gas injected and the price received upon withdrawal of the gas from storage in a future period 
we do not pursue cash flow hedge accounting treatment for these storage transactions since the underlying forecasted injection or withdrawal of natural gas may not occur in the period as originally forecast 
this can occur because we have the flexibility to make changes in the underlying injection or withdrawal schedule  given changes in market conditions 
in addition  since the physical natural gas is recorded at the lower of cost or market  timing differences can result when the derivative financial instrument is settled in a period that is different from when the physical natural gas is sold from storage 
as a result  derivative financial instruments associated with our natural gas storage activities can create volatility in our earnings 
natural gas collars in our natural gas segment  we had previously entered into natural gas collars to hedge the sales price of natural gas 
the natural gas collars were based on a nymex price  while the physical gas sales were based on a different index 
to better align the index of the natural gas collars with the index of the underlying sales  we de designated the original cash flow hedging relationship with the intent of contemporaneously re designating the natural gas collars as hedges of forecasted physical natural gas sales with a nymex pricing index 
however  because the fair value of these derivative instruments was a liability to us at re designation  they are considered net written options under sfas no 
and do not qualify for hedge accounting 
these derivatives are being marked to market  with the changes in fair value from the date of de designation recorded to earnings each period 
as a result  our operating income will be subject to greater volatility due to movements in the prices of natural gas until the underlying long term transactions are settled 
optional natural gas processing volumes in our natural gas segment we use derivative financial instruments to hedge the volumes of ngls produced from our natural gas processing facilities 
our natural gas contracts allow us the option of processing natural gas when it is economical  and ceasing to do so when processing becomes uneconomic 
we have entered into derivative financial instruments to fix the sales price of a portion of the ngls that we produce at our discretion and to fix the associated purchases of natural gas required for processing 
we will designate derivative financial instruments associated with ngls we produce at our discretion as cash flow hedges when the processing of natural gas is probable of occurrence 
however  we are precluded from designating the derivative financial instruments entered to manage the respective commodity price risk when we are unable to accurately forecast the ngls to be processed at our discretion 
as a result  our operating income will be subject to increased volatility due to fluctuations in ngl prices until the underlying transactions are settled or offset 
in each of the instances described above  the underlying physical purchase  storage and sale of natural gas and ngls are accounted for on a historical cost or market basis rather than on the mark to market basis we utilize for the derivative financial instruments employed to mitigate the commodity price risk associated with our storage and transportation assets 
this difference in accounting ie  the derivative financial instruments are recorded at fair market value while the physical transactions are recorded at historical cost can and has resulted in volatility in our reported net income  even though the economic margin is essentially unchanged from the date the transactions were consummated 
discontinuance of hedge accounting in  we discontinued application of hedge accounting in connection with some of our derivative financial instruments designated as hedges of forecasted sales and purchases of natural gas 
we discontinued application of hedge accounting when we determined it was no longer probable that the originally forecasted purchases and sales of natural gas would occur by the end of the originally specified time period  or within an additional two month period of time thereafter 
as discussed above  this can occur because we have the flexibility to make changes to the underlying delivery locations for our transportation assets and to the underlying injection or withdrawal schedule for our storage assets  given changes in market conditions 
one of the key criteria to achieve hedge accounting under sfas no 
is that the forecasted transaction be probable of occurring as originally set forth in the hedge documentation 
as a result  in  we recognized previously deferred unrealized losses in our marketing segment of approximately million from the discontinuance of hedge accounting 
in doing so  we reclassified the million to cost of natural gas on our consolidated statements of income from aoci 
going forward  the derivative financial instruments for which hedge accounting has been discontinued are considered to be non qualified under sfas no 
 and must be marked to market each period  with the increases and decreases in fair value recorded as increases and decreases in earnings 
also included in the loss from discontinuance are approximately million of net mark to market losses that relate to hedge positions that were closed out in the following table presents the unrealized gains and losses associated with changes in the fair value of our derivatives  which are recorded as an element of cost of natural gas in our consolidated statements of income and disclosed as a reconciling item on our statements of cash flows derivative fair value gains losses december  december  december  in millions natural gas segment hedge ineffectiveness non qualified hedges marketing non qualified hedges discontinued hedges derivative fair value gains losses de designation and settlement of derivatives in connection with the sale of assets in december  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report  we settled for cash of approximately million  natural gas collars representing derivative financial instruments on sales of  mmbtu d of natural gas through we had previously recorded unrealized losses associated with the natural gas collars that were realized upon settlement 
additionally  we de designated derivative financial instruments that qualified for and were designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted sales of bpd of ngls through and contemporaneously closed out the position by entering into an offsetting derivative financial instrument  at market  on forecasted purchases of bpd of ngls through derivative positions our derivative financial instruments are included at their fair values in the consolidated statements of financial position as follows december  december  in millions receivables  trade and other other assets  net accounts payable and other other long term liabilities the decrease in our obligation associated with derivative activities is primarily due to the decline in current and forward natural gas prices at december  in relation to current and forward natural gas prices at december  the partnership s portfolio of derivative financial instruments is largely comprised of long term fixed price natural gas sales and purchase agreements 
we record the change in fair value of our highly effective cash flow hedges in aoci until the derivative financial instruments are settled  at which time they are reclassified to earnings 
we regularly enter into treasury locks to hedge the interest on anticipated issuances of indebtedness 
the settlement of a treasury lock can result in the retention of unrecognized gains or losses in aoci that are amortized to interest expense over the life of the related debt issuance 
we paid million in december  to settle treasury locks in connection with the issuance of million in principal amount of our senior notes 
the million will be amortized from aoci to interest expense over the year life of the senior notes 
also included in aoci are unrecognized losses of approximately million associated with derivative financial instruments that qualified for and were classified as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity transactions that were subsequently de designated 
these unrealized losses are reclassified to earnings over the periods during which the originally hedged forecasted transactions affect earnings 
for the years ended december   and  we reclassified unrealized losses of million  million and million  respectively  from aoci to cost of natural gas on our consolidated statements of income for the fair value of derivative financial instruments that were settled 
we estimate that approximately million of aoci representing unrealized net losses on cash flow hedging activities at december   will be reclassified to earnings during the next twelve months 
we do not require collateral or other security from the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments  all of which were rated bbb or better by the major credit rating agencies
