overview the company provides credit debit card cash advance ccca  atm and check cashing solutions cash access services to casinos  a majority of which are owned and operated by native american tribes 
these products are the primary means by which casinos make cash available to gaming patrons 
the company also provides casinos with ancillary services such as on line reporting  which enhances their ability to monitor player activity and market to gaming patrons 
with our february  acquisition of indian gaming services  the company added casinos as customers and obtained access to other credit and debit processing opportunities 
credit card cash advances and pos debit card transactions our ccca products  which are comprised of both all in atms and company kiosks which house point of sale pos terminals  have been installed at gaming and retail locations 
our ccca products allow gaming patrons to obtain cash from their credit card  or checking account in the case of debit transactions  through the use of our software and equipment 
a gaming patron can initiate a ccca transaction through one of our all in atms or kiosks 
the all in atm or kiosk terminal will prompt the gaming patron to swipe his her credit or debit card and enter the dollar amount requested 
the all in atm or kiosk terminal will then dial the appropriate bank for an authorization or denial 
if authorized  the all in atm or kiosk 
table of contents terminal will direct the gaming patron to a casino cage 
once at the cage  the gaming patron will present his her credit debit card and driver s license 
a cage cashier will swipe the credit debit card in a company terminal to obtain information for the transaction initiated at the all in atm or kiosk terminal 
the purpose of the second swipe is for identification purposes only 
after finding the approved transaction  the cage terminal will provide the cashier with two options in order to obtain the gaming patron s address  driver s license and telephone number  which must be imprinted on each check or voucher 
the first option is to swipe the gaming patron s driver s license if it contains a magnetic strip 
the second option is to manually enter the information into the terminal 
after one of these options is selected  a printer attached to the cage terminal will generate a company check or voucher 
the cashier will give the gaming patron cash in the amount requested after he she signs the company check or voucher 
our check or voucher is then deposited by the casino into its account for payment from a company account and we debit the gaming patron s credit or debit card 
this transaction can be accomplished without the gaming patron using a personal identification number pin 
gaming patrons pay a service charge typically between for credit card advances and a fixed fee of plus for pos debit card withdrawals 
atm cash withdrawals the company offers a full menu of atm services to casinos and retailers 
through the company s standard atms and our all in atms  vault cash for the operation of the atm can be provided by the company or directly by the casino or retailer 
the company processes atm transactions through atm networks with which the company has licensing agreements 
in addition  the company provides atm vault cash  maintenance and armored car service 
in an atm cash withdrawal  a gaming patron directly withdraws funds from his or her bank account by swiping an atm card through one of the company s standard atms or all in atms 
the company s processor then routes the transaction request through an electronic funds transfer network to the gaming patron s bank 
if the transaction is authorized  the atm dispenses the cash to the gaming patron 
gaming patrons pay a fixed fee for atm cash withdrawals 
check cashing solutions the company also offers two check cashing solutions to the gaming industry 
first  the company provides casinos with full service check cashing 
with full service check cashing  the company is given space within a casino to operate a check cashing booth 
the company s employees manage the booth  the company s cash is used to cash checks  and the company retains customer fees from check cashing 
gaming patrons pay a service charge based on the amount of the transaction for our check cashing services 
at december   there were casinos utilizing our full service check cashing services 
second  we self guarantee checks via internal check cashing technology as well as provide check guarantee services with the assistance of third party providers and check verification services 
joint venture and cashclub product in april  the company entered into a joint venture agreement with bally technologies  inc and scotch twist  inc 
joint venture 
through the joint venture  the company anticipates developing products that allow customers to fund player accounts using credit and debit cards tied to a players club card  such that the player s club card can be used in place of a credit or debit card to effectuate transactions within a casino for gaming  dining  retail purchases  and lodging under a license to a portfolio of patents from scotch twist 
if and when this cashless product is developed  bally technologies and cash systems will work together to market and sell the product  initially for use exclusively with bally s hardware and software interface and accounting systems  and will allocate the fees generated from the use of the jointly developed products among the joint venture partners 
we do not anticipate that the development costs related to the joint venture will be material to us 
as an initial step in the development of the joint venture s cashless product and to test gaming patron acceptance of a players club card  in october  the company commenced beta testing of the cashclub product  which enables cash access through the use of a players club card at an atm or kiosk 
initial beta testing may be ended soon 
we are working with the card associations to ensure that the cashclub product and process will comply with the card association rules prior to full deployment into the marketplace 
we do not expect the revenues from the cashclub product in the beta phase to be material to the company 
prior to implementation of the joint venture s cashless product  we will work with the card associations to ensure that the cashless product and process will comply with the card association rules 
at this time  we can give no assurance that we will be able to implement the cashless product in a manner that will comply with the cash association rules 
the company incurred research and development costs relating to the development of its joint venture product 
for the years ended december    and  the company expensed   and  which is included in other general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statement of operations 
internal transaction processing in the past  the company s ccca  pos debit card and atm transactions were settled with its network payers through third party processing providers 
in may  the company beta tested its own internal processing switch at its florida based properties 
as of december   with the exception of a few minor properties  all ccca and pos debit card transactions are processed through an internal company owned switch 
for atm transactions  over of the company s atm devices were converted to the new switch as of year end 
the new internal processing switch enables the company to eliminate third party processing costs by settling transactions directly with its network payers 
due to the change to internal processing  a one to three day timing lag exists between the time the advance occurs and the company is reimbursed 
the effect of this change has been reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheets as settlements due from credit card and atm processors as well as the associated payables due to customer accounts which are reflected in other accrued expenses

critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities for the periods indicated 
the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained herein describe our significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including  but not limited to collectibility of loans receivable  the lives and continued usefulness of property and equipment and software and contingencies 
due to uncertainties  however  it is at least reasonably possible that management s estimates will change during the next year  which cannot be estimated 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because the amount and timing of revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
we follow the guidance of staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  which requires that a strict series of criteria are met in order to recognize revenue related to services provided 
if these criteria are not met  the associated revenue is deferred until the criteria are met 
we recognize commission revenue when evidence of a transaction exists  services have been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the reasonable assurance is based on the transactions being authorized and preapproved by credit card vendors or third parties 
we evaluate our commissions revenue streams for proper timing of revenue recognition 
credit card cash advance revenue is comprised of upfront patron transaction fees assessed at the time the transaction is initiated and a percentage of the face amount of the cash advance 
credit card cash advance revenue is recognized at the point that a negotiable check instrument is generated by the casino cashier or cash cage operation based upon authorization of the transaction 
atm fees are comprised of upfront patron transaction fees or surcharges assessed at the time the transactions are initiated

we engage an independent third party to guarantee the collectability of the checks as well as self guarantee checks 
we record a receivable for all guaranteed checks returned for insufficient funds until determined to be uncollectible 
we have determined that the accounting policies for income recognition described above are in accordance with the financial accounting standards board emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we have recorded an accrual for known and potential chargebacks for possible charges against a gaming patron s credit card that we are unable to establish the validity of the transaction

effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options based on fair values 
the company s determination of fair value of share based payment awards is based on the date of grant using an option pricing model which incorporates a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the company s expect stock price volatility over the eighteen month period prior to the grant date of the awards and estimates regarding projected employee stock option exercise behaviors and forfeitures

recently issued accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board has published fasb interpretation no 
fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  to address the non comparability in reporting tax assets and liabilities resulting from a lack of specific guidance in fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  on the uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements 
specifically  fin no 
prescribes a a consistent recognition threshold and b a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and provides related guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin no 
applies to fiscal years beginning after december   with earlier adoption permitted 
the company is currently evaluating the effects of fin no 
but does not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb has issued sfas no 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements  to eliminate the diversity in practice that exists due to the different definitions of fair value and the limited guidance for applying those definitions in gaap that are dispersed among the many accounting pronouncements that require fair value measurements 
sfas no 
retains the exchange price notion in earlier definitions of fair value  but clarifies that the exchange price is the price in an orderly transaction between market participants to sell an asset or liability in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability 
moreover  the sfas states that the transaction is hypothetical at the measurement date  considered from the perspective of the market participant who holds the asset or liability 
consequently  fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date an exit price  as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability at the measurement date an entry price 
sfas no 
also stipulates that  as a market based measurement  fair value measurement should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  and establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between a market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity observable inputs and b the reporting entity s own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances unobservable inputs 
finally  sfas no 
expands disclosures about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities in interim and annual periods subsequent to initial recognition 
entities are encouraged to 
table of contents combine the fair value information disclosed under sfas no 
with the fair value information disclosed under other accounting pronouncements  including sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  where practicable 
the guidance in this statement applies for derivatives and other financial instruments measured at fair value under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  at initial recognition and in all subsequent periods 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years  although earlier application is encouraged 
additionally  prospective application of the provisions of sfas no 
is required as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  except when certain circumstances require retrospective application 
the company is currently evaluating the effect of adopting sfas no
