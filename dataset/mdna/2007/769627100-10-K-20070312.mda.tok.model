item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overall outlook and recent developments we own and operate riviera las vegas on the las vegas strip in las vegas  nevada  and riviera black hawk in black hawk  colorado 
our capital expenditures for riviera las vegas are geared to maintain the hotel rooms  gaming product and amenities in sufficient condition to compete for customers in the convention market and casino market 
in  we intend to begin a process of upgrading our rooms in las vegas by featuring new euro beds and flat screen tv s 
room rates and slot revenues are the primary factors driving our operating margins 
we use technology to maintain labor costs at a reasonable level  including kiosks for hotel check in  slot ticket redemption and slot club redemptions 
as of december  substantially all of our slot machines had been converted to the ticket in ticket out tito system in both las vegas and black hawk 
in black hawk  the maximum bet restricts table games to a minimum and the area is basically a locals slot customer market 
our capital expenditures in black hawk are geared to maintain competitive slot machines compared to the market and upgrade our food beverage amenities 
our marketing focus in las vegas is on using direct marketing efforts to customers in our database and providing complimentary rooms to our slot customers based on the level of their play  while reducing the number of rooms available for our tour and travel customers 
we also seek to maximize the number of people who patronize las vegas but who are not guests in our hotel by capitalizing on our prime las vegas strip location  convention center proximity and several popular in house productions 
we are well situated on the las vegas strip near circus circus  sahara  las vegas hilton  the las vegas convention center  wynn las vegas  the planned billion echelon project planned on the site of the recently closed stardust and the billion fontainebleau project just to our north  as well as numerous non gaming condominium and time share projects which are either planned or under construction within walking distance of our casino 
however  the recent closures of the stardust and westward ho as well as construction in our immediate area  has caused a significant reduction in walk in traffic and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future 
our marketing focus in black hawk is on using direct marketing efforts to customers in our database and providing exciting events and give aways to our loyalty program members 
on august   our shareholders disapproved the merger agreement that we had entered into on april  and we terminated it 
consummation of the merger as contemplated by the merger agreement would have resulted in our shareholders receiving in cash for each share of our stock that they held 
under the merger agreement  we agreed to pay a topping fee of approximately million if i the merger agreement is terminated because our shareholders did not approve it  ii prior to such termination  a competing takeover proposal which includes a proposal for the acquisition of or more of our assets or more than of our outstanding stock or the stock of any of our subsidiaries or for the acquisition of us or any of our subsidiaries through a merger or other business combination had been announced and had not been withdrawn  and iii within months after such termination  we enter into a definitive agreement with a third party with respect to the consummation of a takeover proposal or any takeover proposal is consummated 
on august   we announced that we received an unsolicited  competing takeover proposal on substantially the same terms and conditions set forth in the merger agreement 
prior to our termination of the merger agreement  that competing takeover proposal had not been withdrawn 
on september   we announced that our board of directors had terminated its consideration of that takeover proposal 
on november   we reported i our receipt of a non binding proposal from ian bruce eichner and the de shaw group  on behalf of an entity to be formed by them  to acquire by merger all of our outstanding shares at a cash price of per share  ii our entry into an exclusive negotiating agreement with mr 
eichner and a member of the de shaw group and iii certain related resolutions adopted by our board of directors 
on december   the exclusive negotiating agreement and the related approvals and waivers by our board of directors expired and the proposal was withdrawn 
in order to attain profitable operations  we must reach income from operations of approximately million  which is percent higher than our year end level of such income based on our current debt structure 
going forward  we expect our sarbanes oxley act expenses to decrease significantly as we move into our third year of being an accelerated filer  we estimate our future annual equity based compensation expense to be approximately  and we expect asset impairment charges to be nominal 
mergers  acquisitions and development costs are in large part the results of contacts made or opportunities offered by third parties  which may be outside of our control and may require our attention and resources in view of our fiduciary duties to stockholders 
if  however  we can significantly reduce our mergers  acquisitions and development costs and meet our estimated requirements mentioned above in this paragraph  our income from operations would exceed million  which would slightly exceed our current interest expense and would likely result in a nominal net income 
if we are able to refinance our notes at a more favorable interest rate  we could save in excess of million for each percentage point reduction in interest rate 
this could have a significant positive effect on our net income 
we are currently exploring refinancing opportunities and we expect to refinance in results of operations compared to the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain operating data for riviera las vegas and riviera black hawk

poker was reestablished in and continued to show growth in entertainment revenues decreased by approximately million  or  from million during to million during due to the closure of our splash show in the main showroom in september and reduced covers in our other shows

the increase was due to a increase in convention room revenue  which made up of total room revenue 
operating income operating income in increased million  to million or from million in this increase is primarily due to increased gaming and hotel revenues as described above  and the effects of increased spending of casino marketing and other expenses in the gaming departments due to increased promotional costs for our th anniversary celebration and free slot play program in that were not profitable when compared to current promotions 
riviera black hawk revenues net revenues for riviera black hawk  which are primarily gaming revenues  increased  or from million in to million in revenues in were negatively impacted by a rockslide that closed a major access road to the market for three months and by other road projects throughout the year 
revenues in were negatively impacted by weather conditions in december  including a large snowfall which caused the major roads to be closed for approximately five days and by increased competition in the region with expansions and new property openings during operating income operating income increased  from million in to million in the improvement results from efficiencies generated from the tito conversion and the asset impairment write off of approximately  due to the discontinuation of a project to build a pedestrian bridge connecting to the isle of capri 
consolidated operations operating income increased million from million in to million in due to increased gaming and hotel revenue and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense as a result of our convention center in las vegas and slot machines and equipment in black hawk becoming fully depreciated in late and early net loss was  in down million from a net loss of million in due to an increase in operating income and reduced interest expense

the increase was due to a increase in convention room revenue  which made up of total room revenue 
revenues at the gaming tables increased million due to an increase in hold percentage as customers continued to play new games  which generally have a high hold percentage 
slot revenues increased slightly  however after deducting cash rebates and free play  net slot revenues were down million or 
surveys indicate that our gaming customers are spending less of their gaming budgets at our casino than in the past 
as a result of these surveys  we have revised our marketing plans to include activities  which our customers favor  including more entertainment on the casino floor during the daytime hours and more food and beverage options 
entertainment revenues decreased by approximately million  or  from million during to million during due primarily to the addition of new shows by las vegas strip competitors 
largely due to this increase in competition  we experienced an overall attendance decrease of  or approximately 
operating income operating income decreased  or  from million in to million in primarily due to higher slot marketing costs in during  casino marketing and other expenses increased million as our margin decreased in the gaming departments  due to increased promotional costs of approximately  for our th anniversary celebration and free slot play programs that supported revenues but were not as profitable when compared with prior promotions

our discussions with that party ended in  and we retained the fee 
net loss increased million from million in to million in due to a decrease in operating income as discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents at december  increased million from december  to million 
cash balances include amounts that may be required to fund our ceo s pension obligation with five days notice 
see notes and to the financial statements 
although we are aware of no current intention of our ceo to require this funding  under certain circumstances we would have to disburse approximately million in a short period  subject to the provisions of our agreement with him 
for  our net cash provided by operating activities increased to million compared to million in due primarily to a decrease in operating loss 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in compared to million in due to an increase in capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was  in compared to million in we believe that cash flow from operations  combined with our million cash and the million available on our senior secured credit facility discussed below  will be sufficient to cover our annual debt service and enable our investment in budgeted capital expenditures 
such expenditures include approximately million in maintenance capital expenditures and property upgrades of approximately million  which we will use primarily for the room renovation program at rivera las vegas  the purchase of slot machines in las vegas and black hawk and for other contingencies 
on june   we secured debt in the principal amount of million in the form of the notes with a maturity date of june  interest on the notes is at the annual rate of  paid semiannually on each june and december cash flow from operations is not expected to be sufficient to pay of the principal of the notes at maturity 
accordingly  our ability to repay the notes at maturity will be dependent upon our ability to refinance the notes 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance the principal amount of the notes at maturity or that any such refinancing will be on favorable terms 
on june   we were able to redeem the notes at a premium beginning at and declining each subsequent year to par in we are currently exploring refinancing opportunities  with a view to refinancing the notes in the second half of  on more favorable terms and rates than exist today 
at that time  the call premium will be 
the note indenture provides that  in certain circumstances  we must offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control or certain other events 
in the event of such mandatory redemption or repurchase prior to maturity  we would be unable to pay the principal amount of the notes without a refinancing 
the note indenture contains certain covenants  which limit our ability  subject to certain exceptions  to incur additional indebtedness  pay dividends or other distributions  repurchase capital stock or other equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  enter into certain transactions with affiliates  create certain liens  sell certain assets  and enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
as a result of these restrictions  our ability to incur additional indebtedness to fund operations or to make capital expenditures is limited 
in the event that cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover cash requirements  we would be required to curtail or defer certain capital expenditure programs  which could have an adverse effect on operations 
as of december   we believe that we were in compliance with the covenants 
on july   we entered into a million  five year senior secured credit facility  which expires july  the credit facility is secured by substantially the same collateral that secures the notes 
the lien on the collateral securing the credit facility is senior to the lien securing the notes 
the credit facility contains customary conditions to borrowing and certain representations and warranties customary in gaming related finance 
the credit facility also contains financial covenants and restrictions regarding  among other things  indebtedness  distributions and changes in control 
under the credit facility  we can obtain extensions of credit in the forms of cash and letters of credit 
we are required to pay interest on all outstanding cash advances at the rate of interest announced by wells fargo bank at its principal office in san francisco as its prime rate plus or at the rate at which major international banks in london charge each other for borrowings libor in us dollars plus 
however  the minimum interest rate we will be charged on outstanding cash advances is 
we expect to refinance a similar type arrangement in the second half of in connection with our refinancing of the notes 
contractual obligations the table under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to adopt accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and provision for income taxes 
we periodically evaluate our policies  and our estimates and assumptions related to these policies 
we operate in a highly regulated industry 
for riviera las vegas and riviera black hawk we are subject to regulations governing operating and internal control procedures 
the majority of our casino revenue is in the form of cash  personal checks or gaming chips and tokens  which by their nature do not require complex estimations 
we estimate certain liabilities with payment periods that extend for longer than several months 
such estimates include customer loyalty liabilities  self insured medical and workers compensation costs and litigation costs 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable based upon our past experience with the business and based upon our assumptions related to possible outcomes in the future 
future actual results might differ materially from these estimates 
we have determined that the following accounting policies and related estimates are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements because such estimates are highly uncertain or susceptible to change so as to present a significant risk of a material impact on our financial condition or operating performance  and such policies and estimates were selected from among available alternatives  or require the exercise of significant management judgment to apply 
long lived assets we have a significant investment in long lived property and equipment 
we estimate that the non discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets exceed the current carrying value of these assets 
any adverse change to the estimate of these non discounted future cash flows could necessitate an impairment charge that would adversely affect our operating results 
we estimate useful lives for our assets based on historical experience  estimates of such classes of assets commercial lives generally  and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
should the actual useful life of a class of assets differ from the estimated useful life  we would record an impairment charge or adjust the period over which this asset is depreciated 
we review useful lives  and obsolescence  and we assess commercial viability of these assets periodically 
deferred tax assets we utilize estimates related to estimated future taxable income in the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
to the realization of deferred tax assets 
our estimates are based upon recent operating results and budgets for future operating results 
the valuation allowance has been recorded for our net operating loss carry forwards  excluding our amt credits  which have an indefinite life 
allowance for credit losses we maintain an allowance for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
any unforeseen change in customer liquidity or financial condition could adversely affect the collectibility of that account and our operating results 
litigation cost accrued we assess our exposures to loss contingencies including legal matters  and we provide for an exposure if it is judged to be probable and estimable 
however  any accruals made in relation thereto do not include the estimated costs of defense for any legal services that we have not yet received 
if the actual loss from a contingency exceeds our estimate  our operating results could be adversely impacted 
self insurance provisions we are self insured for various levels of general liability  workers compensation  and non union employee medical insurance coverage 
insurance claims and provisions include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accrued estimates of incurred but not reported claims 
in estimating these costs  we consider our historical claims experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors can materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 
self insurance reserves can be affected by price changes in the medical field  speed of processing claims by our third party administrator  estimates of claims incurred but not reported  homogeneous nature of claims and other factors 
significant changes in those factors could affect the estimates for self insurance by  or more 
a increase in medical costs could impact our reserves and increase our expense by approximately  on an annual basis 
loyalty club program we offer to our guests the opportunity to earn points redeemable for cash and complimentary rooms and food and beverage based on their level of gaming and non gaming activities while at our properties 
an accrual is recorded as points are earned based upon expected redemption rates and  in the case of complimentaries  the estimated cost of the complimentary to be provided

in june  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue no 
eitf  disclosure requirements for taxes assessed by a governmental authority on revenue producing transactions 
the consensus allows companies to choose between two acceptable alternatives based on their accounting policies for transactions in which the company collects taxes on behalf of a governmental authority  such as sales taxes 
under the gross method  taxes collected are accounted for as a component of sales revenue with an offsetting expense 
conversely  the net method allows a reduction to sales revenue 
if such taxes are reported gross and are significant  companies should disclose the amount of those taxes 
the guidance should be applied to financial reports through retrospective application for all periods presented  if amounts are significant  for interim and annual reporting beginning february  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements
