overview we are an innovator in the field of metrology systems for the semiconductor manufacturing industries 
our systems are designed to precisely monitor film thickness and critical dimensions that are necessary to control the manufacturing process and provide increased production yields and performance 
capital expenditures by manufacturers of semiconductors  especially in asia  and their suppliers are critical to our success 
the demand by these manufacturers and suppliers is driven by the expected market demand for new products and new applications 
the increasing complexity of the mm manufacturing processes for semiconductors is an important factor in the demand for our innovative metrology systems 
the incorporation of smaller features sizes  copper interconnect technology and optical critical dimension technology are expected to result in increased demand 
our strategy is to continue to innovate organically as well to evaluate strategic acquisitions in order to address business challenges and opportunities 
our revenues are primarily derived from product sales  which includes sales of accessories  but are also derived from customer service for the installed base of our products 
in  we derived of our total net revenues from product sales and of our total net revenues from services 
important themes and significant trends the semiconductor equipment industry is characterized by cyclical growth 
recently  the industry emerged from an exceptionally long  cyclical downturn 
changing trends in the semiconductor industry is increasing the need for metrology as a major component of manufacturing systems 
these trends include conversion to mm wafer size 
semiconductor manufacturers are converting to mm wafers to achieve better production efficiencies 
most facilities are incorporating this wafer size  and our newest 
table of contents products are well positioned to serve these facilities 
it is important that we are successful in product evaluations with these new mm facilities in order to continue to gain market share 
incorporation of optical critical dimension metrology in the patterning process 
our customers use phototlithographic processes to create patterns on wafers 
critical dimensions must be carefully controlled during this process 
our proprietary optical critical dimension systems can provide the critical process control of these circuit dimensions that is necessary for successful manufacturing of these state of the art devices 
copper interconnect technology 
the need for ever increasing device circuit speed coupled with lower power consumption has pushed semiconductor device manufacturers to begin the replacement of the subtractive aluminum interconnect process with copper damascene technology 
this new copper processing technology has driven the need for new metrology techniques such as non destructive laser profiling and the use of optical critical dimension ocd technology for control of the copper process 
drive toward nm and nm feature sizes 
in an effort to reduce costs and increase device performance  semiconductor manufacturers are decreasing both the die size and feature size 
monitoring the increased tolerance requirements on smaller features sizes requires increased use of metrology systems 
in addition  new processing methodologies such as dual patterning are driving tighter requirements for imaging overlay metrology 
our thin film  overlay and critical dimension metrology systems are well suited and are being adopted for these next generation processes reduced number of customers 
because of the escalating cost of mm manufacturing facilities  fewer semiconductor manufacturers can afford the significant investment in these next generation facilities 
therefore  fewer opportunities for semiconductors equipment companies exist 
given that the available number of potential customers is decreasing  pre existing customer relationships  product positioning and critical mass take on greater importance 
adoption of new types of thin film materials 
manufacturers are adopting new processes and technologies that increase the importance and utilization of thin film metrology systems 
to achieve greater semiconductor device speed  manufacturers are utilizing copper and new  low dielectric constant low k insulating materials 
our advanced metrology solutions are required in the manufacturing process to characterize these materials 
need for improved process control to drive process efficiencies 
competitive forces influencing semiconductor device manufacturers  such as price cutting and shorter product life cycles  place pressure on manufacturers to rapidly achieve production efficiency 
device manufacturers are using our integrated and standalone metrology systems throughout the fab to ensure that manufacturing processes scale rapidly  are accurate and can be repeated on a consistent basis 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements conforms with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and judgments in applying our accounting policies that have an important impact on our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and related disclosures at the date of our financial statements 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  warranty obligations and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from management s estimates 
we believe that the application of the following accounting policies requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including those discussed below  see note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue includes hardware and also software that is incidental to the products 
for product sales to existing customers  revenue recognition generally occurs at the time of shipment  as our terms are fob shipping point  if we have met defined customer acceptance experience levels with both the customer and the specific type of equipment 
all other product revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance including deemed acceptances 
in japan  where risk of loss and title transfers to the customer upon customer technical acceptance  revenue is recognized upon customer technical acceptance 
all of our products are assembled prior to shipment to our customers 
we often perform limited installation for our customers  however such installation is inconsequential and perfunctory as it is also performed by third parties 
revenue related to spare parts sales is recognized generally upon shipment and is included as part of service revenue 
service revenue also includes service contracts and non warranty  billable repairs of systems 
whereas service revenue related to service contracts is recognized ratably over the period under contract  service revenue related to billable repairs of systems is recognized as services are performed 
on occasion  customers request a warranty period longer than our standard month warranty 
in those instances where extended warranty services are separately quoted to the customer  we follow the guidance of financial accounting standards board technical bulletin  accounting for separately priced extended warranty and product maintenance contracts  associated revenue is deferred and recognized to income ratably over the term of the contract 
unearned maintenance and service contract revenue is included in deferred revenue 
furthermore  generally we do not provide our customers with any return rights 
service contracts may be purchased by the customer when the warranty period expires 
in limited situations we have multiple deliverables in our customer arrangements 
those situations arise with the sale of repair services and parts together 
revenues on such sales are recognized when both the services and parts have been delivered 
we also provide technical support to our customers as part of our warranty program 
upon recognition of product revenue  a liability is recorded for anticipated warranty costs 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
credit limits are established through a process of reviewing the financial history and stability of our customers 
where appropriate and available  we obtain credit rating reports and financial statements of customers when determining or modifying their credit limits 
we regularly evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivable balances based on a combination of factors such as the length of time the receivables are past due  customary payment practices in the respective geographies and our historical collection experience with customers 
we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our risk associated with smaller rather than larger customers and that our reported allowances are adequate 
if however  the financial conditions of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  we may need to record additional allowances which would result in additional general and administrative expenses being recorded for the period in which such determination was made 
inventories we are exposed to a number of economic and industry factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage  or saleable only for amounts that are less than their carrying amounts 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our market  our ability to meet changing customer requirements  competitive pressures in products and prices  and the availability of key components from our suppliers 
we have established inventory reserves when conditions exist that suggest that our inventory may be in excess of anticipated demand or is obsolete based upon our assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors including the following historical usage rates  forecasted sales of usage  product end of life dates  estimated current and future market values and new product introductions 
for demonstration inventory  we also consider the age of the inventory and potential cost to refurbish the inventory prior to sale 
when recorded  our reserves are intended to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
if actual demand for our products deteriorates  or market conditions are 
table of contents less favorable than those that we project  additional reserves may be required 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out method  or market value 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in business combinations over their estimated fair value 
goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the company determined that there were two reporting units  products and services 
the company s impairment review process  which is completed as of the last day of november of each year  compares the fair value of the company s reporting unit to the carrying value  including the goodwill related to each of the reporting units 
to determine the fair value  the company uses the income method and is based on a discounted future cash flow approach that uses estimates including the following for the company s reporting unit revenue  based on assumed market growth rates and the company s assumed market share  estimated costs  and appropriate discount rates based on the particular reporting unit s weighted average cost of capital 
estimates of market growth  market share  and costs are based on historical data  various internal estimates and certain external sources  and are based on assumptions that are consistent with the plans and estimates used to manage the underlying businesses 
the company s business consists of both established and emerging technologies and forecasts for emerging technologies are based upon internal estimates and external sources rather than historical information 
if future forecasts are revised  they may indicate or require future impairment charges 
the company also considered its market capitalization on the dates of the impairment test in determining the fair value of the respective businesses 
the fair value estimates are based on the extensive use of management s estimates and assumptions  and the result of these procedures can have a significant impact on the company s future operating results 
long lived assets the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement requires the company to evaluate its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may be not recoverable 
when the sum of the undiscounted future net cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition is less than its carrying amount  impairment may exist 
to determine the amount of impairment  the company compares the fair value of the asset to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss equal to the difference is recognized 
product warranties we sell the majority of our products with a twelve month repair or replacement warranty from the date of acceptance which generally represents the date of shipment 
we provide an accrual for estimated future warranty costs based upon the historical relationship of warranty costs to the cost of products sold 
the estimated future warranty obligations related to product sales are reported in the period in which the related revenue is recognized 
the estimated future warranty obligations are affected by the warranty periods  sales volumes  product failure rates  material usage  labor and replacement costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual product failure rates  material usage  labor or replacement costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligations would be required 
for new product introductions where limited or no historical information exists  we may use warranty information from other previous product introductions to guide us in estimating our warranty accrual 
the warranty accrual represents the best estimate of the amount necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded warranty reserve and adjust the amounts in accordance with changes in these factors 
income tax assets and liabilities we account for income taxes based on statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities must be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax 
table of contents accounting for assets and liabilities 
also  deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that a portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in the future 
we evaluate the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis to determine whether or not a valuation allowance is appropriate 
factors used in this determination include future expected income and the underlying asset or liability which generated the temporary tax difference 
our income tax provision is primarily impacted by federal statutory rates  state and foreign income taxes and changes in our valuation allowance 
stock based compensation on january   the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r  which requires companies to estimate the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
in march  the sec issued sab relating to sfas r 
we have applied the provisions of sab in our adoption of sfas r 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the application of the accounting standard as of january   the first day of the company s fiscal year in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  the company s financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of sfas r 
as of december   total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options was million which is expected to be recognized as compensation expense over a weighted average period of years 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the company accounted for stock based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb as allowed under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 

under the intrinsic value method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in the company s consolidated statements of operations  because the exercise price of the company s stock options granted to employees and directors equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock at the date of grant 
see note below for more information 

table of contents results of operations the following table presents our consolidated statements of operations data as a percentage of total net revenues for fiscal years  and ended december   december  and january   respectively 
fiscal year net revenues products service total net revenues cost and expenses cost of products cost of service research and development selling general and administrative merger termination fee asset impairment total cost and expenses income loss from operations other income expense interest income interest expense other  net total other income expense  net income loss before provision credit for income taxes provision credit for income taxes net income loss fiscal years  and ended december   december  and january   respectively total net revenues 
our net revenues were comprised of the following categories fiscal year change automated systems integrated systems service total net revenues fiscal year change automated systems integrated systems service total net revenues 
table of contents in  net revenues from automated systems increased as compared to as a result of additional revenues of million and million from accent and soluris  respectively  and higher demand for our automated products as semiconductor manufacturers continue their conversion to mm wafer to achieve better production efficiencies 
the increase in revenues was partially offset by a million decrease of sales from our flat panel display business unit  or fpd  in fiscal due to the sale of our fpd business unit effective in october see sale of flat panel display business unit  below 
sales of our integrated systems increased slightly as our channel distributors continue to integrate our products with growing end customers demand 
service revenue increased as a result of our accent and soluris acquisitions and due to more customers signing up for post warranty service contracts 
in  net revenues from automated systems decreased due to decreased sales of our fpd products of approximately million from decreases in fpd revenues were offset by increases in other automated stand alone systems  particularly our atlas automated metrology product as our customers continue to expand their capacity for mm production 
revenue from integrated systems increased from their level  primarily due to increased penetration in the japanese market for our integrated metrology systems through our oem relationship with ebara 
the increase in product revenues resulted from greater demand for semiconductor process control metrology equipment  particularly in the us and asia as customers added capacity in semiconductor production facilities as a result of continuing favorable economic conditions 
the increase in service revenue was primarily attributable to higher sales of parts and services in the us and asia in  which we believe was due to a growing installed base of systems that have passed their warranty periods 
gross margins 
our gross margin breakdown was as follows in percent products service the product gross margin decreased in as compared to due to higher warranty costs of million as well as acquisition related charges of million related to the intangible assets amortization for developed technology and backlog related to the accent and soluris acquisitions 
the negative gross margin for service improved in as compared to by the positive service margins received from the accent and soluris operations  however  we have not been able to fully recover the higher costs associated with meeting our customers increasing service demands 
the product gross margin decreased to from in due primarily to the decline in profitability of our fpd products see sale of flat panel display business unit  below and to a lesser extent  a higher provision for obsolete inventory as compared to the prior year 
operating expenses 
our operating expenses were comprised of the following categories in thousands fiscal year change research and development selling general and administrative merger termination fee asset impairment total operating expenses 
table of contents fiscal year change research and development selling general and administrative merger termination fee   n a asset impairment   n a total operating expenses research and development 
the increase in research and development expenses in is due to the additional expenses of million and million associated with our acquisitions of accent and soluris  respectively  and to stock based compensation charges of million related to our adoption of sfas r 
the increase was partially offset by cost cutting initiatives undertaken in the fourth quarter of including the sale of our flat panel display business unit in japan and its related research and development function of million and reductions in headcount related expenses in the united states 
research and development expenses were essentially flat in as compared to the decrease was primarily due to a research grant received from the korean government of million and reflective of our cost cutting initiatives undertaken in the fourth quarter of including the sale of our fpd business unit in japan 
in the united states and united kingdom  our research and development efforts are focused on semiconductor metrology 
in south korea  our research and development efforts are focused on the overlay metrology 
we are committed to the development of new and enhanced products and believe that new product introductions are required for us to maintain a competitive position 
selling 
selling increased in due to the addition of million associated with our acquisitions of accent on july  and million associated with soluris on march  in addition we have incurred stock based compensation charges of million related to our adoption of sfas r 
selling expenses decreased in as compared to primarily due to headcount reductions in sales and personnel related expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses in increased as a result of increased headcount related expenses of million as we have expanded and enhanced our finance and administrative functions  higher legal expenses of million associated with our patent infringement lawsuits with kla and with nova measuring instruments ltd  additional general and administrative expense from our acquisitions of accent and soluris of million  stock based compensation charges of million related to our adoption of sfas r and million of higher charges for professional services associated with compliance with regulatory requirements under the sarbanes oxley act 
general and administrative expenses increased in as a result of professional services associated with compliance with regulatory requirements under the sarbanes oxley act  legal expenses related to our ongoing patent infringement lawsuits  increased headcount as we have expanded and enhanced our finance function and expenses associated with the restatement of our financial results for and the first two quarters of merger termination fee 
on january   we entered into a definitive merger agreement with august technology corporation 
on june   we and august technology announced the termination of the merger agreement 
on that date  in accordance with the terms of the merger agreement  august technology paid us a merger termination fee of million plus million as reimbursement of our expenses associated with the merger agreement which we had capitalized in the first and second quarters of asset impairment 
in we recorded an asset impairment charge of million related to certain assets in our fpd business unit 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we should assess the recoverability of assets when events become known which would indicate potential 
table of contents impairment 
we evaluated the estimated future cash flows of certain asset groups in our fpd business unit and determined the undiscounted estimated future cash flows would be insufficient to recover the carrying value of those assets 
the impairment charge was measured based on the excess carrying value of the asset groups in excess of the associated discounted future cash flows 
accordingly  we recorded an asset impairment charge during the second quarter of there was no such impairment charge during other income expense 
our net other income expense consisted of the following categories in thousands fiscal year change interest income interest expense other income loss total other income expense  net fiscal year change interest income interest expense other income loss total other income expense  net the lower interest income is due to lower average cash and cash equivalent balances and lower yields obtained on our investments 
interest expenses relate to our debt obligations in japan and the united kingdom and are expected to decrease  before exchange rate adjustments  with the balance of the debt 
with the acquisition of accent  we incurred foreign exchange losses due to exchange rate fluctuations associated with extensive intercompany balances assumed with the transaction 
other income expense includes a gain on the sale of assets  commission income and rental income and miscellaneous expenses 
total other income increased in as compared to due to higher yields on cash investments and  to a lesser extent  higher cash investment balances 
the increase in interest income was offset by higher currency transaction losses  primarily due to the weakening japanese yen 
provision credit for income taxes 
the credit for income taxes for of million was primarily due to benefiting the losses of certain foreign jurisdictions where sufficient deferred tax liabilities exist 
our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
our income tax expense in and was primarily a result of foreign income taxes as our us federal income taxes were primarily offset by a reduction in deferred tax asset valuation allowances 
in the future  we will continue to review our expectations for future taxable income to determine the amount of valuation allowance necessary to reserve against deferred tax assets 
sale of flat panel display business unit during  our fpd business unit experienced a significant decline in net revenues and related gross profit as other competitors entered the market for these products 
for  flat panel sales declined to approximately million  and less than gross margin  from approximately million of sales and gross margins of approximately for the corresponding prior year 
because of the expected continued decline in profitability  we decided to exit this market 
in september  we entered into an agreement to sell our fpd business unit to toho technology corporation  or toho  effective october toho received a non exclusive perpetual license to use and sell 
table of contents our film thickness measurements systems in the flat panel market in exchange for million 
in addition  toho will pay us a royalty on future sales in excess of million 
toho also purchased certain other existing assets from us including million of inventory and million of equipment related to the fpd business unit 
we did not recognize a gain or loss on this transaction as we had previously evaluated the estimated future cash flows of the fpd asset group and determined the undiscounted estimated future cash flows would be insufficient to recover the carrying value of those assets and we recorded an impairment charge in the second quarter of see asset impairment above 
we have also agreed with toho to continue to provide sales efforts for fpd products and maintenance service for installed units in certain asian countries 
we will receive a commission from toho on their future sales of fpd products in certain designated countries 
as a result of the sale of the fpd business unit  we do not expect this revenue will be replaced except to the extent that we receive future sales commissions from toho 
we expect the sale of the fpd business unit to have an accretive effect to future operating results and cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million as compared to million at december  at december   we had working capital of million compared to million at december  the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and investments for the year ended december  resulted primarily from cash used in operating activities of million  costs associated with our acquisitions of soluris and accent optical of million and repayment of debt of million  partially offset by maturities of short term investments of million and the sale of shares under our employee stock option and purchase plans of million 
as we have successfully closed both the soluris and accent optical transactions  the ongoing need for cash associated with these transactions is expected to be substantially reduced 
we maintain arrangements under which eligible accounts receivable are sold without recourse to unrelated third party financial institutions 
the sale of these receivables accelerates our cash collection and reduces our credit exposure 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information 
uses of net cash for operating activities was million for the year ended december  was comprised of a net loss of million  increases in working capital of million offset by non cash expenses of million 
the non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization of million was driven by acquired intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of accent and soluris and by stock based compensation of million 
for comparison  cash provided by operating activities during the year ended december  of million was comprised of net income of million  including the merger termination fee of million  non cash charges of million including depreciation  amortization and an asset impairment charge of million  and reductions of working capital of million 
investing activities used net cash of million and provided net cash of million and million in  and  respectively 
cash used by investing activities for included cash outlays of million related to our acquisitions of soluris and accent optical technologies 
our capital expenditures were million million and million in   and  respectively 
offsetting the uses of cash was the net reduction in our short term investments  primarily us treasury bills of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the timing of purchases and the initial maturities of us treasury bills result in their classification as cash and cash equivalents or short term investments 
financing activities used net cash of million and provided net cash of million and million in  and  respectively 
cash used by financing activities for was due to repayments of short term and long term debt in japan of million and repayment of million of debt assumed in the accent merger 
these amounts were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of stock from the exercise of employee stock options of million 
cash provided by financing activities in and resulted primarily from the 
table of contents sale of shares under our stock options plans  offset to some extent by the net repayment of debt obligations by our japanese subsidiary 
we have evaluated and will continue to evaluate the acquisition of products  technologies or businesses that are complementary to our business 
these activities may result in product and business investments  which may affect our cash position and working capital balances 
some of these activities might require significant cash outlays 
however  we believe working capital including cash and cash equivalents and funds available to us for our line of credit  will be sufficient to meet our needs through at least the next twelve months 
however  we may require additional cash to fund acquisitions or investment opportunities or other events may arise in the future 
in these instances  we may seek to raise such additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings or from other sources 
we may not be able to obtain adequate or favorable financing at that time 
any equity financing we obtain may dilute your ownership interests and any debt financing could contain covenants that impose limitations on the conduct of our business 
in february we entered into a two year agreement for a revolving line of credit facility in a maximum principal amount of million 
the instrument governing the facility includes certain financial covenants regarding net tangible worth 
all borrowings under this credit line bear interest  at our election  at a per annum rate equal to the bank s prime rate or at the libor rate plus 
the revolving line of credit agreement includes a provision for the issuance of commercial or standby letters of credit by the bank on our behalf 
the value of all letters of credit outstanding reduces the total line of credit available 
the revolving line of credit is collateralized by a blanket lien on all of our domestic assets excluding intellectual property 
although we have no current plans to request any advances under this credit facility  we may use the proceeds of any future borrowing for general corporate purposes or for future acquisitions or expansion of our business 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations as of december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years debt obligations operating lease obligations our debt obligations relate to the expansion of our japanese facilities and to an equipment financing arrangement in the united kingdom 
all amounts include interest  which we are obligated to pay 
we maintain certain open inventory purchase commitments with our suppliers to ensure a smooth and continuous supply chain for key components 
our liability in these purchase commitments is generally restricted to a forecasted time horizon as mutually agreed upon between the parties 
this forecast time horizon can vary among different suppliers 
we estimate our open inventory purchase commitment as of december  was approximately million 
actual expenditures will vary based upon the volume of the transactions and length of contractual service provided 
in addition  the amounts paid under these arrangements may be less in the event that the arrangements are renegotiated or cancelled 
certain agreements provide for potential cancellation penalties

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks related to foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
foreign currency risk a substantial part of our business consists of sales made to customers outside the united states  and of sales in  and  respectively 
a portion of the net revenues we receive from such sales is denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
additionally  portions of our costs of net revenues and our other operating expenses are incurred by our international operations and denominated in local currencies 
foreign currency transactions resulted in a loss of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  our exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations arises in part from current intercompany accounts in which costs primarily product costs from the united states and the united kingdom are charged to our foreign sales subsidiaries 
these intercompany accounts are typically denominated in us dollars and the net payable to the united states parent amounted to million as of december  a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rate at december  would result in less than million increase or decrease in transaction gains or losses which would be included in our net income 
in foreign locations we have million of net liabilities  including long term loans payable to the united states and  as a result  a hypothetical change in the foreign currency exchange rate at december  would result in million increase or decrease in the net assets and a corresponding increase or decrease in other comprehensive income 
interest rate risk our investments in marketable securities are subject to interest rate risk 
however  due to the short term nature of these investments  interest rate changes would not have a material impact on their value at december  and december  we also have fixed rate debt obligations in japan and the united kingdom that are denominated in yens and british pounds sterling and have no interest rate risk 
at december  and december   our total debt obligation was million and million  respectively  with a long term portion of million and million  respectively 
a hypothetical change in interest rates at december  would not have a material impact on our results of operations
