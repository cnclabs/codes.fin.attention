item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital additions and contractual obligations for a summary of principal and interest payments 
the source of funds to fund our operations  including making capital expenditures and servicing principal and interest obligations with respect to our debt  are cash flows from our operations  current cash and cash equivalents  borrowings under available debt facilities  or proceeds from any additional debt or equity financing 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million available under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
we assess our liquidity based on our current expectations regarding sales  operating expenses  capital spending and debt service requirements 
based on this assessment  we believe that our cash flow from operating activities together with existing cash and cash equivalents and availability under our senior secured revolving credit facility 
table of contents will be sufficient to fund our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service requirements through december   including retiring the remaining million of our convertible subordinated notes at maturity in march thereafter  our liquidity will continue to be affected by  among other things  the performance of our business  our capital expenditure levels and our ability to repay debt out of our operating cash flow or refinance the debt with the proceeds of debt or equity offerings at or prior to maturity 
if our performance or access to the capital markets differs materially from our expectations  our liquidity may be adversely impacted 
there is no assurance that we will generate the necessary net income or operating cash flows to meet the funding needs of our business in the future due to a variety of factors  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the other factors discussed in this risk factors section 
if we are unable to do so  our liquidity would be adversely affected and we would consider taking a variety of actions  including attempting to reduce our high fixed costs for example  closing facilities and reducing the size of our work force  curtailing or reducing planned capital additions  raising additional equity  borrowing additional funds  refinancing existing indebtedness or taking other actions 
there can be no assurance  however  that we will be able to successfully take any of these actions  including adjusting our expenses sufficiently or in a timely manner  or raising additional equity  increasing borrowings or completing refinancings on any terms or on terms that are acceptable to us 
our inability to take these actions as and when necessary would materially adversely affect our liquidity  results of operations and financial condition 
absence of backlog the lack of contractually committed customer demand may adversely affect our sales 
our packaging and test business does not typically operate with any material backlog 
our quarterly net sales from packaging and test services are substantially dependent upon our customers demand in that quarter 
none of our customers have committed to purchase any significant amount of packaging or test services or to provide us with binding forecasts of demand for packaging and test services for any future period  in any material amount 
in addition  our customers often reduce  cancel or delay their purchases of packaging and test services for a variety of reasons including industry wide  customer specific and amkor related reasons 
recently  our customers demand for our services has been strong  however  we cannot predict if this demand trend will continue 
because a large portion of our costs is fixed and our expense levels are based in part on our expectations of future revenues  we may not be able to adjust costs in a timely manner to compensate for any sales shortfall 
if we are unable to do so  it would adversely affect our margins  operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
if customer demand does not materialize as anticipated  our net sales  margins  operating results  cash flows and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected 
risks associated with international operations we depend on our factories and operations in china  japan  korea  the philippines  singapore and taiwan 
many of our customers and vendors operations are also located outside of the us we provide packaging and test services through our factories and other operations located in the china  japan  korea  the philippines  singapore and taiwan 
moreover  many of our customers and vendors operations are located outside the us the following are some of the risks inherent in doing business internationally regulatory limitations imposed by foreign governments  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  political  military and terrorist risks  disruptions or delays in shipments caused by customs brokers or government agencies  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  customs  duties and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  and potentially adverse tax consequences resulting from changes in tax laws 

table of contents our management information systems may prove inadequate we face risks in connection with our current project to install a new enterprise resource planning system for our business 
we depend on our management information systems for many aspects of our business 
some of our key software has been developed by our own programmers and this software may not be easily integrated with other software and systems 
we are implementing a new enterprise resource planning system to replace many of our existing systems at significant locations 
we face risks in connection with our current project to install a new enterprise resource system for our business 
these risks include we may face delays in the design and implementation of that system 
the cost of the system may exceed our plans and expectations 
such system may damage our ability to process transactions or harm our control environment 
our business will be materially and adversely affected if our management information systems are disrupted or if we are unable to improve  upgrade  integrate or expand upon our systems  particularly in light of our intention to implement a new enterprise resource planning system 
difficulties expanding and evolving our operational capabilities we face challenges as we integrate new and diverse operations and try to attract qualified employees to support our operations 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  growth in the scope and complexity of our operations 
for example  each business we have acquired had  at the time of acquisition  multiple systems for managing its own production  sales  inventory and other operations 
migrating these businesses to our systems typically is a slow  expensive process requiring us to divert significant amounts of resources from multiple aspects of our operations 
this growth has strained our managerial  financial  plant operations and other resources 
future expansions may result in inefficiencies as we integrate new operations and manage geographically diverse operations 
our success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our key senior management and technical personnel  any of whom may be difficult to replace 
competition for qualified employees is intense  and our business could be adversely affected by the loss of the services of any of our existing key personnel  including senior management  as a result of competition or for any other reason 
we evaluate our management team and engage in long term succession planning in order to ensure orderly replacement of key personnel 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in these efforts or in hiring and properly training sufficient numbers of qualified personnel and in effectively managing our growth 
our inability to attract  retain  motivate and train qualified new personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
dependence on materials and equipment suppliers our business may suffer if the cost  quality or supply of materials or equipment changes adversely 
we obtain from various vendors the materials and equipment required for the packaging and test services performed by our factories 
we source most of our materials  including critical materials such as leadframes  laminate substrates and gold wire  from a limited group of suppliers 
furthermore  we purchase the majority of our materials on a purchase order basis 
from time to time  we enter into supply agreements  generally up to one year in duration  to guarantee supply to meet projected demand 
our business may be harmed if we cannot obtain materials and other supplies from our vendors in a timely manner  in sufficient quantities  in acceptable quality or at competitive prices 
we need to purchase new packaging and testing equipment if we decide to expand our operations sometimes in anticipation of expected market demand  to manufacture some new types of packaging  perform some different testing or to replace equipment that breaks down or wears out 
from time to time  increased demand for new equipment may cause lead times to extend beyond those normally required by equipment vendors 
for example  in the past  increased demand for equipment caused some equipment suppliers to only partially satisfy our equipment orders in the normal lead time frame or increase prices during market upturns for the semiconductor industry 
the unavailability of equipment or failures to deliver equipment could delay implementation of our future expansion plans and impair our ability to meet customer orders 
if we are unable to implement our future expansion plans or meet customer orders  we could lose potential and existing customers 
generally  we do not enter into binding  long 
table of contents term equipment purchase agreements and we acquire our equipment on a purchase order basis  which exposes us to substantial risks 
for example  sudden changes in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the us dollar and japanese yen  could result in increased prices for equipment purchased by us  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we are a large buyer of gold and other commodity materials including substrates and copper 
the price of gold and other commodities used in our business fluctuate 
historically  we have been able to partially offset the effect of commodity price increases through price adjustments to some customers and changes in our product designs 
significant price increases may adversely impact our gross margin in future quarters to the extent we are unable to pass along past or future commodity price increases to our customers 
loss of customers the loss of certain customers may have a significant adverse effect on the operations and financial results 
the loss of a large customer or disruption of our strategic partnerships or other commercial arrangements may result in a decline in our sales and profitability 
although we have over customers  we have derived and expect to continue to derive a large portion of our revenues from a small group of customers during any particular period due in part to the concentration of market share in the semiconductor industry 
our five largest customers together accounted for approximately  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
no customer accounts for more than of our net sales 
the demand for our services from each customer is directly dependent upon that customer s level of business activity  which could vary significantly from year to year 
the loss of a large customer may adversely affect our sales and profitability 
our key customers typically operate in the cyclical semiconductor business and  in the past  have varied  and may vary in the future  order levels significantly from period to period based on industry  customer or amkor specific factors 
we cannot assure you that these customers or any other customers will continue to place orders with us in the future at the same levels as in past periods 
the loss of one or more of our significant customers  or reduced orders by any one of them  and our inability to replace these customers or make up for such orders could reduce our profitability 
for example  our facility in iwate  japan  is primarily dedicated to a single customer  toshiba corporation 
if we were to lose toshiba as a customer or if it were to materially reduce its business with us  it could be difficult for us to find one or more new customers to utilize the capacity  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
capital additions we believe we need to make substantial capital additions  which may adversely affect our business if our business does not develop as we expect 
we believe that our business requires us to make significant capital additions in order to capitalize on what we believe is an overall trend to outsource packaging and test services 
the amount of capital additions will depend on several factors  including the performance of our business  our assessment of future industry and customer demand  our capacity utilization levels and availability  our liquidity position and the availability of financing 
our ongoing capital addition requirements may strain our cash and short term asset balances  and we expect that depreciation expense and factory operating expenses associated with our recent capital additions to increase production capacity will put downward pressure on our gross margin  at least over the near term 
furthermore  if we cannot generate or borrow additional funds to pay for capital additions as well as research and development activities  our growth prospects and future profitability may be adversely affected 
our ability to obtain external financing in the future is subject to a variety of uncertainties  including our future financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  general market conditions for financing activities by semiconductor companies  and economic  political and other global conditions 
the lead time needed to order  install and put into service various capital additions is often significant  and as a result we often need to commit to capital additions in advance of our receipt of firm orders or advance deposits based on our view of anticipated future demand with only very limited visibility 
although we seek to limit our 
table of contents exposure in this regard  in the past we have often expended significant capital for additions for which the anticipated demand did not materialize for a variety of reasons  many of which were outside of our control 
to the extent this occurs in the future  our margins  liquidity  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
impairment charges any impairment charges required under generally accepted accounting principles gaap may have a material adverse effect on our net income 
under gaap  we are required to review our long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are required to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we may be required in the future to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our long lived assets is determined 
such charges have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
increased litigation incident to our business our business may suffer as a result of our involvement in various lawsuits 
we are currently a party to various legal proceedings  including those described in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
for example  we are engaged in an arbitration proceeding entitled tessera  inc v 
amkor technology  inc 
we were also named as a party in a purported securities class action suit entitled nathan weiss et al 
v 
amkor technology  inc et al 
and several similar cases which have now been consolidated  and in purported shareholder derivative lawsuits entitled scimeca v 
kim  et al  kahn v 
kim  et al 
and feldgus v 
kim  et al 
if an unfavorable ruling or outcome were to occur in arbitration or litigation  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
an unfavorable ruling or outcome could also have a negative impact on the trading price of our securities 
the estimate of the potential impact from the legal proceedings referred to in this annual report on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows could change in the future 
we could suffer adverse tax and other financial consequences if taxing authorities do not agree with our interpretation of applicable tax laws 
our corporate structure and operations are based  in part  on interpretations of various tax laws  including withholding tax and other relevant laws of applicable taxing jurisdictions 
from time to time  the taxing authorities of the relevant jurisdictions may conduct examinations of our income tax returns and other regulatory filings 
we cannot assure you that the taxing authorities will agree with our interpretations 
to the extent they do not agree  we may seek to enter into settlements with the taxing authorities which require significant payments or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
we may also appeal the taxing authorities determinations to the appropriate governmental authorities  but we can not be sure we will prevail 
if we do not prevail  we may have to make significant payments or otherwise record charges or reduce tax assets that adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
for example  during the internal revenue service irs conducted an examination of our us federal income tax returns relating to years and  which resulted in a settlement pursuant to which various adjustments were made  including reductions in our us net operating loss carryforwards 
in addition  during  the irs conducted a limited scope examination of our us federal income tax returns relating to years and  primarily reviewing inter company transfer pricing and cost sharing issues carried over from the and examination cycle  as a result of which we agreed to further reductions in our net operating loss carryforwards 
future examinations by the taxing authorities in the united states or other jurisdictions may result in additional adverse tax consequences 
our tax examinations and the related adjustments are described in greater detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents rapid technological change our business will suffer if we cannot keep up with technological advances in our industry 
the complexity and breadth of semiconductor packaging and test services are rapidly increasing 
as a result  we expect that we will need to offer more advanced package designs in order to respond to competitive industry conditions and customer requirements 
our success depends upon our ability to acquire  develop and implement new manufacturing processes and package design technologies and tools 
the need to develop and maintain advanced packaging capabilities and equipment could require significant research and development and capital expenditures and acquisitions in future years 
in addition  converting to new package designs or process methodologies could result in delays in producing new package types  which could adversely affect our ability to meet customer orders and adversely impact our business 
technological advances also typically lead to rapid and significant price erosion and may make our existing products less competitive or our existing inventories obsolete 
if we cannot achieve advances in package design or obtain access to advanced package designs developed by others  our business could suffer 
packaging and testing the packaging and testing process is complex and our production yields and customer relationships may suffer from defects in the services we provide 
semiconductor packaging and testing are complex processes that require significant technological and process expertise 
the packaging process is complex and involves a number of precise steps 
defective packages primarily result from contaminants in the manufacturing environment  human error  equipment malfunction  changing processes to address environmental requirements  defective raw materials  or defective plating services 
testing is also complex and involves sophisticated equipment and software 
similar to most software programs  these software programs are complex and may contain programming errors or bugs 
the testing equipment is also subject to malfunction 
in addition  the testing process is subject to operator error by our employees who operate our testing equipment and related software 
these and other factors have  from time to time  contributed to lower production yields 
they may also do so in the future  particularly as we expand our capacity or change our processing steps 
in addition  to be competitive we must continue to expand our offering of packages 
our production yields on new packages typically are significantly lower than our production yields on our more established packages 
our failure to maintain high standards or acceptable production yields  if significant and prolonged  could result in loss of customers  increased costs of production  delays  substantial amounts of returned goods and claims by customers relating thereto 
any of these problems could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  in line with industry practice  new customers usually require us to pass a lengthy and rigorous qualification process that may take several months  at a significant cost to the customer 
if we fail to qualify packages with potential customers or customers with which we have recently become qualified  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 
competition we compete against established competitors in the packaging and test business as well as internal customer capabilities 
the subcontracted semiconductor packaging and test market is very competitive 
we face substantial competition from established packaging and test service providers primarily located in asia  including companies 
table of contents with significant processing capacity  financial resources  research and development operations  marketing and other capabilities 
these companies also have established relationships with many large semiconductor companies that are our current or potential customers 
we also face competition from the internal capabilities and capacity of many of our current and potential idm customers 
in addition  we may in the future have to compete with a number of companies that may enter the market and with companies that may offer new or emerging technologies that compete with our products and services 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors or that our customers will not rely on internal sources for packaging and test services  or that our business  financial condition and results of operations will not be adversely affected by such increased competition 
environmental regulations future environmental regulations could place additional burdens on our manufacturing operations 
the semiconductor packaging process uses chemicals  materials and gases and generates byproducts that are subject to extensive governmental regulations 
for example  at our foreign facilities we produce liquid waste when silicon wafers are diced into chips with the aid of diamond saws  then cooled with running water 
in addition  semiconductor packages have historically utilized metallic alloys containing lead pb within the interconnect terminals typically referred to as leads  pins or balls 
federal  state and local regulations in the us  as well as international environmental regulations  impose various controls on the storage  handling  discharge and disposal of chemicals used in our production processes and on the factories we occupy and are increasingly imposing restrictions on the materials contained in semiconductor products 
increasingly  public attention has focused on the environmental impact of semiconductor operations and the risk to neighbors of chemical releases from such operations and to the materials contained in semiconductor products 
for example  the european union s recently enacted directives on waste electrical and electronic equipment weee  and restriction of use of certain hazardous substances rohs impose strict restrictions on the use of lead and other hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment 
weee and rohs became effective on july  in response to these directives  we have implemented changes in a number of our manufacturing processes in an effort to achieve rohs compliance across all of our package types 
complying with existing and future environmental regulations may impose upon us the need for additional capital equipment or other process requirements  restrict our ability to expand our operations  disrupt our operations  subject us to liability or cause us to curtail our operations 
intellectual property we may become involved in intellectual property litigation 
we maintain an active program to protect our investment in technology by augmenting and enforcing our intellectual property rights 
intellectual property rights that apply to our various products and services include patents  copyrights  trade secrets and trademarks 
we have filed and obtained a number of patents in the us and abroad the duration of which varies depending on the jurisdiction in which the patent is filed 
while our patents are an important element of our intellectual property strategy and our success  as a whole we are not materially dependent on any one patent or any one technology 
we expect to continue to file patent applications when appropriate to protect our proprietary technologies  but we cannot assure you that we will receive patents from pending or future applications 
any patents we do obtain may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented and may not provide meaningful protection or other commercial advantage to us 
in fact  the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent claims regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
if any third party makes an enforceable infringement claim against us or our customers  we could be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease to provide the services at issue  pay substantial damages  
table of contents develop non infringing technologies  or acquire licenses to the technology we had allegedly infringed 
we may need to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or defend ourselves against claimed infringement of the rights of others through litigation  which could result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources 
furthermore  if we fail to obtain necessary licenses  our business could suffer 
we are currently involved in three legal proceedings involving the acquisition of intellectual property rights  the enforcement of our existing intellectual property rights or the enforcement of the intellectual property rights of others 
we refer you to the matters of tessera  inc v 
amkor technology  inc  amkor technology  inc 
v 
motorola  inc  and amkor technology  inc 
v 
carsem  et al  which are described in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
unfavorable outcomes in one or more of these matters could result in significant liabilities and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
an unfavorable ruling or outcome could also have a negative impact on the trading price of our securities 
the estimate of the potential impact from the legal proceedings referred to in this report on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows could change in the future 
fire  flood or other calamity with our operations conducted in a limited number of facilities  a fire  flood or other calamity at one of our facilities could adversely affect us 
we conduct our packaging and testing operations at a limited number of facilities 
significant damage or other impediments to any of these facilities  whether as a result of fire  weather  disease  civil strife  industrial strikes  breakdowns of equipment  difficulties or delays in obtaining materials and equipment  natural disasters  terrorist incidents  industrial accidents or other causes could temporarily disrupt or even shut down our operations  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the event of such a disruption or shutdown  we may be unable to reallocate production to other facilities in a timely or cost effective manner if at all and may not have sufficient capacity to service customer demands in our other facilities 
for example  our operations in asia are vulnerable to regional typhoons that can bring with them destructive winds and torrential rains  which could in turn cause plant closures and transportation interruptions 
in addition  some of the processes that we utilize in our operations place us at risk of fire and other damage 
for example  highly flammable gases are used in the preparation of wafers holding semiconductor devices for flip chip packaging 
while we maintain insurance policies for various types of property  casualty and other risks  we do not carry insurance for all the above referred risks and with regard to the insurance we do maintain  we cannot assure you that it would be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses 
sars  avian flu and other contagious diseases any recurrence of sars or outbreak of avian flu or other contagious disease may have an adverse effect on the economies and financial markets of certain asian countries and may adversely affect our results of operations 
in the first half of  various countries encountered an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome  or sars  which is a highly contagious form of atypical pneumonia 
in addition  there have been outbreaks of avian flu and other contagious diseases in various parts of the world 
there is no guarantee that an outbreak of sars  avian flu or other contagious disease will not occur again in the future and maybe with much more widespread and devastating effects and that any such future outbreak of sars  avian flu or other contagious disease  or the measures taken by the governments of the affected countries against such potential outbreaks  will not seriously disrupt our production operations or those of our suppliers and customers  including by resulting in quarantines or closures 
in the event of such a facility quarantine or closure  if we were unable to quickly identify alternate manufacturing facilities  this would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations  as would the inability of our suppliers to continue to supply us and our customers continuing to purchase from us

table of contents tessera  inc v 
amkor technology  inc 
on march   tessera  inc filed a request for arbitration the request with the international court of arbitration of the international chamber of commerce  captioned tessera  inc v 
amkor technology  inc the subject matter of the arbitration is a license agreement entered into between tessera and our predecessor in the license agreement pertains to certain patents and know how relating to semiconductor packaging 
in their request  tessera alleges that amkor owes tessera royalties under the license agreement in an amount between and million for semiconductor packages assembled by us through in our answer and counterclaim  we denied that any royalties were owed  and asserted that we are not using any of the licensed tessera patents or know how 
we also asserted defenses and counterclaims of invalidity and unenforceability of the four patents identified by tessera in their request as the basis for their claim us patent nos 
   and 
on november   tessera provided their preliminary claim charts and added two additional patents to the proceeding  us patent nos 
 and  discovery is proceeding  and the arbitration is currently set for a hearing beginning october although we believe that we have meritorious defenses and counterclaims in this matter and will seek a judgment in our favor  as of the date of this annual report  it is not possible to predict the outcome or likely outcome of the arbitration or the total cost of resolving this controversy including the impact of possible future claims of additional royalties by tessera

was filed in the us district court for the district of arizona against certain of amkor s current and former officers and directors 
amkor is named as a nominal defendant 
in september and again in november  the plaintiff amended the complaint to add allegations relating to option grants and added additional defendants  including the remaining members of the current board  former board members  and former officers 
the complaint includes claims for violation of section a of the exchange act  breach of fiduciary duty  abuse of control  waste of corporate assets  unjust enrichment and mismanagement  and is generally based on the same allegations as in the securities class action litigation described above
