item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this section provides management s discussion of the financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations of atmos energy corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
it includes management s interpretation of our financial results  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
several factors exist that could influence our future financial performance  some of which are described in item a above  risk factors 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those set out in such forward looking statements 
cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements made in good faith by us and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  or any other of our documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  forecast  goal  intend  objective  plan  projection  seek  strategy or similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to our strategy  operations  markets  services  rates  recovery of costs  availability of gas supply and other factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following regulatory trends and decisions  including deregulation initiatives and the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions  market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity  commodity price volatility  increasing interest rates and counterparty creditworthiness  the concentration of our distribution  pipeline and storage operations in one state  adverse weather conditions  our ability to continue to access the capital markets  the effects of inflation and changes in the availability and prices of natural gas  including the volatility of natural gas prices  the capital intensive nature of our distribution business  increased competition from energy suppliers and alternative forms of energy  increased costs of providing pension and postretirement health care benefits  the impact of environmental regulations on our business  the inherent hazards and risks involved in operating our distribution business  natural disasters  terrorist activities or other events  and other risks and uncertainties discussed herein  especially in item a above  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
accordingly  while we believe these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
further  we undertake no obligation to update or revise any of our forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to risk management and trading activities  allowance for doubtful accounts  legal and environmental accruals  insurance accruals  pension and postretirement obligations  deferred income taxes and the valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived 
table of contents assets 
our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee quarterly 
actual results may differ from estimates 
regulation our natural gas distribution and regulated transmission and storage operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates  service  maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate 
our regulated operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement requires cost based  rate regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements 
we record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable 
regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process 
as a result  certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet because they can be recovered through rates 
discontinuing the application of sfas could significantly increase our operating expenses as fewer costs would likely be capitalized or deferred on the balance sheet  which could reduce our net income 
further  regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized 
the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations 
the impact of regulation on our natural gas distribution operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 
revenue recognition sales of natural gas to our natural gas distribution customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis  however  the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for natural gas distribution segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed under the cycle billing method  are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 
revenue is recognized in our regulated transmission and storage segment as the services are provided 
on occasion  we are permitted to implement new rates that have not been formally approved by our regulatory authorities and are subject to refund 
as permitted by sfas no 
 we recognize this revenue and establish a reserve for amounts that could be refunded based on our experience for the jurisdiction in which the rates were implemented 
rates established by regulatory authorities are adjusted for increases and decreases in our purchased gas costs through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
purchased gas adjustment mechanisms provide gas utility companies a method of recovering purchased gas costs on an ongoing basis without filing a rate case to address all of the utility company s non gas costs 
these mechanisms are commonly utilized when regulatory authorities recognize a particular type of expense  such as purchased gas costs  that i is subject to significant price fluctuations compared to the utility company s other costs  ii represents a large component of the utility company s cost of service and iii is generally outside the control of the gas utility company 
there is no gross profit generated through purchased gas adjustments  but they provide a dollar for dollar offset to increases or decreases in utility gas costs 
although substantially all natural gas distribution sales to our customers fluctuate with the cost of gas that we purchase  our gross profit is generally not affected by fluctuations in the cost of gas as a result of the purchased gas adjustment mechanism 
the effects of these purchased gas adjustment mechanisms are recorded as deferred gas costs on our balance sheet 
energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity in which we are the principal in the transaction are recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time of physical delivery 
realized gains and losses from the settlement of financial instruments that do not result in physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy trading contracts are included as a component of natural gas marketing revenues 
operating revenues for our pipeline  storage and other segment are recognized in the period in which actual volumes are transported and storage services are provided 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect based upon our collections experiences and our assessment of our customers inability or reluctance to pay 
however  if circumstances change  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions 
accounts are written off once they are deemed to be uncollectible 
derivatives and hedging activities our natural gas distribution segment uses a combination of physical storage and financial derivatives to partially insulate our natural gas distribution customers against gas price volatility during the winter heating season 
these financial derivatives have not been designated as hedges pursuant to sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
accordingly  they are recorded at fair value 
however  because the costs associated with and the gains and losses arising from these financial derivatives are included in our purchased gas adjustment mechanisms  changes in the fair value of these financial derivatives are initially recorded as a component of deferred gas costs and recognized in the consolidated statement of income as a component of purchased gas costs when the related costs are recovered through our rates in accordance with sfas accordingly  there is no earnings impact to our natural gas distribution segment as a result of the use of financial derivatives 
our natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments are exposed to commodity price risk associated with our natural gas inventories  and  in our natural gas marketing segment  on our fixed price contracts 
we manage this risk through a combination of physical storage and financial derivatives  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
option contracts provide the right  but not the requirement  to buy or sell the commodity at a fixed price 
swap contracts require receipt of payment for the commodity based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price on the settlement date 
the use of these contracts is subject to our risk management policies  which are monitored for compliance daily 
we have designated the natural gas inventory held by atmos energy marketing and atmos pipeline and storage  llc as the hedged item in a fair value hedge 
this inventory is marked to market at the end of each month based on the gas daily index  with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in revenue in the period of change 
the derivatives associated with this natural gas inventory have been designated as fair value hedges and are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains or losses in the period of change 
the difference in the spot price used to value our physical inventory gas daily and the forward price used to value the related fair value hedges nymex are reported as a component of revenue and can result in volatility in our reported net income 
we have elected to exclude this spot forward differential for purposes of assessing the effectiveness of these fair value hedges 
we recognize revenue and the associated carrying value of the inventory inclusive of storage costs as purchased gas costs in our consolidated statement of income when we sell the gas and deliver it out of the storage facility 
over time  we expect gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory to be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges  resulting in the realization of the economic gross profit margin we anticipated at the time we structured the original transaction 
we have elected to treat our fixed price forward contracts as normal purchases and sales and have designated the associated derivative contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated transactions 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses on these open derivative contracts are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  and are recognized in earnings as a component of revenue when the hedged volumes are sold 
hedge ineffectiveness  to the extent incurred  is reported as a component of revenue 
additionally  our natural gas marketing segment utilizes storage swaps and futures to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original fair value hedge associated with our physical natural gas inventory  basis swaps to insulate and protect the economic value of our fixed price and storage books and various over the counter and exchange traded options 
although the purpose of these instruments is to either reduce basis or other risks or lock in arbitrage opportunities  these derivative 
table of contents instruments have not been designated as hedges pursuant to sfas accordingly  these derivative instruments are recorded at fair value with all changes in fair value included in revenue 
in addition to mitigating commodity price risk  we periodically manage our exposure to interest rate changes by entering into treasury lock agreements to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost associated with anticipated financings 
we have designated each of our previously executed treasury lock agreements as a cash flow hedge of an anticipated transaction at the time the agreements were executed 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses associated with the treasury lock agreements are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
the realized gain or loss recognized upon settlement of the treasury lock agreement is initially recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income and is recognized as a component of interest expense over the life of the related financing arrangement 
the fair value of all of our financial derivatives is determined through a combination of prices actively quoted on national exchanges  prices provided by other external sources and prices based on models and other valuation methods 
changes in the valuation of our financial derivatives primarily result from changes in market prices  the valuation of the portfolio of our contracts  maturity and settlement of these contracts and newly originated transactions  each of which directly affect the estimated fair value of our derivatives 
we believe the market prices and models used to value these derivatives represent the best information available with respect to closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under then current market conditions 
impairment assessments we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill  intangible assets subject to amortization and long lived assets 
we currently have no indefinite lived intangible assets 
we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise 
we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
we have determined our reporting units to be each of our natural gas distribution divisions and wholly owned subsidiaries 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill 
the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows  future growth rates and the discount rate 
an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we annually assess whether the cost of our intangible assets subject to amortization or other long lived assets is recoverable or that the remaining useful lives may warrant revision 
we perform this assessment more frequently when specific events or circumstances have occurred that suggest the recoverability of the cost of the intangible and other long lived assets is at risk 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows from the operating division or subsidiary to which these assets relate 
these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made 
changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge 
an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by numerous assumptions and estimates including the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets  assumed discount rates and current demographic and actuarial mortality data 
we review the estimates and assumptions underlying our pension and other postretirement plan costs and liabilities annually based upon a june measurement date 
the assumed discount rate and the expected return are the assumptions that generally have the most significant impact on our pension costs and liabilities 
the assumed discount rate  the assumed health care cost trend rate 
table of contents and assumed rates of retirement generally have the most significant impact on our postretirement plan costs and liabilities 
the discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of our pension and postretirement obligation and net pension and postretirement cost 
when establishing our discount rate  we consider high quality corporate bond rates based on moody s aa bond index  changes in those rates from the prior year and the implied discount rate that is derived from matching our projected benefit disbursements with a high quality corporate bond spot rate curve 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is utilized in calculating the expected return on plan assets component of our annual pension and postretirement plan cost 
we estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns  equity risk premiums  asset allocations  the effects of active plan management  the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance 
we also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets 
to the extent the actual rate of return on assets realized over the course of a year is greater than or less than the assumed rate  that year s annual pension or postretirement plan cost is not affected 
rather  this gain or loss reduces or increases future pension or postretirement plan cost over a period of approximately ten to twelve years 
we estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate used in determining our postretirement net expense based upon our actual health care cost experience  the effects of recently enacted legislation and general economic conditions 
our assumed rate of retirement is estimated based upon our annual review of our participant census information as of the measurement date 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension cost ultimately recognized 
a percent change in our discount rate would impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately million 
a percent change in our expected rate of return would impact our pension and postretirement cost by approximately million 
results of operations overview atmos energy corporation is involved in the distribution  marketing and transportation of natural gas 
accordingly  our results of operations are impacted by the demand for natural gas  particularly during the winter heating season  and the volatility of the natural gas markets 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year 
as a result of the seasonality of the natural gas industry  our second fiscal quarter has historically been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of approximately percent of our consolidated net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 
additionally  the seasonality of this industry impacts the levels of accounts receivable  accounts payable  gas stored underground and short term debt balances we report at various time of the fiscal year 

table of contents consolidated results the following table presents our consolidated financial highlights for the fiscal years ended september   and for the year ended september in thousands  except per share data operating revenues gross profit operating expenses operating income miscellaneous income interest charges income before income taxes income tax expense net income earnings per diluted share historically  our regulated operations arising from our natural gas distribution operations and  beginning in fiscal  from our atmos pipeline texas division  contributed to percent of our consolidated net income 
however  in recent years  this contribution has declined due to the growth of our nonregulated natural gas marketing and pipeline and storage businesses coupled with lower natural gas distribution income 
regulated operations contributed percent  percent and percent to our consolidated net income for fiscal years  and our consolidated net income during the last three fiscal years was earned across our business segments as follows for the year ended september in thousands natural gas distribution segment regulated transmission and storage segment natural gas marketing segment pipeline  storage and other segment net income the following table segregates our consolidated net income and diluted earnings per share between our regulated and nonregulated operations for the year ended september in thousands  except per share data regulated operations nonregulated operations consolidated net income diluted eps from regulated operations diluted eps from nonregulated operations consolidated diluted eps the percent year over year increase in net income during fiscal reflects improvements across all business segments 
results from our regulated operations reflect the net favorable impact of various ratemaking rulings in our natural gas distribution segment  including the implementation of wna in our mid 
table of contents tex and louisiana divisions coupled with increased throughput and incremental gross profit margins from our north side loop and other pipeline compression projects completed in fiscal the decrease in net income from our nonregulated operations primarily reflects the impact of a less volatile natural gas market  which reduced delivered gas margins despite a percent increase in sales volumes 
however  our nonregulated operations benefited from higher asset optimization margins  primarily in the pipeline  storage and other segment 
the nine percent year over year increase in net income during fiscal primarily reflects strong results in our nonregulated operations  partially offset by a decrease in our regulated operations 
the net income from our nonregulated operations reflect the favorable impact of a volatile natural gas market  which provided increased opportunities to maximize delivered gas margins 
our nonregulated results were also favorably impacted by recording unrealized gains during fiscal compared to recording unrealized losses in fiscal the decrease in net income from our regulated operations primarily reflects the adverse effects on our natural gas distribution segment of weather adjusted for wna that was percent warmer than normal  the adverse effect of hurricane katrina on our louisiana division and a non recurring  noncash charge to impair our west texas division irrigation assets 
other key financial and significant events for the year ended september  include the following in december  we filed a million shelf registration statement with the sec that replaced our previously existing shelf registration statement 
upon completion of the filing of this registration statement  we received net proceeds of approximately million through the issuance of approximately million shares of common stock 
the net proceeds received were used to repay a portion of our then existing short term debt balance 
in june  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of senior notes 
the net proceeds received  together with million of available cash  were used to repay our million unsecured floating rate senior notes  which were redeemed on july  our total debt to capitalization ratio at september  was percent compared with percent at september   primarily reflecting the million reduction in long term debt and lower short term debt balances as of september  for the year ended september   we generated million in operating cash flow compared with million for the year ended september   primarily reflecting the favorable impact of increased earnings  increased sales volumes attributable to colder weather during the period and lower natural gas prices 
capital expenditures decreased to million during the year ended september  from million in the prior year 
the decrease primarily reflects the absence of capital spending for the north side loop and other compression projects completed in fiscal in march  the texas railroad commission issued an order in our mid tex division s rate case  which prospectively increased annual revenues by approximately million and established a permanent wna based upon a year average effective for the months of november through april 
however  the ruling also reduced the mid tex division s total return to percent from percent and required a million refund  inclusive of interest  of amounts collected from our calendar grip filings 

table of contents see the following discussion regarding the results of operations for each of our business operating segments 
year ended september  compared with year ended september  natural gas distribution segment the primary factors that impact the results of our natural gas distribution operations are our ability to earn our authorized rates of return  the cost of natural gas  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
our ability to earn our authorized rates is based primarily on our ability to improve the rate design in our various ratemaking jurisdictions by reducing or eliminating regulatory lag and  ultimately  separating the recovery of our approved margins from customer usage patterns 
improving rate design is a long term process and is further complicated by the fact that we operate in multiple rate jurisdictions 
the ratemaking activity section of this form k describes our current rate strategy and recent ratemaking initiatives in more detail 
one example of our recent ratemaking initiatives involves the substantial separation of the recovery of our margins from seasonal weather patterns 
prior to fiscal  seasonal weather patterns significantly impacted our natural gas distribution results 
the rate design in our two most weather sensitive jurisdictions  the louisiana and mid tex divisions  which represent approximately percent of our natural gas distribution residential and commercial meters  provided for limited weather protection 
during fiscal  we received wna in these jurisdictions  beginning with the winter heating season 
wna substantially offsets the effects of weather that is above or below normal by allowing us to increase the base rate portion of customers bills when weather is warmer than normal and to decrease the base rate when weather is colder than normal 
accordingly  gross profit margin in our service areas covered by wna should be based substantially on the amount of gross profit that would result from normal weather  despite actual weather conditions that may be either warmer or colder than normal 
after receiving wna in our louisiana and mid tex divisions  we have weather protection for over percent of our residential and commercial meters  which should substantially reduce the volatility in this segment s operating results 
our natural gas distribution operations are also affected by the cost of natural gas 
the cost of gas is passed through to our customers without markup 
therefore  increases in the cost of gas are offset by a corresponding increase in revenues 
accordingly  we believe gross profit is a better indicator of our financial performance than revenues 
however  gross profit in our texas and mississippi service areas include franchise fees and gross receipts taxes  which are calculated as a percentage of revenue inclusive of gas costs 
therefore  the amount of these taxes included in revenues is influenced by the cost of gas and the level of gas sales volumes 
we record the tax expense as a component of taxes  other than income 
although changes in revenue related taxes arising from changes in gas costs affect gross profit  over time the impact is offset within operating income 
timing differences exist between the recognition of revenue for franchise fees collected from our customers and the recognition of expense of franchise taxes 
the effect of these timing differences can be significant in periods of volatile gas prices  particularly in our mid tex division 
these timing differences may favorably or unfavorably affect net income  however  these amounts should offset over time with no permanent impact on net income 
higher gas costs may also adversely impact our accounts receivable collections  resulting in higher bad debt expense  and may require us to increase borrowings under our credit facilities resulting in higher interest expense 
finally  higher gas costs  as well as competitive factors in the industry and general economic conditions may cause customers to conserve or use alternative energy sources

table of contents the million increase in natural gas distribution gross profit primarily reflects a nine percent increase in throughput and the impact of having wna coverage for more than percent of our residential and commercial customers  which increased gross profit by million 
included in this amount was a million increase associated with the implementation of wna in our mid tex and louisiana divisions beginning with the winter heating season 
as a result of the mid tex rate case  our gas distribution gross profit increased by million compared to the prior year 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in mid tex transportation revenue as the rate case reduced the transportation rates for certain customer classes 
the mid tex rate case also required the refund of million collected under grip  which reduced gross profit in the current year 
favorable regulatory activity in the current year increased gross profit by million  primarily due to an million increase in grip related recoveries and a million increase from our rate stabilization clause rsc filings in our louisiana service areas 
these increases were partially offset by an million decrease in gross profit associated with regulatory rulings in our tennessee  louisiana and virginia jurisdictions 
offsetting these increases in gross profit was a reduction in revenue related taxes 
due to a significant decline in the cost of gas in the current year period compared with the prior year period  franchise and state gross receipts taxes included in gross profit decreased approximately million  however  franchise and state gross receipts tax expense recorded as a component of taxes  other than income decreased million  which resulted in a million increase in operating income when compared with the prior year period 
natural gas distribution gross profit also reflects a million accrual for estimated unrecoverable gas costs 
the remaining decrease in gross profit primarily is attributable to lower irrigation margins and a reduction in pass through surcharges used to recover various costs as these costs were fully recovered by the end of fiscal and during fiscal operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense  taxes  other than income  and impairment of long lived assets  increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  operation and maintenance expense  excluding the provision for doubtful accounts  increased million  primarily due to increased employee and other administrative costs 
these increases include the personnel and other operating costs associated with the transfer of our gas supply function from our pipeline  storage and other segment to our natural gas distribution segment effective january  partially offsetting these increases was the deferral of million of operation and maintenance expense in our louisiana division resulting from the louisiana public service commission s ruling to allow recovery of all incremental operation and maintenance expense incurred in fiscal and in connection with our hurricane katrina recovery efforts 
the provision for doubtful accounts decreased million to million for the year ended september  the decrease primarily was attributable to reduced collection risk as a result of lower natural gas prices 
in the natural gas distribution segment  the average cost of natural gas for the year ended september  was per mcf  compared with per mcf for the year ended september  depreciation and amortization expense increased million for the year ended september  compared with the prior year period 
the increase was primarily attributable to increases in assets placed in service during fiscal additionally  the increase was partially attributable to the absence in the current year period of a million reduction in depreciation expense recorded in the prior year period arising from the mississippi public service commission s decision to allow certain deferred costs in our rate base 
operating expenses for the year ended september  included a million noncash charge associated with the write off of costs for software that will no longer be used 
fiscal results included a million noncash charge to impair the west texas division irrigation properties 

table of contents interest charges interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment for the year ended september  decreased to million from million for the year ended september  the decrease primarily was attributable to lower average outstanding short term debt balances in the current year period compared with the prior year period 
regulated transmission and storage segment our regulated transmission and storage segment consists of the regulated pipeline and storage operations of the atmos pipeline texas division 
the atmos pipeline texas division transports natural gas to our mid tex division and third parties and manages five underground storage reservoirs in texas 
we also provide ancillary services customary in the pipeline industry including parking arrangements  lending and sales of inventory on hand 
similar to our natural gas distribution segment  our regulated transmission and storage segment is impacted by seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
further  as the atmos pipeline texas division operations supply all of the natural gas for our mid tex division  the results of this segment are highly dependent upon the natural gas requirements of the mid tex division 
finally  as a regulated pipeline  the operations of the atmos pipeline texas division may be impacted by the timing of when costs and expenses are incurred and when these costs and expenses are recovered through its tariffs

for the year ended september in thousands  unless otherwise noted mid tex transportation third party transportation storage and park and lend services other gross profit operating expenses operating income miscellaneous income expense interest charges income before income taxes income tax expense net income pipeline transportation volumes mmcf the million increase in gross profit primarily is attributable to a percent increase in throughput due to colder weather in the current year and incremental volumes from the north side loop and other compression projects 
these activities increased gross profit by million  of which  million was associated with our north side loop and other compression projects completed in fiscal increases in gross profit also include a million increase from rate adjustments resulting from our grip filing  a 
table of contents million increase from the sale of excess gas inventory and a million increase from new or renegotiated blending and capacity enhancement contracts 
operating expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  due to higher administrative and other operating costs primarily associated with the north side loop and other compression projects that were completed in fiscal interest charges interest charges allocated to the pipeline and storage segment for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to the use of updated allocation factors for fiscal these factors are reviewed and updated on an annual basis 
natural gas marketing segment our natural gas marketing segment aggregates and purchases gas supply  arranges transportation and or storage logistics and ultimately delivers gas to our customers at competitive prices 
to facilitate this process  we utilize proprietary and customer owned transportation and storage assets to provide the various services our customers request  including furnishing natural gas supplies at fixed and market based prices  contract negotiation and administration  load forecasting  gas storage acquisition and management services  transportation services  peaking sales and balancing services  capacity utilization strategies and gas price hedging through the use of derivative products 
as a result  revenues and gross profit from this segment arise from the types of commercial transactions we have structured with our customers and include the value we extract by optimizing the storage and transportation capacity we own or control as well as revenues for services we perform 
to optimize the storage and transportation capacity we own or control  we participate in transactions in which we combine the natural gas commodity and transportation costs to minimize our costs incurred to serve our customers by identifying the lowest cost alternative within the natural gas supplies  transportation and markets to which we have access 
additionally  we engage in natural gas storage transactions in which we seek to find and profit from the pricing differences that occur over time 
we purchase physical natural gas and then sell financial contracts at favorable prices to lock in gross profit margins 
through the use of transportation and storage services and derivative contracts  we seek to capture gross profit margin through the arbitrage of pricing differences in various locations and by recognizing pricing differences that occur over time 
aem continually manages its net physical position to enhance the future economic profit it captured when an original transaction was executed 
therefore  aem may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions or adjust the amount of storage capacity it holds on a discretionary basis in an effort to achieve this objective 
the natural gas inventory used in our natural gas marketing storage activities is marked to market at the end of each month based upon the gas daily index with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
we use derivatives  designated as fair value hedges  to hedge this natural gas inventory 
these derivatives are marked to market each month based upon the nymex price with changes in fair value recognized as unrealized gains and losses in the period of change 
the changes between the spreads between the forward natural gas prices used to value the financial hedges designated against our physical inventory and the market spot prices used to value our physical storage result in the unrealized margins reported as a part of our storage activities until the underlying physical gas is cycled and the related financial derivatives are settled 
aem also uses derivative instruments to capture additional storage arbitrage opportunities that arise subsequent to the execution of the original physical inventory hedge and to insulate and protect the economic value within its storage and marketing activities 
changes in fair value associated with these financial 
table of contents instruments are recognized as unrealized gains and losses within aem s storage and marketing activities until they are settled 
review of financial and operating results financial and operational highlights for our natural gas marketing segment for the years ended september  and are presented below 
gross profit margin for our natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of margins earned from the delivery of gas and related services requested by our customers  and asset optimization activities  which are derived from the utilization of our managed proprietary and third party storage and transportation assets to capture favorable arbitrage spreads through natural gas trading activities 
unrealized margins represent the unrealized gains or losses on the derivative contracts used by our natural gas marketing segment to manage commodity price risk as described above 
these margins fluctuate based upon changes in the spreads between the physical and forward natural gas prices 
generally  if the physical financial spread narrows  we will record unrealized gains or lower unrealized losses 
if the physical financial spread widens  we will record unrealized losses or lower unrealized gains 
the magnitude of the unrealized gains and losses is also contingent upon the levels of our net physical position at the end of the reporting period

this decrease reflects the impact of a less volatile market  which reduced opportunities to take advantage of pricing differences between hubs  partially offset by a percent increase in sales volumes attributable to successful execution of our marketing strategies and colder weather in the current fiscal year compared with the prior year 
asset optimization margins increased million compared with the prior year period 
the increase reflects greater cycled storage volumes during the current year period  partially offset by an increase in storage fees and park and loan fees which reduced the arbitrage spreads available 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased to million for the 
table of contents year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase in operating expense primarily was attributable to an increase in employee and other administrative costs 
miscellaneous income miscellaneous income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase primarily was attributable to increased investment income earned on overnight investments during the current year period combined with increased interest income earned on our margin account associated with increased margin requirements during the current year 
interest charges interest charges for the year ended september  decreased to million from million for the year ended september  the decrease was attributable to lower borrowing requirements during the current year period 
economic gross profit aem monitors the impacts of its asset optimization efforts by estimating the gross profit that it captured through the purchase and sale of physical natural gas and the associated financial derivatives 
the reconciliation below of the economic gross profit  combined with the effect of unrealized gains or losses recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the financial statements in prior periods  is presented to provide a measure of the potential gross profit from asset optimization that could occur in future periods if aem s optimization efforts are executed as planned 
we consider this measure of potential gross profit a non gaap financial measure as it is calculated using both forward looking and historical financial information 
the following table presents aem s economic gross profit and its potential gross profit for the last three fiscal years 
associated net net physical economic gross unrealized gain potential gross period ending position profit loss profit bcf in millions in millions in millions september  september  september  as of september   based upon aem s derivatives position and inventory withdrawal schedule  the economic gross profit was million 
this amount is reduced by million of net unrealized gains recorded in the financial statements as of september  that will reverse when the inventory is withdrawn and the accompanying financial derivatives are settled 
therefore  the potential gross profit was million 
this potential gross profit amount will not result in an equal increase in future net income as aem will incur additional storage and other operational expenses and increased income taxes to realize this amount 
the economic gross profit is based upon planned injection and withdrawal schedules  and the realization of the economic gross profit is contingent upon the execution of this plan  weather and other execution factors 
since aem actively manages and optimizes its portfolio to enhance the future profitability of its storage position  it may change its scheduled injection and withdrawal plans from one time period to another based on market conditions 
therefore  we cannot ensure that the economic gross profit or the potential gross profit calculated as of september  will be fully realized in the future or in what time period 
further  if we experience operational or other issues which limit our ability to optimally manage our stored gas positions  our earnings could be adversely impacted 

table of contents pipeline  storage and other segment our pipeline  storage and other segment primarily consists of the operations of atmos pipeline and storage  llc aps  atmos energy services  llc aes and atmos power systems  inc  which are each wholly owned by aeh 
aps owns or has an interest in underground storage fields in kentucky and louisiana 
we use these storage facilities to reduce the need to contract for additional pipeline capacity to meet customer demand during peak periods 
additionally  beginning in fiscal  aps initiated activities in the natural gas gathering business 
as of september   these activities were limited in nature 
aes  through december   provided natural gas management services to our natural gas distribution operations  other than the mid tex division 
these services included aggregating and purchasing gas supply  arranging transportation and storage logistics and ultimately delivering the gas to our natural gas distribution service areas at competitive prices 
effective january   these activities were moved to our shared services function included in our natural gas distribution segment 
aes continues to provide limited services to our natural gas distribution divisions  and the revenues aes receives are equal to the costs incurred to provide those services 
through atmos power systems  inc  we have constructed electric peaking power generating plants and associated facilities and lease these plants through lease agreements that are accounted for as sales under generally accepted accounting principles 
results for this segment are primarily impacted by seasonal weather patterns and volatility in the natural gas markets 
additionally  this segment s results include an unrealized component as aps hedges its risk associated with its asset optimization activities

table of contents operating expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  primarily due to a million noncash charge associated with the write off of costs associated with a natural gas gathering project 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in employee and other administrative costs associated with the transfer of gas supply operations from the pipeline  storage and other segment to our natural gas distribution segment effective january  miscellaneous income miscellaneous income increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to million received from leasing certain mineral interests coupled with an increase in interest income recorded in the pipeline  storage and other segment 
interest charges interest charges allocated to the pipeline  storage and other segment for the year ended september  decreased to million from million for the year ended september  the decrease was attributable to the use of updated allocation factors for fiscal these factors are reviewed and updated on an annual basis

heating degree heating degree operating days percent operating days percent income of normal income of normal in thousands  except degree day information colorado kansas kentucky mid states louisiana mid tex mississippi west texas other total adjusted for service areas that have weather normalized operations 
for service areas that have weather normalized operations  normal degree days are used instead of actual degree days in computing the total number of heating degree days 
natural gas distribution gross profit increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total throughput for our natural gas distribution business was bcf during the current year compared to bcf in the prior year 
the increase in natural gas distribution gross profit  despite lower throughput  primarily reflects higher franchise fees and state gross receipts taxes  which are paid by customers and have no permanent effect on net income 
additionally  margins increased approximately million due to rate increases received from our fiscal and fiscal grip filings and the recognition of million that had been previously deferred in louisiana following the lpsc s ratification of our agreement in may these increases were partially offset by approximately million due to the impact of significantly warmer than normal weather  particularly in our mid tex and louisiana divisions 
for the year ended september   weather was percent warmer than normal  as adjusted for jurisdictions with weather normalized operations and two percent warmer than the prior year 
in the mid tex and louisiana divisions  which did not have weather normalized rates during the winter heating season  weather was percent and percent warmer than normal 
additionally  natural gas distribution gross profit decreased approximately million compared with the prior year in the louisiana division due to the impact of hurricane katrina 
service has been restored in some areas affected by the storm  however  it is likely that service will not be restored to all of the affected service areas 
as more fully described under ratemaking activity  we implemented new rates in september that reflect the impact of hurricane katrina 
operating expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase reflects a million increase in taxes  other than income  primarily related to franchise fees and state gross receipts taxes  both of which are calculated as a percentage of revenue  and are paid by our customers as a component of their monthly bills 
although these amounts are included as a component of revenue in accordance with our tariffs  timing differences between when these amounts are billed to our customers and when we recognize the associated expense may affect net income favorably or unfavorably on a temporary basis 
however  there is no permanent effect on net income 
operation and maintenance expense  excluding the provision for doubtful accounts  increased million primarily due to higher employee costs associated with increased headcount to fill positions that were previously outsourced to a third party  higher medical and dental claims and increased pension and 
table of contents postretirement costs resulting from changes in the assumptions used to determine our fiscal costs 
increased line locate  telecommunication and facilities costs also contributed to the overall increase 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in third party costs for outsourced administrative and meter reading functions that were in sourced during fiscal operation and maintenance expense for the year ended september  was also favorably impacted by the absence of million of merger and integration cost amortization associated with the merger of united cities gas company in july  as these costs were fully amortized by december the provision for doubtful accounts increased million to million for the year ended september   compared with million in the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to increased collection risk associated with higher natural gas prices 
in the natural gas distribution segment  the average cost of natural gas for the year ended september  was per mcf  compared with per mcf for the year ended september  additionally  during the first quarter of fiscal  the mpsc  in connection with the modification of our rate design  decided to allow the recovery of million in deferred costs  which it had originally disallowed in its september decision 
this charge was originally recorded in fiscal this ruling decreased our depreciation expense during the year ended september  this decrease was offset by increased depreciation expense associated with the placement of various capital projects into service during the fiscal year 
operating expenses were also impacted by a million noncash charge to impair our west texas division s irrigation assets 
during the fiscal fourth quarter  we determined that  as a result of declining irrigation sales primarily associated with our agricultural customers shift from gas powered pumps to electric pumps  the west texas division s irrigation assets would not be able to generate sufficient future cash flows from operations to recover the net investment in these assets 
therefore  the entire net book value was written off 
we will continue to operate these assets until we determine a plan for these assets as we are obligated to provide natural gas services to certain customers served by these assets 
we are currently evaluating an opportunity to sell these assets in the first quarter of fiscal we do not expect the outcome of this potential transaction to materially affect our results of operations 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  our natural gas distribution segment operating income for the year ended september  decreased to million from million for the year ended september  miscellaneous income miscellaneous income for the year ended september  was million compared to miscellaneous income of million for the year ended september  this increase was primarily attributable to increased interest income on intercompany borrowings to our natural gas marketing segment to fund its working capital needs 
this increase was partially offset by a million charge recorded during the fiscal second quarter associated with an adverse ruling in tennessee related to the calculation of a performance based rate mechanism associated with gas purchases 
interest charges interest charges allocated to the natural gas distribution segment for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to higher average outstanding short term debt balances to fund natural gas purchases at significantly higher prices coupled with an approximate basis point increase in the interest rate on our million unsecured floating rate senior notes due due to an increase in the three month libor rate 
these increases were partially offset by million of interest savings arising from the early payoff of million of our first mortgage bonds in june

excluding intersegment transportation volumes  total pipeline transportation volumes were bcf during the current year compared with bcf in the prior year 
the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to increased third party throughput and ancillary service margins 
the increase in third party transportation margins was primarily attributable to increases in the electric generation market due to the warmer than normal temperatures during the summer of  increased demand for through system transportation services due to a widening of pricing differentials between the pipeline s hubs and the impact of atmos pipeline texas north side loop and other compression projects that were placed into service in june storage and parking and lending services on atmos pipeline texas also increased during fiscal as a result of the widening of pricing differentials between the pipeline s hubs  which increased the attractiveness of storing gas on the pipeline and our ability to obtain improved margins for these services 
the increases on atmos pipeline texas system were partially offset by a decrease in margins earned from intercompany transportation services to our mid tex division due to the significantly warmer than normal weather experienced during fiscal additionally  these increases were partially offset by the absence of inventory sales of million realized in the prior year 
operating expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  due to higher employee benefit costs associated with an increase in headcount  increased pension and postretirement costs resulting from changes in the assumptions used to determine our fiscal costs  higher facilities costs and higher pipeline integrity costs 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  our regulated transmission and storage segment operating income for the year ended september  decreased to million from million for the year ended september

delivered gas margins increased million during fiscal as a result of increased sales volumes resulting from focusing our marketing efforts on higher margin opportunities partially offset by warmer than normal weather across our market areas 
the increase in gas delivery margins also reflected our ability to successfully capture increased per unit margins in certain market areas that experienced higher market volatility 
asset optimization margins decreased million primarily due to the realization of less favorable arbitrage spreads during the current year period compared with the prior year  coupled with increased storage fees 
the favorable unrealized margin variance primarily was due to a favorable movement during the year ended september  in the forward natural gas prices associated with financial derivatives used in our gas delivery activities  a narrowing of the physical forward spreads during fiscal and positive basis ineffectiveness on our financial derivatives 
these results were magnified by a bcf increase in our net physical position at september  compared to the prior year 
operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  the increase in operating expense primarily was attributable to an increase in personnel costs due to increased headcount and an increase in regulatory compliance costs 
the improved gross profit margin partially offset by higher operating expenses resulted in an increase in our natural gas marketing segment operating income to million for the year ended september  compared with operating income of million for the year ended september  
table of contents interest charges interest charges allocated to the natural gas marketing segment for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was attributable to higher average outstanding debt balances to fund natural gas purchases at significantly higher prices

additionally  aps recorded increased margins from its asset optimization activities due to its ability to capture more favorable arbitrage spreads 
operating expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  due to higher employee and other administrative costs 
as a result of the aforementioned factors  our pipeline  storage and other segment operating income for the year ended september  increased to million from million for the year ended september  liquidity and capital resources our internally generated funds and borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program generally provide the liquidity needed to fund our working capital  capital expenditures and other cash needs 
additionally  from time to time  we raise funds from the public debt and equity capital markets through our existing shelf registration statement to fund our liquidity needs 

table of contents cash flows our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
these include regulatory changes  the price for our services  the demand for our services  margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices  operational risks and other factors 
cash flows from operating activities year over year changes in our operating cash flows are primarily attributable to working capital changes within our natural gas distribution segment resulting from the impact of the price of natural gas and the timing of customer collections  payments for natural gas purchases  deferred gas cost recoveries and weather 
for the year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 
year ended september  fiscal operating cash flows reflect the favorable timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued liabilities  which increased operating cash flow by million 
additionally  improved management of our deferred gas cost balances increased operating cash flow by million 
finally  increased net income and other favorable working capital changes contributed to the increase in operating cash flow 
partially offsetting these increases in operating cash flow was a decrease in customer collections of million due to the decrease in the price of natural gas during the current year 
year ended september  fiscal operating cash flows reflect the adverse impact of significantly higher natural gas prices 
year over year  unfavorable timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities reduced operating cash flow by million 
partially offsetting these outflows were higher customer collections million and reduced payments for natural gas inventories million 
additionally  favorable movements in the market indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities reduced the amount that we were required to deposit in a margin account and therefore favorably affected operating cash flow by million 
year ended september  fiscal operating cash flows reflect the effects of a million increase in net income and effective working capital management partially offset by higher natural gas prices 
working capital management efforts  which affected the timing of payments for accounts payable and other accrued liabilities  favorably affected operating cash flow by million 
however  these efforts were partially offset by reduced cash flow generated from accounts receivable changes by million  primarily attributable to higher natural gas prices  and an increase in our natural gas inventories attributable to a percent year over year increase in natural gas prices coupled with increased natural gas inventory levels  which reduced operating cash flow by million 
operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by unfavorable movements in the indices used to value our natural gas marketing segment risk management assets and liabilities  which resulted in a net liability for the segment 
accordingly  under the terms of the associated derivative contracts  we were required to deposit million into a margin account 
cash flows from investing activities in recent years  a substantial portion of our cash resources has been used to fund acquisitions and growth projects  our ongoing construction program and improvements to information systems 
our ongoing construction program enables us to provide natural gas distribution services to our existing customer base  expand our natural gas distribution services into new markets  enhance the integrity of our pipelines and  more recently  expand our intrastate pipeline network 
in executing our current rate strategy  we are directing discretionary 
table of contents capital spending to jurisdictions that permit us to earn a return on our investment timely 
currently  our mid tex  louisiana  mississippi and west texas natural gas distribution divisions and our atmos pipeline texas division have rate designs that provide the opportunity to include in their rate base approved capital costs on a periodic basis without being required to file a rate case 
for the year ended september   we incurred million for capital expenditures compared with million for the year ended september  and million for the year ended september  the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal primarily reflects the absence of capital expenditures associated with our north side loop and other pipeline compression projects  which were completed during the fiscal third quarter 
our cash used for investing activities for the year ended september  reflects the billion cash paid for the txu gas acquisition  including related transaction costs and expenses 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended september   our financing activities used million in cash compared with million and billion provided for the years ended september  and our significant financing activities for the years ended september   and are summarized as follows in december  we raised net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of approximately million shares of common stock  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option of million shares  under a shelf registration statement filed with the sec in december the net proceeds from this issuance were used to reduce our then existing short term debt balance 
in june  we issued million of senior notes due the effective interest rate of this offering  inclusive of all debt issue costs  was percent 
after giving effect to the settlement of our million treasury lock agreement in june  the effective rate on these senior notes was reduced to percent 
we used the net proceeds of million  together with million of available cash  to repay our million unsecured floating rate senior notes  which were redeemed on july  during the years ended september  and  we increased our borrowings under our short term facilities by million and million whereas during the year ended september   we repaid a net million under our short term facilities 
net borrowings under our short term facilities during fiscal and reflect the impact of seasonal natural gas purchases and the effect of higher natural gas prices 
we repaid million of long term debt during the year ended september   compared with million during the year ended september  and million during the year ended september  fiscal payments reflected the repayment of million of our first mortgage bonds 
in connection with this repayment we paid a million make whole premium in accordance with the terms of the agreements and accrued interest of approximately million 
during the year ended september   we paid million in cash dividends compared with dividend payments of million and million for the years ended september  and the increase in dividends paid over the prior year period reflects the increase in our dividend rate from per share during fiscal to per share during fiscal  combined with a million increase in shares outstanding due to share issuances in connection with our december equity offering and new share issuances under our various plans 
in october  we sold a total of million shares of common stock  including the underwriters exercise of their overallotment option  generating net proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  we issued billion of senior unsecured debt 
the net proceeds from these issuances  combined with the net proceeds of million from a july common stock offering were used to finance the acquisition of our mid tex and atmos pipeline texas divisions and settle treasury lock agreements  into which we entered to fix the treasury yield component of the interest cost of financing associated with million of the billion long term debt we issued 

table of contents in addition to the december equity offering described above  during the year ended september  we issued million shares of common stock which generated net proceeds of million 
in addition  we granted million shares of common stock under our long term incentive plan to directors  officers and other participants in the plan

borrowings under our uncommitted credit facilities are made on a when and as needed basis at the discretion of the banks 
our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our short term borrowing requirements  which are typically highest during colder winter months 
our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers needs during periods of cold weather 
as of september   the amount available to us under our credit facilities  net of outstanding letters of credit  was million 
we believe these credit facilities  combined with our operating cash flows will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs 
these facilities are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
shelf registration on december   we filed a registration statement with the sec to issue  from time to time  up to million in common stock and or debt securities available for issuance  including approximately million of capacity carried over from our prior shelf registration statement filed with the sec in august in december  we sold approximately million shares of common stock in an equity offering under the registration statement and used the net proceeds to reduce short term debt 
in june  we issued million of senior notes due in a debt offering under the registration statement 
the net proceeds of approximately million  together with million of available cash  were used to repay our million unsecured floating rate senior notes in july after these issuances  we have approximately million of availability remaining under the registration statement 
however  due to certain restrictions imposed by one state regulatory commission on our ability to issue securities under the registration statement  we now have remaining and available for issuance a total of approximately million of equity securities  million of senior debt securities and million of subordinated debt securities

aem was committed to purchase bcf within one year and bcf within one to three years under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from to per mcf 
with the exception of our mid tex division  our natural gas distribution segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year 
commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices 
commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the

our mid tex division maintains long term supply contracts to ensure a reliable source of gas for our customers in its service area which obligate it to purchase specified volumes at market prices 
the estimated commitments under these contract terms as of september  are reflected in the table above 
risk management activities we conduct risk management activities through our natural gas distribution  natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to reduce our exposure to unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives  including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
to the extent our inventory cost and actual sales and actual purchases do not correlate with the changes in the market indices we use in our hedges  we could experience ineffectiveness or the hedges may no longer meet the accounting requirements for hedge accounting  resulting in the derivatives being treated as mark to market instruments through earnings 
we record our derivatives as a component of risk management assets and liabilities  which are classified as current or noncurrent based upon the anticipated settlement date of the underlying derivative

the remaining costs are recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 

table of contents the decrease in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal compared with fiscal primarily reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june  the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan s liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid 
in the period leading up to our june  measurement date  these interest rates were increasing  which resulted in a basis point increase in our discount rate used to determine our fiscal net periodic and post retirement cost to percent 
this increase had the effect of decreasing the present value of our plan liabilities and associated expenses 
this favorable impact was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of reducing the expected return on our pension plan assets by basis points to percent  which has the effect of increasing our pension and postretirement benefit cost 
the increase in total net periodic pension and other benefits cost during fiscal compared with the prior year primarily reflects changes in assumptions we made during our annual pension plan valuation completed june  the discount rate used to compute the present value of a plan s liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which the benefits will be paid 
in the period leading up to our june  measurement date  these interest rates were declining  which resulted in a basis point reduction in our discount rate to percent 
this reduction increased the present value of our plan liabilities and associated expenses 
additionally  we reduced the expected return on our pension plan assets by basis points to percent  which also increased our pension and postretirement benefit cost 
pension and postretirement plan funding generally  our funding policy is to contribute annually an amount in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of however  additional voluntary contributions are made from time to time as considered necessary 
contributions are intended to provide not only for benefits attributed to service to date but also for those expected to be earned in the future 
during fiscal  we did not contribute to our pension plans 
during fiscal  we voluntarily contributed million to the atmos energy corporation retirement plan for mississippi valley gas union employees 
that contribution achieved a desired level of funding by satisfying the minimum funding requirements while maximizing the tax deductible contribution for this plan for plan year during fiscal  we voluntarily contributed million to the master trust to maintain the level of funding we desire relative to our accumulated benefit obligation 
we made the contribution because declining high yield corporate bond yields in the period leading up to our june  measurement date resulted in an increase in the present value of our plan liabilities 
we contributed million  million and million to our postretirement benefits plans for the years ended september   and the contributions represent the portion of the postretirement costs we are responsible for under the terms of our plan and minimum funding required by state regulatory commissions 
outlook for fiscal market conditions as of the june  valuation date were similar to market conditions as of our june  measurement date  therefore  we maintained the discount rate for determining our fiscal pension and benefit costs at percent and the expected return on our pension plan assets at percent 
accordingly  we expect our fiscal pension and postretirement medical costs to be materially the same as fiscal we are not required to make a minimum funding contribution to our pension plans during fiscal  nor  at this time  do we intend to make voluntary contributions during however  we anticipate contributing approximately million to our postretirement medical plans during fiscal the projected pension liability  future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change  depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the 
table of contents determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date 
these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns  changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 
recent accounting developments recent accounting developments and their impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to risks associated with commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk is the potential loss that we may incur as a result of changes in the fair value of a particular instrument or commodity 
interest rate risk results from our portfolio of debt and equity instruments that we issue to provide financing and liquidity for our business activities 
we conduct risk management activities through both our natural gas distribution and natural gas marketing segments 
in our natural gas distribution segment  we use a combination of physical storage  fixed physical contracts and fixed financial contracts to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases 
in our natural gas marketing segment  we manage our exposure to the risk of natural gas price changes and lock in our gross profit margin through a combination of storage and financial derivatives including futures  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
our risk management activities and related accounting treatment are described in further detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term commercial paper and our other short term borrowings 
commodity price risk natural gas distribution segment we purchase natural gas for our natural gas distribution operations 
substantially all of the costs of gas purchased for natural gas distribution operations are recovered from our customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
however  our natural gas distribution operations have commodity price risk exposure to fluctuations in spot natural gas prices related to purchases for sales to our nonregulated energy services customers at fixed prices 
for our natural gas distribution segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a hypothetical percent increase in the portion of our gas costs related to fixed price nonregulated sales 
based on these projected nonregulated gas sales  a hypothetical percent increase in fixed prices based upon the september  three month market strip  would increase our purchased gas cost by approximately million in fiscal natural gas marketing and pipeline  storage and other segments our natural gas marketing segment is also exposed to risks associated with changes in the market price of natural gas 
for our natural gas marketing segment  we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate commodity price risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate commodity price risk by applying a change in the forward nymex price to our net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at the end of each period 
based on aeh s net open position including existing storage and related financial contracts at september  of bcf  a change in the forward nymex price would have had a million impact on our consolidated net income 
changes in the difference between the indices used to mark to market our physical inventory gas daily and the related fair value hedge nymex can result in volatility in our reported net income  but  over time  gains and losses on the sale of storage gas inventory will be offset by gains and losses on the fair value hedges 
based upon our net physical position at september  and assuming our hedges would still 
table of contents qualify as highly effective  a change in the difference between the gas daily and nymex indices would impact our reported net income by approximately million 
additionally  these changes could cause us to recognize a risk management liability  which would require us to place cash into an escrow account to collateralize this liability position 
this  in turn  would reduce the amount of cash we would have on hand to fund our working capital needs 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates associated with our short term commercial paper program and other short term borrowings 
we use a sensitivity analysis to estimate our short term interest rate risk 
for purposes of this analysis  we estimate our short term interest rate risk as the difference between our actual interest expense for the period and estimated interest expense for the period assuming a hypothetical average one percent increase in the interest rates associated with our short term borrowings 
had interest rates associated with our short term borrowings increased by an average of one percent  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million during we also assess market risk for our fixed rate long term obligations 
we estimate market risk for our long term obligations as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates associated with these debt instruments 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis 
assuming this one percent hypothetical decrease  the fair value of our long term obligations would have increased by approximately million 
as of september   we were not engaged in other activities that would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices
