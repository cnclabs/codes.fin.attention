operations we own and operate the venetian  a renaissance venice themed resort situated on the las vegas strip the strip 
the venetian includes the first all suites hotel on the strip with  suites  a gaming facility of approximately  gross square feet  an enclosed retail  dining and entertainment complex of approximately  net leasable square feet the grand canal shops or the mall  which was sold to a third party in  a meeting and conference facility of approximately million square feet  and the sands expo center with approximately million square feet 
approximately of our gross revenue at the venetian for the year ended december  was derived from gaming and was derived from hotel rooms  food and beverage  and other sources 
the percentage of non gaming revenue for the venetian reflects the resort s emphasis on the group convention and trade show business and the resulting higher occupancy and room rates during mid week periods 
we also own and operate the sands macao  a las vegas style casino in macao  china  which opened on may  the sands macao now offers over  square feet of gaming facilities after our expansion  which was completed in august  as well as several restaurants  vip facilities  a theatre and other high end amenities 
in addition  we continue to progress according to plan on our expansion of the hotel tower  which we expect to complete during summer and to cost approximately million

in connection with the sale of the grand canal shops mall  we entered into an agreement with ggp  the purchaser of the grand canal shops mall  to sell ggp the phase ii mall upon completion of construction 
the purchase price that ggp has agreed to pay for the phase ii mall is the greater of i million and ii the phase ii mall s net operating income for months through of its operations

table of contents other development projects we are currently exploring the possibility of operating integrated resorts in additional asian jurisdictions  the united states and europe 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires our management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
these estimates and judgments are based on historical information  information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates and we may change our estimates and assumptions in future evaluations 
changes in these estimates and assumptions may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that the critical accounting policies discussed below affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance  or reserve  for doubtful accounts at our operating casino resorts  the venetian and the sands macao 
we regularly evaluate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at the venetian  where credit or marker play is significant  we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectibility of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount  based upon the age of the account  the customer s financial condition  collection history and any other known information 
we also monitor regional and global economic conditions and forecasts in our evaluation of the adequacy of the recorded reserves 
at the sands macao  where credit or marker play is not significant  we apply a standard reserve percentage to aged account balances 
the mix of credit play as a percentage of total casino play has decreased significantly since due to the continued growth of the sands macao where table games play is primarily cash play  while the venetian credit table games play represents approximately of total table games play 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was and of gross casino and hotel accounts receivable for the years ended december  and  respectively 
self insurance accruals we maintain accruals for health and workers compensation self insurance  which are classified in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating the historical experience and projected trends related to these accruals and in consultation with outside actuarial experts 
if such information indicates that the accruals are overstated or understated  or if business conditions indicate we should adjust the assumptions utilized  we will reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
litigation accrual we are subject to various claims and legal actions 
we estimate the accruals for these claims and legal actions in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and include such accruals in other accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
property and equipment at december   we had net property and equipment of billion  representing of our total assets 
we depreciate property and equipment on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
the estimated useful lives are based on the nature of the assets as well as current operating strategy and legal considerations such as contractual life 
future events  such as property expansions  property developments  new competition  or new regulations  could result in a change in the manner in which we use certain assets requiring a change in the estimated useful lives of such assets 

table of contents for assets to be held and used  fixed assets are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist 
if an indicator of impairment exists  the company first groups its assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group 
secondly  the company estimates the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise from the use of and eventual disposition of such asset group 
the company estimates the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group 
if the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value  no impairment is indicated 
if the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value  then an impairment is measured based on fair value compared to carrying value  with fair value typically based on a discounted cash flow model 
if an asset is still under development  future cash flows include remaining construction costs 
stock based compensation sfas no 
r  share based payment  requires the recognition of compensation expense in the consolidated statements of operations related to the fair value of employee stock based compensation 
determining the fair value of stock based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term that stock options will be outstanding prior to exercise  the associated volatility and the expected dividends 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatilities from a selection of companies from our peer group due to our lack of historical information 
we used the simplified method for estimating expected option life  as the options qualify as plain vanilla options 
we believe that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are appropriate in calculating the fair values of our stock options granted 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards expected to be forfeited prior to vesting 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from these estimates  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted 
prior to adopting sfas no 
r  we applied apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans 
all employee stock options were granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value as defined in the company s equity award plan 
the company adopted sfas no 
r effective january  during the year ended december   we recorded stock based compensation expense of million 
no such expense was recorded in and as of december   there was million of unrecognized compensation cost  net of estimated forfeitures of  related to nonvested stock options and there was million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested restricted stock 
the stock option and restricted stock costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years and years  respectively 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in the united states  and in several states and foreign jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on differences between financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of any applicable valuation allowances  related to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credits and other temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not  otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by the internal revenue service irs and other tax authorities 
while positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws  we do not take such positions unless we have substantial authority to do so under the internal revenue code and applicable regulations 
we may take positions on our tax returns based on substantial authority that are not ultimately accepted by the irs 
we assess potential unfavorable outcomes based on the criteria of sfas no 
we establish a tax reserve if an unfavorable outcome is probable and the amount of the unfavorable outcome can be reasonably estimated 
we assess the potential outcomes of tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis 
in determining whether the probable criterion of sfas no 
is met  we presume that the taxing authority will focus on the exposure and we assess the probable outcome of a particular issue based upon the relevant legal and technical merits 
we also apply our judgment regarding the potential actions by the tax authorities and resolution through the settlement process 

table of contents we maintain required tax reserves until such time as the underlying issue is resolved 
when actual results differ from reserve estimates  we will adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the period resolved 
for tax years that are examined by taxing authorities  we will adjust tax reserves in the year the tax examinations are settled 
for tax years that are not examined by taxing authorities  we will adjust tax reserves in the year that the statute of limitations expires 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached on emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 how sales collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation 
the eitf reached a consensus that the presentation of taxes on either a gross or net basis is an accounting policy decision that requires disclosure 
eitf issue no 
is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after december  taxes collected from the our customers are and have been recorded on a net basis 
we have no intention of modifying this accounting policy 
as such  the adoption of eitf issue no 
will not have an effect on our results from operations or financial position 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which provides guidance for the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
fin no 
provides guidance on the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin no 
also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures  and transition 
fin no 
will require entities to assess the likelihood that uncertain tax positions will be accepted by the applicable taxing authority and then measure the amount of benefit to be recognized for these purposes which are considered greater than likely to be sustained 
fin no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we will adopt fin no 
as of january   as required 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this standard  but believe that there will be a reduction to opening retained earnings in an amount that will not exceed million 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements and we do not expect the application of this standard to change its current practices 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years

table of contents percent of net revenues year ended december  operating expenses operating income income before income taxes net income our historical financial results during the years ended december  and will not be indicative of our future results  among other things  for the following items which are not anticipated to occur to this magnitude in the near future we sold the grand canal shops mall on may  and recognized a gain of million  we paid incentive payments of million related to the phase ii mall sale to certain of our executives in july  we incurred a loss on disposal of assets of million in related primarily to demolition of space to accommodate the construction of a showroom  we incurred a stock based compensation charge of million related to our initial public offering in  and we incurred a loss on retirement of debt of million during related to the redemption of the mortgage notes and vml s senior secured notes 
key operating revenue measurements the venetian s operating revenue is dependent upon the volume of customers who stay at the hotel  which affects the price that can be charged for hotel rooms and the volume of table games and slot machine play 
the sands macao is almost wholly dependent on casino customers that visit the casino on a daily basis 
hotel revenues are not material for the sands macao 
visitors to the sands macao arrive by ferry  automobile  bus  airplane or helicopter from hong kong  cities in china and other southeast asian cities in close proximity to macao 
the following are the key measurements we use to evaluate operating revenue casino revenue measurements for las vegas table games drop and slot handle are volume measurements 
win or hold percentage represents the percentage of drop or handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue 
table games drop represents the sum of markers issued credit instruments less markers paid at the table  plus cash deposited in the table drop box 
slot handle is the gross amount wagered or coin placed into slot machines in aggregate for the period cited 
drop and handle are abbreviations for table games drop and slot handle 
based upon our mix of table games  our table games produce a statistical average table win percentage calculated before discounts as measured as a percentage of table game drops of to and slot machines produce a statistical average slot machine win percentage calculated before slot club cash incentives as measured as a percentage of slot machine handle generally between and 
casino revenue measurements for macao we view macao table games as being segregated into two groups  consistent with the macao market s convention rolling chip play all vip play and non rolling chip play mostly non vip players 
the volume measurement for rolling chip play is non negotiable gaming chips wagered 
the volume measurement for non rolling chip is table games drop as described above 
rolling chip volume and non rolling chip volume are not equivalent because  since rolling chip volume is a measure of amounts wagered versus dropped  rolling chip volume is substantially higher than drop 
slot handle at the sands macao is the gross amount wagered or coins placed into slot machines in aggregate for the period cited 
we view rolling chip table games win as a percentage of rolling chip volume and we view non rolling chip table games win as a percentage of drop 
win or hold percentage represents the percentage of rolling chip volume  non rolling chip drop or slot handle that is won by the casino and recorded as casino revenue 
based upon our mix of table games in macao  our rolling chip table games win percentage calculated before discounts and commissions as measured as a percentage of rolling chip volume is expected to be to and our non rolling chip table games are expected to produce a statistical average table win percentage as measured as a percentage of table game drop before discounts and commissions of to 
similar to las vegas  our macao slot machines produce a statistical average slot machine win percentage as measured as a percentage of slot machine handle of generally between and 

table of contents actual win may vary from the statistical average 
generally  slot machine play at the venetian and the sands macao is conducted on a cash basis 
the venetian s table games revenue is approximately from credit based guests wagering for the year ended december  and the sands macao s table game play is conducted primarily on a cash basis 
hotel revenue measurements hotel occupancy rate  which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period  and average daily room rate  which is the average price of occupied rooms per day  are used as performance indicators 
revenue per available room represents a summary of hotel average daily room rates and occupancy 
because not all available rooms are occupied  average daily room rates are higher than revenue per available room 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  operating revenues our net revenues consisted of the following year ended december  percent change in thousands  except for percentages net revenues casino rooms food and beverage convention  retail and other less promotional allowances total net revenues consolidated net revenues were billion for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to billion for the year ended december  the increase in net revenues was due primarily to an increase in casino revenue of million 
this increase is primarily attributable to the growth of our operations at the sands macao due primarily to the formal introduction of our rolling chip program in march and the casino expansion in august casino revenues for the year ended december  increased million as compared the year ended december  of the increase  million was attributable to the growth of our casino operations at the

room revenues for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  the increase was attributable to the increase in the average daily room rate as well as a slight increase in the occupancy rate 
the following table summarizes the results of our room revenue activity year ended december  change the venetian average daily room rate occupancy rate 
pts revenue per available room food and beverage revenues were million for the year ended december   an increase of million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to food and beverage revenues at the venetian  which increased million due to increased group business resulting primarily from approximately  square feet of additional meeting space at the property 
convention  retail and other revenues for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  the increase in primarily attributable to million of additional convention revenues from the sands expo center and million in revenues associated with the blue man group  the phantom of the opera and the gordie brown performances  which began in october  june and october  respectively 

table of contents operating expenses the breakdown of operating expenses is as follows year ended december  percent change in thousands  except for percentages operating expenses casino rooms food and beverage convention  retail and other provision for doubtful accounts general and administrative corporate expense rental expense pre opening expense development expense depreciation and amortization loss on disposal of assets total operating expenses operating expenses were billion for the year ended december   an increase of million as compared to billion for the year ended december  the increase in operating expenses was primarily attributable to the higher operating revenues and growth of our operating businesses in macao and to a lesser extent in las vegas  as more fully described below 
casino department expenses for the year ended december  increased million as compared to the year ended december  of the increase in casino expenses  million was due to the gross win tax on casino revenues in macao 
despite the higher gross win tax  casino operating margins at the sands macao are similar to those at the venetian primarily because of lower labor  marketing and sales expenses in macao 
as the rolling chip volume increases as a percentage of our total gaming operations  casino margins will decrease due to the commissions paid under the rolling chip program 
the remaining increase was primarily attributable to the additional payroll related expenses related to the continued growth of our operations at the sands macao and the casino expansion in august food and beverage expense increased million and convention  retail and other expense increased million 
these increases were primarily due to the associated increase in the respective revenue categories as noted above 
the provision for doubtful accounts was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   due primarily to an increase in casino and hotel receivables during the year
