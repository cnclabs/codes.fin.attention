item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
in addition to historical information  this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under the caption risk factors in this filing 
overview background we are a specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the in licensing and development of proprietary product candidates for the treatment of diseases and disorders in the fields of psychiatry and neurology 
we have completed our phase clinical program for our lead product candidate  silenor tm doxepin hydrochloride for the treatment of insomnia 
we expect to file a new drug application  or nda  with the us food and drug administration  or fda  for silenor tm in the third quarter of  assuming that our ongoing preclinical studies requested by the fda proceed as currently scheduled 
we have also in licensed two additional product candidates 
we have completed a pilot phase clinical trial for nalmefene in smoking cessation with positive results 
we also completed a phase clinical trial for nalmefene for the treatment of pathological gambling that did not achieve statistical significance for the primary or secondary endpoints 
we are evaluating the results from both of these clinical trials before making determinations regarding the future of the nalmefene program 
we are also developing a new formulation of acamprosate calcium for the treatment of certain movement disorders 
we were incorporated in august and are a development stage company 
during  we focused on hiring our executive team and initial operating employees and on in licensing our first product candidate  silenor tm 
during  we initiated two phase clinical trials for silenor tm and entered into in license agreements for nalmefene and acamprosate 
during  we initiated phase clinical trials for silenor tm  commenced a phase clinical trial on nalmefene for the treatment of pathological gambling  initiated a pilot phase clinical trial for nalmefene for smoking cessation  and began working on a new formulation for acamprosate 
in december  we completed our initial public offering in which we issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share for gross proceeds of million  and net proceeds of million after deducting issuance costs of million 
in conjunction with the completion of our initial public offering  all outstanding shares of convertible preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock 
during  we completed four phase clinical trials for silenor tm which demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements across multiple endpoints measuring sleep onset  sleep maintenance and sleep duration 
based on a request we received in july from the us food and drug administration  or fda  we initiated a preclinical program for silenor tm consisting of standard genotoxicity  reproductive toxicology and carcinogenicity studies 
in september  we completed the genotoxicity studies and no signal indicative of genotoxicity was found in any of the assays 
reproductive toxicology studies are underway and are expected to be completed in the middle of we have also commenced dose finding studies in preparation for our carcinogenicity studies 
the fda indicated that the data from the genotoxicity studies and reproductive toxicology studies should be included in the nda for silenor tm 
the fda also indicated that depending on the outcome of the genotoxicity studies  it may be flexible as to the timing of the conduct of the carcinogenicity studies  including the potential that the data from those studies may be submitted as a post nda approval commitment 
we submitted the results of the genotoxicity studies to the fda in september in recent correspondence  the fda agreed with our assessment that silenor tm does not appear to have genotoxic potential 
the fda indicated that  unless other preclinical data raise a concern  a complete assessment of the carcinogenic potential of silenor tm may not be needed prior to nda approval 
the fda also indicated that it may accept the results of a shorter term carcinogenicity study for approval of the nda and allow the standard two year carcinogenicity study to be completed as a phase commitment 
we are exploring the subject of a shorter term carcinogenicity study which we believe could be completed by the first half of 
table of contents in july  we announced the results from our pilot phase clinical trial evaluating the use of nalmefene for smoking cessation 
in this trial  nalmefene demonstrated numerically higher smoking abstinence rates relative to placebo and incidences of adverse events were comparable to those observed in clinical trials previously conducted with nalmefene 
in december  we completed our phase clinical trial evaluating nalmefene for the treatment of pathological gambling 
nalmefene did not demonstrate a statistically significant difference compared to placebo and the most frequently reported adverse events were insomnia  nausea and dizziness 
elevation in liver enzymes was observed in some nalmefene treated patients 
we are evaluating the results from both of these clinical trials before making determinations regarding the future of the nalmefene program 
in the first quarter of we entered into a product formulation and development agreement to develop an improved  patent protected form of acamprosate 
acamprosate is a compound characterized by poor bioavailability 
as a result  the approved form of acamprosate requires patients to take two tablets  three times a day for the current indication 
if a formulation is achieved that can significantly reduce the amount of drug required to demonstrate a clinical effect  it may result in less frequent and or lower dosages 
we have selected several formulations  and are conducting a phase clinical trial that we expect to complete during we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect our accumulated deficit to continue to increase for the next several years as we pursue the clinical development and market launch of our silenor tm and selectively pursue development of our other product candidates 
revenues we have not generated any revenues to date  and we do not expect to generate any revenues from licensing  achievement of milestones  or product sales until we enter into a strategic collaboration or are able to commercialize silenor tm ourselves 
license fees our license fees consist of the costs incurred to in license our product candidates 
we charge all license fees and milestone payments for acquired development and commercialization rights to operations as incurred since the underlying technology associated with these expenditures relates to our research and development efforts and has no alternative future use 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with preclinical studies and clinical trials managed by our clinical research organizations  or cros  costs associated with non clinical activities  such as regulatory expenses  salaries and related employee benefits  as well as share based compensation expense 
our most significant costs incurred to date relate to conducting our clinical trials for silenor tm 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we expect our research and development expenses to remain a significant component of our operating expenses in the future as we continue our preclinical studies and file our nda for silenor tm  selectively further the development our other product candidates and if we in license additional product candidates 
we use our internal research and development resources across several projects and many resources are not attributable to specific projects 
accordingly  we do not account for our internal research and development costs on a project basis 
we use external service providers to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials and to manufacture the product candidates used in our studies 
these external costs are tracked on a project basis and are expensed as incurred 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the filing of our planned nda for silenor tm and preclinical and clinical development process  and given the nature of our product development programs  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs we will incur in the regulatory filing process and continued development of our product candidates for potential commercialization 
preclinical and clinical development timelines  the probability of success and development costs vary widely 
the lengthy process of completing preclinical testing  seeking 
table of contents regulatory approval  and conducting clinical trials for our product candidates requires the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us or delay in obtaining regulatory approval  or completing preclinical testing or clinical trials  would cause our research and development expense to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or other strategic transactions  when such arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
as a result  we cannot be certain when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our product candidates or collaboration agreements  if at all 
marketing  general and administrative our marketing  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits  share based compensation expense  advertising  market research costs  insurance and facility costs  and professional fees related to our administrative  finance  human resources  legal and internal systems support functions 
we anticipate increases in marketing  general and administrative expenses as we add personnel  comply with obligations applicable to publicly held companies  and continue to develop and prepare for the commercialization of silenor tm 
remeasurement of series c warrant liability in conjunction with our series c redeemable convertible preferred stock financing in june  we issued a warrant that provided for the sale of additional shares of redeemable preferred stock at the election either by us or the series c preferred stock investors 
the warrant instrument was treated as a net liability and periodically remeasured to its fair value with corresponding expense or income recognized within operating expenses 
in september  we exercised our right to require the series c preferred stock investors to purchase additional shares of series c preferred stock 
immediately prior to exercise  the value of the warrant was remeasured to its fair value  resulting in total expense relating to the warrant of million for the year ended december  because the series c warrant was exercised  we will not record any future remeasurement of the series c warrant liability in future periods 
interest and other income interest and other income consist primarily of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
clinical trial expenses expenditures relating to clinical trials and studies are expensed as incurred and included within research and development expenses 
our clinical trial and study expenses are based on estimates of the services received and efforts expended to date pursuant to contracts with research institutions  cros and other vendors that conduct and manage clinical trials and studies on our behalf 
measurement of clinical trial and study expenses require judgment as we may not have been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual costs  making it necessary to estimate the efforts completed to date and the related expense 
the period over which services are performed  the level of services performed as of a given date  and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
our principal vendors operate within terms of contracts which establish program costs and estimated timelines 
we assess the 
table of contents status of our programs through regular discussions between our program management team and the related vendors 
based on these assessments  we determine the progress of our programs in relation to the scope of work outlined in the contracts  and recognize the related amount of expense accordingly 
we adjust our estimates as actual costs become known to us 
changes in estimates could materially affect our results of operations 
license fees costs related to patents and acquisition of intellectual property are expensed as incurred since the underlying technology associated with these expenditures is in connection with our development efforts and has no alternative future use 
certain of our in license agreements contain provisions which obligate us to make milestone payments or provide other consideration if specified events occur 
determining whether these events will occur  and the timing of such events  requires judgment on the part of management 
the subjective nature of these estimates can make it difficult to determine the extent to which a milestone obligation may be earned  and the period to which the related expense will apply 
share based compensation on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense in the statement of operations for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options  based on estimated fair values 
prior to adopting sfas no 
r  we accounted for share based awards to employees and directors using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principals board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb  and provided pro forma disclosure of net income loss as if a fair value method had been applied in measuring compensation expense in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic value method  deferred stock compensation was recognized to the extent that the price of the underlying common stock at the date of grant  as determined in our retrospective fair value analysis performed in conjunction with our initial public offering  exceeded the exercise price of the stock options 
measurement and recognition of share based compensation involves significant estimates and the use of an option valuation model  such as the black scholes model which we use 
determining the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by many complex and subjective assumptions  including estimates of our future volatility  employee exercise behavior  and the number of options expected to ultimately vest 
our expected future volatility is based on the volatility of comparable companies since the volatility of our own stock price has minimal observable history as a result of our recent initial public offering in december we applied the guidance in the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
in estimating the expected service period for our options 
share based compensation recorded in our statement of operations is based on awards expected to ultimately vest and has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
the value of options which ultimately vest is recorded as such amounts become known in future periods 
net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards we have incurred significant net operating losses to date which have resulted in net operating loss carryforwards which begin to expire years after being generated for federal purposes and years after being generated for california tax purposes 
we also have research and development credits which begin to expire years after being generated for federal purposes  and do not expire for california tax purposes 
we have fully reserved our net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits until such time that it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
pursuant to sections and of the internal revenue code  annual use of our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be limited in the event a cumulative change in ownership of more than occurs within a three year period 
we determined that such an ownership change occurred as of june  as a result of various stock issuances used to finance our development activities 
this ownership change resulted in limitations on the utilization of tax attributes  including net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
we estimate that million of our california net operating loss carryforwards were effectively eliminated and million of our federal and million of our state net operating loss carryforwards were subject to 
table of contents limitation 
an additional million of our federal research and development credits were also subject to limitation 
a portion of the limited net operating loss carryforwards becomes available for use each year 
we estimate that approximately million of the restricted net operating loss carryforwards become available each year between and  decreasing to approximately million thereafter 
net operating loss carryforwards and research and development credits generated subsequent to the ownership change are currently not subject to limitations  but could be subject to limitations in the future if additional ownership changes occur

our higher cash and investment balances  along with higher interest rates earned on our cash and investments during compared to  created an increase in our interest income 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  our operations have been financed through the private placement of equity securities and our initial public offering 
through december   we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale of shares of our preferred and common stock as follows from august to january  we issued and sold a total of  shares of series a preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  from april to june  we issued and sold  shares of series b preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in june  we issued and sold a total of  shares of series c preferred stock for aggregate net proceeds of million  in september  the series c warrant was exercised and we issued  shares of series c preferred stock for net proceeds of million  and in december  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock for aggregate net proceeds of million in our initial public offering 
in conjunction with our initial public offering  all of our outstanding shares of preferred stock were converted into  shares of common stock 
as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents and investments 
we have invested a substantial portion of our available cash funds in commercial paper  united states securities  and money market funds placed with reputable financial institutions for which credit loss is not anticipated 
we have established guidelines relating to credit rating  diversification and maturities of our investments to preserve principal and maintain liquidity 

table of contents for the year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net cash used in operating activities was due primarily to an increase in our net loss as a result of increased expenses related to the clinical development of silenor tm and nalmefene and increased salaries and overhead of our personnel 
we cannot be certain if  when  or to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization of our product candidates 
we expect our operating expenses to be substantial over the next few years as we seek to continue the advancement and commercialization of silenor tm  as well as selectively further the development of our other product candidates 
we have entered into several license agreements to acquire the rights to develop and commercialize three product candidates 
pursuant to these agreements  we obtained exclusive  sub licenseable rights to the patents and know how for certain indications 
we generally are required to make upfront payments as well as additional payments upon the achievement of specific development and regulatory approval milestones 
we are also obligated to pay royalties under the agreements until the later of the expiration of the applicable patent or the applicable last date of market exclusivity following the first commercial sale 
the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash as of december  payments due by period through through after total in thousands operating lease obligations minimum payments under license agreements total in addition  under our license agreements we are obligated to make revenue based royalty payments as well as additional milestone payments of up to million upon the occurrence of certain product development events  the majority of which pertains to nalmefene 
we are assessing the results from the nalmefene pathological gambling and smoking cessation clinical trials before making a determination regarding the future of the nalmefene program 
if the nalmefene program is not continued  a significant amount of the million of milestones would not be paid 
minimum license payments are subject to increase based on the timing of various milestones and the extent to which the licensed technologies are pursued for other indications 
these milestone payments and royalty payments under our license agreements are not included in the table above because we cannot  at this time  determine when or if the related milestones will be achieved or the events triggering the commencement of payment obligations will occur 
we also enter into agreements with third parties to manufacture our product candidates  conduct our clinical trials  and perform data collection and analysis 
our payment obligations under these agreements depend upon the progress of our development programs 
therefore  we are unable to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur under these agreements 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the progress of our clinical trials and studies  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish  including milestone payments to procom one  biotie therapies and or synchroneuron  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  the costs of establishing manufacturing  sales or distribution capabilities  
table of contents the success of the commercialization of our products  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 
we believe that our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements into the middle of until we can generate significant cash from our operations  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities 
in addition  we may finance future cash needs through the sale of other equity securities  debt financing  strategic collaborations or other strategic transactions 
we have an effective shelf registration statement on form s on file with the securities and exchange commission 
this registration statement could allow us to obtain additional financing of up to million 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining additional financing  entering into collaboration agreements or other strategic transactions  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate  or that additional financing will be available when needed  or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs  relinquish some or even all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development  or renegotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin defines the criterion an uncertain tax benefit position must meet for it to be recognized 
additionally  fin provides guidance on measurement of the amount to be recognized or derecognized  treatment of interest and penalties  and balance sheet classification and disclosures 
this interpretation is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and will first be effective for us for the year beginning january  we are in the process of analyzing the effects of this pronouncement 
since we have a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  no net effect on our deferred tax balances is expected  however  changes in the value of the components of our deferred tax assets may result from the adoption of fin in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard  or sfas  no 
 fair value measurement 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements  but rather applies to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines and establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and will first be effective for us for the year beginning january  we are in the process of analyzing the effects of this pronouncement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and investments at december  consisted primarily of money market funds  commercial paper and us government agency and corporate notes 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper  money market funds 
table of contents and government and corporate debt securities  all with various maturities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate
