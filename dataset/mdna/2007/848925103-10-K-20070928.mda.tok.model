the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and notes thereto 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states  which require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures 
a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in the footnotes to the financial statements included in this report on form k for the fiscal year ended june  the estimates used by management are based upon our historical experiences combined with management s understanding of current facts and circumstances 
certain of our accounting policies are considered critical as they are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and the results of our operations and require significant or complex judgments on the part of management 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
inventories our inventories  predominately comprised of finished goods  are generally valued at the lower of cost weighted average or market 
costs include amounts paid to suppliers for packaged apparel and or materials and labor  import costs  such as customs duties  freight in and other miscellaneous costs  and allocated overhead 
excess fashion apparel inventories  consisting of discontinued or aging merchandise  are a natural component of a seasonal apparel business 
while certain fashion apparel items will sell out in any particular selling season  quantities of other fashion apparel items will remain at the end of each selling season 
we market excess fashion apparel finished goods inventories at reduced wholesale prices to our customers in the normal course of business 
remaining excess inventories are liquidated through other markets 
in the ordinary course of business  we maintain reserves for inventory write downs due to the obsolescence of excess inventories 
we perform analyses on a quarterly basis to identify unsold excess inventories and adjust our reserves for inventory obsolescence to reduce the carrying value of excess inventories to their estimated net realizable value  which is estimated based on management s disposition plans and historical experiences 
generally  branded apparel inventories are not prone to impairment  because we usually order branded apparel in quantities per specific customer orders 
during fiscal  we recorded fashion apparel inventories write downs of  including a write down of  during the fourth fiscal quarter 
we did not record any write downs with regard to branded apparel during fiscal while management believes that our processes produce fair valuations of obsolete inventories  if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional allowances may be required 
deferred income taxes deferred income taxes are recognized for the expected tax consequences in future years for differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts  based upon enacted tax laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
our significant deferred tax assets are related to net operating loss carry forwards for federal and state income tax purposes  stock based compensation and an unrealized loss for tax purposes on a common stock investment 
governing regulations require that our operating losses be carried forward for income tax purposes 
we maintain a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the net amount expected to be recovered in future periods 
the estimates for deferred tax assets and the corresponding valuation allowance require us to exercise complex judgments 
we periodically review and adjust those estimates based upon the most current information available 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  and based upon a review at june   of our utilization of deferred tax assets  we maintained a valuation allowance that effectively reduces our net deferred tax assets to zero 
while we continue to explore various strategies to return the company to profitability  including finding additional markets for our top flite branded apparel  we cannot be certain that our efforts will result in the generation of future profits 
because the recoverability of deferred tax assets is directly dependent upon future operating results  actual recoverability of deferred tax assets may differ materially from our estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts reflects a reserve that reduces our customer accounts receivable to the net amount estimated to be collectible 
estimating the credit worthiness of customers and the recoverability of customer accounts requires us to exercise considerable judgment 
in estimating the reserve for uncollectible accounts  we consider factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions  historical and anticipated customer performance 
from time to time  we also identify delinquent customer accounts for which a specific reserve is required 
at june   our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled  including a specific reserve of  with respect to the potential non recovery of a net amount due to reserve apparel from a former inventory broker 
while we consider our processes to be adequate to effectively quantify our exposure to doubtful accounts  changes in economic  industry or specific customer conditions may result in recoverability of our doubtful accounts that differs materially from our estimates 
allowance for sales returns we record allowances for sales returns as net adjustments to customer accounts receivable 
when recording an allowance  the net method reduces customer accounts receivable and net sales by the estimated gross margin effect of the anticipated sales return 
generally  our selling terms preclude return of our products subsequent to the sale 
however  we have traditionally maintained limited programs that offer various customers the right to return certain fashion apparel items under predefined conditions  which we include as a component within our estimate of allowance for sales returns 
we review historical data and consider factors such as general economic and industry specific conditions and anticipated customer performance when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for sales returns 
at june   our allowance for sales returns was  significant changes in general economic or industry conditions may yield sales returns that differ materially from our estimates 
recent developments in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas permits an entity to measure financial instruments and certain other items at estimated fair value as of specific election dates 
the fair value option i may generally be applied instrument by instrument  ii is irrevocable unless a new election date occurs  and  iii must be applied to the entire instrument and not to only a portion of the instrument 
most of the provisions of sfas are elective 
however  the amendment to sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  applies to all entities that own securities that are classified as trading or available for sale 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption of sfas is permitted if the entity i chooses early adoption within the first days of its fiscal year  ii has not yet issued financial statements for any interim period of such fiscal year  and iii elects to apply the provisions of fasb no 
 fair value measurements 
we have not determined whether we will elect early adoption  and we have not evaluated the impact  if any  on our financial condition or the results of our operations that may be caused by our adoption of sfas in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
fin requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in an income tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
only tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold at the effective date may be recognized upon adoption of fin we are required to adopt fin effective july  the cumulative effect of initial adoption of fin  if any  will be recorded as an adjustment to beginning retained earnings in the year of adoption and will be presented separately 
we are currently evaluating the impact that fin will have on our financial condition and the results of our operations 
we have reviewed all other recently issued  but not yet effective  accounting pronouncements and do not believe the future adoption of any such pronouncements may be expected to cause a material impact on our financial condition or the results of our operations 
results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by items included in or derived from our statements of income for fiscal years ended june   and  and the consolidated statements of operations data for the fiscal years ended june  and  include the amounts of sport haley and reserve apparel 
fiscal year ended june  and consolidated results of operations data net sales total cost of goods sold gross profit total other operating costs loss from operations other income and expenses  net loss from operations before minority interest in subsidiary loss and provision for benefit from income taxes minority interest in subsidiary income loss provision for benefit from income taxes net loss comparison of fiscal years ended june  and total net sales for fiscal were  a decrease of  or  as compared with sales of  for fiscal net sales of fashion apparel for fiscal were  a decrease of  or  as compared with fashion apparel sales of  for fiscal net sales of branded apparel for fiscal were  a decrease of  or  as compared with branded apparel sales of  for fiscal the remainder of our net sales for fiscal and were comprised of embroidery and shipping revenues 
our consolidated gross margins may not be comparable to other companies within the golf apparel industry 
we have consistently included the cost of merchandise sold  including import charges  in bound freight  allocated overhead  freight out  embroidery costs and other charges in our cost of goods sold 
our overhead allocation includes our production costs plus a portion of our distribution costs  such as receiving and inspection costs  but we include some of the other costs of distribution  such as a portion of our warehousing and other handling costs  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our gross margins also include  on a consolidated basis  the operations of reserve apparel  which distributes top flite branded apparel to the mass retail market at much lower price points and gross margins than those expected to be achieved in the premium and mid price markets where we distribute our sport haley and ben hogan fashion apparel brands 
other fashion apparel companies within the golf industry may or may not also operate within the lower price markets 
we include royalty payments  relating to sales of licensed apparel  in selling  general and administrative expenses 
fashion apparel for fiscal  net sales of sport haley women s fashion apparel were  an increase of  or  from net sales of  for fiscal we believe that the shrinking market for women s fashion golf apparel bottomed out in  as evidenced not only by our increase in net sales of women s fashion apparel in fiscal but also because we continue to experience increases in advance orders for our women s collections 
we believe that the continued increase in advance orders indicates that the trend of increasing sales of women s apparel will continue throughout fiscal for fiscal  net sales of ben hogan men s fashion apparel were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  for fiscal we attribute the decrease primarily to changes in the country club and resort markets in which we operate 
historically  the country club and resort markets preferred to sell high quality apparel that was not broadly distributed in other retail markets 
however  with the introduction and broad market acceptance of moisture wicking and other performance garments within golf apparel markets  country clubs and resorts have begun to carry apparel brands such as nike and adidas  which are primarily comprised of performance fabrics and are globally distributed into numerous markets other than country clubs and resorts 
we believe that the penetration of nike and adidas into golf apparel markets has diluted the value with regard to the exclusivity of brands such as our ben hogan fashion apparel brand  at least on a temporary basis 
in order to bolster future sales of our ben hogan fashion apparel  we have concentrated our marketing efforts to upscale retail stores and to corporate markets 
we expect that our efforts will at a minimum generate sales of ben hogan fashion apparel to two or three new upscale retail stores in fiscal ben hogan men s fashion apparel is marketed in accordance with a license agreement we maintain with callaway  which we consider to be a key component of our overall business strategies 
as a percentage of sales  gross profit of our fashion apparel was for fiscal and was for fiscal gross profit of fashion apparel has remained relatively unchanged since fiscal primarily because we recorded comparatively similar write downs of fashion apparel inventories in fiscal and  and because negotiated prices for finished apparel purchased from foreign suppliers have remained relatively constant over the same period 
excess inventories are common within the fashion apparel industry 
we market excess fashion apparel inventories at reduced wholesale prices to our customers in the normal course of business 
remaining excess inventories are liquidated through other markets 
the valuation of excess inventories  when the market price for such inventories is lower than cost  negatively impacts our gross profit percentage  because a reduction of inventory value causes a corresponding increase in our cost of goods sold  thereby reducing our gross profit 
gross profit with regard to our fashion apparel was negatively impacted by  and  for fiscal and  respectively  by the adjustment of our finished goods inventories to the lower of cost or market 
the disposition of excess inventories also negatively impacts our gross profit percentage  even when such inventories are properly valued to the lower of cost or market  because such valuation causes sales to be recorded with gross profit at or near zero 
in fiscal  we recorded net sales of  and loss of  with regard to the disposition of excess fashion apparel inventories 
comparatively  in fiscal  we recorded net sales of  and loss of  with regard to the disposition of excess fashion apparel inventories 
selling  general and administrative expenses with regard to fashion apparel were  for fiscal  an increase of  or  from  in fiscal during fiscal  comparative increases in advertising and personnel expenses were partially offset by comparative decreases in insurance  legal and investment banking expenses 
the increase in advertising expenses primarily related to expanding our participation in various golf or retail related tradeshows throughout the fiscal year 
the increase in personnel expenses included comparatively higher salaries paid to our chief executive and other officers and key employees during fiscal as compared with fiscal plus salary and benefits with regard to a person we hired in august to implement corporate sales initiatives to potentially bolster sales of fashion apparel 
the comparative decrease in insurance expenses primarily related to decreased premiums for directors and officers insurance coverage 
legal and investment banking expenses declined primarily because  in fiscal  after we completed the self tender offer as a means of increasing shareholder value  we for the time being suspended our efforts to pursue strategic alternatives including but not limited to selling the company  seeking joint venture partners  engaging in recapitalization  reviving our stock repurchase plan or pursuing another extraordinary transaction such as taking the company private 
as a percentage of net fashion apparel sales  related selling  general and administrative expenses were for fiscal as compared with for fiscal we recorded royalty expense of  for fiscal  a decrease of  or  as compared with royalty expense of  for fiscal the decrease in royalty expense generally corresponds to the decrease in sales of ben hogan fashion apparel over the comparative period 
royalty expense with regard to fashion apparel is due to callaway in accordance with the license they previously granted us to market men s fashion apparel bearing the ben hogan label 
historically  our sales have generated royalties which have consistently exceeded the minimum annual royalties required by the license agreement with regard to ben hogan fashion apparel 
as previously reported  in september  we recorded goodwill of  with regard to our purchase of the minority interest in reserve apparel from explorer gear 
at june   we determined that the goodwill was sufficiently impaired per the guidance offered by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  to warrant impairing the entire balance  because since purchasing the minority interest we have been unable to locate a significant customer for our top flite apparel 
primarily due to the factors discussed above  income loss from operations with regard to fashion apparel was  for fiscal  a difference of  or  from  for fiscal branded apparel we have considered top flite branded apparel  which we market pursuant to our licensing agreement with callaway for such apparel  to be a key component in our overall business strategies  designed to return the company to sustained profitability 
net sales of top flite branded apparel for fiscal were  including sales to wal mart of  we began shipping top flite branded apparel exclusively to wal mart in march  and we recorded sales of  to wal mart in fiscal as previously reported  in late september  wal mart discontinued purchasing top flite branded apparel from us  opting instead to develop a line of golf apparel under a private label 
throughout fiscal  we redesigned our top flite apparel collection to include garments primarily comprised of a variety of performance fabrics  and we aggressively marketed the redesigned top flite branded apparel to a number of other mass retailers and certain big box type high sales volume retail stores 
to date  we have received an order for top flite apparel from one such retailer for a test in of its stores  which we began to deliver in september while our intensive marketing efforts have continued  we are not certain that we will be able to obtain any other significant customers for top flite branded apparel for the remainder of fiscal our distribution of top flite branded apparel to the mass retail market generally generates gross margins lower than those expected to be achieved in the premium and mid price markets where we distribute our sport haley and ben hogan fashion apparel brands 
branded apparel is generally sold at much lower prices than for higher quality fashion apparel  and gross margins are also expected to be lower for branded apparel than for fashion apparel 
other companies within the golf apparel industry may or may not operate within the lower price branded apparel markets 
as a percentage of net branded apparel sales  gross margins with respect to sales of branded apparel were and for fiscal and  respectively 
as previously reported  gross margins of top flite branded apparel sales for fiscal were negatively impacted by production delays  extraordinary shipping charges and mark down money paid to wal mart 
we did not incur any such unexpected extraordinary expenses in fiscal gross margins achieved in fiscal with respect to branded apparel sales were more in line with management expectations than gross margins achieved in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses were  with regard to branded apparel for fiscal  a decrease of  or  from  for fiscal  primarily due to differences between the fiscal years in allocated management costs  which totaled  in fiscal versus  in fiscal the  decrease in allocated management costs related to changes in the ownership of reserve apparel and the loss of the wal mart account 
prior to our purchase of the minority interest in reserve apparel from explorer gear in september  allocated management costs included a portion of sport haley s costs with regard to managing reserve apparel and certain reimbursable expenses incurred by explorer gear on behalf of reserve apparel 
because wal mart ceased purchasing top flite branded apparel from us shortly after we purchased the minority interest  the business operations of reserve apparel were significantly reduced and we discontinued our allocation of sport haley management costs to reserve apparel 
fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses with regard to branded apparel included wages and benefits of  paid to a person we hired in november to actively market top flite branded apparel to the mass retail and big box market suitable for such apparel 
prior to november  this person provided consulting services to us with regard to marketing our branded apparel to wal mart and other mass retailers from approximately may to october selling  general and administrative expenses with regard to branded apparel in fiscal also included travel and other costs related to our marketing efforts and expenses related to our participation in various industry related tradeshows 
as a percentage of net branded apparel sales  related selling  general and administrative expenses were for fiscal and were for fiscal we recorded royalty expense of  and  with regard to top flite branded apparel for fiscal and  respectively 
royalty expense is due to callaway in accordance with the license they previously granted us to market branded apparel bearing the top flite label 
because we anticipated that sales of top flite branded apparel would be insufficient to meet the contractual minimum royalty requirement of  for calendar for such apparel  we accrued a contingent liability and royalty expense of  at june  the remainder of our fiscal royalty expense with regard to branded apparel related to sales of top flite apparel that we recorded during the three months ended september  sales of top flite branded apparel were sufficient to meet the minimum royalty requirement under the license agreement for calendar primarily due the factors listed above  income loss from operations with regard to branded apparel for fiscal was  an improvement of  or  from  for fiscal other income total other income  net  for fiscal was  a decrease of  or  from  for fiscal historically  our other income  net  has been comprised of interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances held at various financial institutions 
interest earned on cash and cash equivalent balances remained nearly constant between fiscal and other income  net  for fiscal included  of the  recovered in the settlement we reached with our auditors from prior to fiscal we offset legal expenses for fiscal with the remainder of the settlement amount of net income loss net loss for fiscal was  a difference of  or  from  for fiscal we had federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of  and  at june   that we estimated may be recoverable at income tax rates of and  respectively 
in accordance with sfas and based upon a review at june   of our utilization of deferred tax assets  we maintained a valuation allowance that effectively reduces our net deferred tax assets to zero 
while we continue to explore various strategies to return the company to profitability  including expanding our sport haley and ben hogan fashion apparel distribution channels within retail and corporate markets and finding alternative markets for our top flite branded apparel  we cannot be certain that our efforts will result in the generation of future profits sufficient to offset our net operation loss carry forwards prior to their expirations 
accordingly  we did not record benefits from income taxes associated with the corresponding losses for fiscal or earnings loss per share basic and diluted loss per common share were and for fiscal and  respectively 
all securities options were anti dilutive and therefore excluded from the per share calculations with respect to periods in which net losses were incurred 
book value our book value per common share was at june   and was at june  comparison of fiscal years ended june  and total net sales for fiscal were  a decrease of  or  as compared with sales of  for fiscal net sales of fashion apparel for fiscal were  a decrease of  or  as compared with fashion apparel sales of  for fiscal net sales of branded apparel for fiscal were  for fiscal  net sales of ben hogan apparel collections were  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  in fiscal  and net sales of sport haley apparel collections were  for fiscal  a decrease of  or  from net sales of  for fiscal in fiscal  we marketed top flite apparel exclusively to wal mart  and net sales of top flite branded apparel were  for fiscal we began shipping top flite branded apparel to wal mart in march the market for women s golf apparel appeared to have been shrunk for a couple of years through fiscal  which caused fierce competition among the brands vying for limited shelf space within the market 
we were disappointed with the continued decrease in sales of our women s fashion apparel collections  but we believed that the shrinking market may have bottomed out  and we anticipated that our sales of women s apparel would begin to increase slightly in future periods beyond fiscal sport haley continued to be a highly recognized brand within the women s apparel market  and at the end of fiscal we continued to develop plans to improve the strategic position of the sport haley brand within the women s market 
because net sales of ben hogan apparel collections appeared to have begun to flatten out  we implemented initiatives in fiscal to bolster our overall fashion apparel sales 
in fiscal  we hired a western regional sales manager with extensive experience within the golf apparel industry in the western geographical regions of the united states and hawaii 
we believed that the western regional manager complemented the talents of our eastern regional manager  who has a similar amount of experience within the golf apparel industry in the eastern geographical regions of the united states 
our regional sales managers are responsible for maximizing our fashion apparel sales within their respective geographical regions by training and supervising our independent wholesale sales representatives and maintaining contacts with key accounts 
in fiscal  we also hired a customer service liaison with extensive marketing experience within the golf apparel industry to provide white glove service to our key accounts and to help us market our sport haley and ben hogan fashion apparel brands to prestigious country clubs and resorts which had not done business with us in the past 
gross profit for fiscal was  an increase of  or  as compared with gross profit for fiscal of  the difference between the fiscal years was partially attributable to lower write downs of fashion apparel inventories in fiscal as compared with fiscal write downs of fashion apparel inventories negatively impacted our gross margins by  in fiscal as compared with write downs of  in fiscal the difference between the fiscal years was also partially attributable to consolidating sales of fashion apparel with sales of branded apparel in fiscal gross profit for fiscal with regard to sales of branded apparel was  which yielded a gross margin on branded apparel net sales for the respective period 
we expected that our sales of top flite branded apparel should yield gross margins of or greater 
gross profit relating to top flite branded apparel sales for fiscal was negatively impacted by production delays  extraordinary shipping charges and mark down money due to wal mart 
production delays caused us to incur inbound freight charges of  because the top flite merchandise was continually received late from our suppliers  wal mart required that we ship the orders directly to each store rather than to respective wal mart distribution centers as originally planned 
we estimated that additional shipping costs  incurred to ship orders directly to wal mart stores rather than to distribution centers  were in excess of  for fiscal periodically  per our vendor agreement  wal mart reserves the right to request that we reimburse them for mark downs they have taken or plan to take on top flite apparel we sold to them 
it is our understanding that wal mart typically requests mark down money when sales of merchandise do not reasonably meet their internal expectations 
because we shipped top flite apparel for a father s day promotion five weeks late due to production delays  wal mart lost early sales opportunities for the merchandise  and sell through of the top flite apparel produced for that promotion did not reasonably meet their expectations 
we recorded sales discounts of  in fiscal relating to mark down concessions granted to wal mart with respect to the father s day promotion that adversely affected our gross profit  accordingly 
by june   we consolidated the operations of reserve apparel to move substantially all of its operations to our denver  colorado facility 
before moving the operations to denver  the product development  sourcing  logistics and sales invoicing operations of reserve apparel had been performed in toronto  ontario  canada  by employees of explorer gear  the former minority interest 
by consolidating the operations of reserve apparel into our denver operations  and utilizing suppliers other than those which caused repeated production delays  we expected to improve the management of the entire production process and to achieve more reasonable margins on sales of top flite branded apparel in periods beyond fiscal wal mart informed us in september that they no longer intend to purchase top flite branded apparel 
selling  general and administrative expenses were  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  from  in fiscal the decrease was attributable to various factors 
included in fiscal expenses were severance and other compensation expenses paid to our late chairman and former chief executive officer 
subsequent to the death of our chairman in september  we paid  in severance and other compensation to the late chairman s estate 
similarly  upon the departure of our former chief executive officer in october  we accrued  in severance and other compensation that is generally payable to the former executive over a three year period ending in march the severance and other compensation amounts paid to our late chairman and former chief executive officer increased our selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal by  the severance and other compensation expense paid to our former chief executive officer had no effect on our selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal salary and other payroll related expenses  net of severance and other compensation costs  totaled  in fiscal  a decrease of  or  from  in fiscal we attributed the remainder of the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses to our continued efforts to streamline our operations and to find additional ways to decrease our overall operating expenses 
as a percentage of sales  our selling  general and administrative expenses were and for fiscal and  respectively 
royalty expense for fiscal was  an increase of  or  from  for fiscal the increase in royalty expense was primarily attributable to the introduction of top flite branded apparel in fiscal royalty expense is due to callaway in accordance with the license agreement they previously granted to us to market golf apparel bearing the ben hogan and top flite labels 
total other income  net  for fiscal was  an increase of  or  from  in fiscal the increase in other income  net  was primarily attributable to higher rates of interest earned during fiscal as compared with fiscal on cash and cash equivalent balances held at various financial institutions 
other income for fiscal also included  of the  recovered in the settlement we reached with our auditors from prior to fiscal we offset legal expenses for fiscal with the remainder of the settlement in the amount of  loss from operations before minority interest in subsidiary loss and provision for income taxes for fiscal was  an improvement of  or  from a loss of  in fiscal while a substantial amount of the improvement was due to the factors discussed above  such as better controls over fashion apparel inventories that resulted in lower write downs of obsolete or discontinued inventories in fiscal  severance and other compensation expense incurred in fiscal and not in fiscal  lower overall payroll and related expenses in fiscal  higher rates of interest earned on cash and cash equivalents in fiscal and the settlement recovery from our former auditors in fiscal  we believed that the improvement was also indicative of management s concerted efforts to return the company to profitability 
of the  loss incurred in fiscal  only  related to the operations of sport haley  as compared with  in fiscal the remaining  of the  fiscal loss was attributable to the operations of reserve apparel 
basic and diluted losses per share were and for fiscal years and  respectively 
due to the net losses for the respective periods  all outstanding options were anti dilutive and therefore excluded from the loss per share calculations 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are derived from our available cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and a revolving line of credit with a commercial bank  which is fully cash secured 
we require cash for our general working capital purposes 
we do not anticipate requiring material amounts of cash for capital expenditures over the next months 
to the extent our cash balance is insufficient to finance our working capital needs  we may also make periodic borrowings under our revolving line of credit 
our working capital requirements are highly seasonal in nature  with greater requirements from approximately august through october and february through april of each fiscal year due to the purchases of fashion apparel inventories for the spring summer and fall holiday selling seasons  respectively 
working capital was  and  at june  and  respectively 
cash and cash equivalents plus marketable securities totaled  and  at june  and  respectively 
for purposes of the statements of cash flows  we consider all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents  if they are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and present an insignificant risk of change in value due to changes in interest rates 
net cash provided by used in operating activities totaled   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
the primary components of adjustments to reconcile net loss to cash provided by used in operating activities were changes between fiscal years relating to impairments and write downs  provisions for doubtful accounts and sales returns  accounts receivable  inventories  accounts payable  and accrued commissions and other expenses 
adjustments for impairments and write downs affected net cash provided by used in operating activities by  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the effects on net cash provided by used in operating activities caused by impairments and write downs represent the expense effects of recording impairments and write downs in the respective fiscal years 
because of the seasonal nature of the fashion apparel business  excess inventories left over at the end of each selling season previous seasons inventories are common within the industry 
throughout each fiscal year  we market previous seasons inventories through our ordinary marketing channels 
at or near the end of each fiscal quarter  we identify and revalue obsolete inventories  primarily consisting of previous seasons fashion apparel inventories  to estimated disposition values 
in fiscal  we enacted initiatives directed to significantly reduce the levels of finished goods inventories in order to minimize the adverse financial effects associated with the devaluation of obsolete fashion apparel inventories 
in fiscal  we sold a significant portion of our previous seasons fashion apparel inventories and refined our procedures to better estimate the recoverability our finished goods inventories  and we established new procedures for purchasing fashion apparel inventories designed to minimize the quantities expected to remain at the end of each selling season 
in   of the  inventory write down related to branded apparel inventories on hand at june  generally  branded apparel inventories are not prone to impairment  because we usually order branded apparel in exact quantities to sufficiently satisfy specific customer orders 
in fiscal  we sold all remaining branded apparel inventories on hand at june   without recording a significant gain or loss on the sale 
in fiscal  in accordance with sfas  we impaired  in goodwill which had been recorded upon our purchase of the minority interest in reserve apparel from explorer gear in september at june   we determined that the goodwill was sufficiently impaired per the guidance offered by sfas to warrant impairing the entire balance  because since purchasing the minority interest we have not been able to locate a significant customer for our top flite branded apparel 
the effects on net cash provided by operating activities caused by changes in provisions for doubtful accounts and sales returns primarily represent the net expense effects of the changes in allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns between the respective years 
as of june  our allowances for doubtful accounts were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal the allowances for  and included specific reserves of   and  respectively  with respect to certain customer accounts receivable 
we believe that the trend which indicates a general decrease in the required allowance amount is primarily attributable to the changes in collection methods that we instituted in fiscal the changes in our collection methods help us to shorten the collection process with regard to past due accounts  thereby minimizing potentially uncollectible amounts
