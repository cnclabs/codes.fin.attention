item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this annual report includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act if  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are forward looking statements for purposes of these provisions  including any statements regarding projections of earnings  statements regarding the future results of ecera  revenues  gross margins or other financial items  plans and objectives of management for future operations  future purchases of capital equipment  future expenditures  potential acquisitions  proposed new products or services and their development schedule  industry  technological or market trends  our ability to address the need for application specific logic products  our ability to respond rapidly to customer needs  expanding product sales  future economic conditions or performance  and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
in some cases  forward looking statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as may  will  expects  plans  anticipates  estimates  potential  or continue  or the negative thereof or other comparable terminology 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements contained herein are reasonable  there can be no assurance that such expectations or any of the forward looking statements will prove to be correct  and actual results could differ materially from those projected or assumed in the forward looking statements 
some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially are set forth herein in item a  risk factors  of this report and elsewhere in this report 
all forward looking statements and reasons why results may differ included in this annual report are made as of the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statement or reason why actual results may differ 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of such consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that we consider reasonable given the circumstances 
actual results may vary from our estimates 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical as defined by the sec  in that they are both highly important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make difficult judgments and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain 
we also have other important policies that we discuss in note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from the sale of our products in conformity with the sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  sab no 

accordingly  the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  the company meets these conditions upon shipment because  in most cases  title and risk of loss passes to the customer at that time 
in addition  the company estimates and records provisions for future returns and other charges against revenue at the time of shipment in accordance with sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists sfas no 

for some of our products  notably our fcps that we manufacture in taiwan  we recognize revenue upon delivery for taiwan sales and for foreign sales  days after shipment 
our sales terms for fcp are usually fob shipping point and we use federal express fedex for all of our deliveries 
fedex delivers shipments within one day to taiwanese customers and within days for foreign customers 

table of contents we sell products to both large domestic and international distributors 
we sell our products to domestic distributors at the price listed in our price book for that distributor 
at the time of shipment  we book a sales reserve for the entire amount if the customer has the right to return the product 
in addition  at the time of sale we book a sales reserve for ship from stock and debits ssd s  stock rotations  return material authorizations rma s  authorized price protection programs  and any special programs approved by management 
these sales reserves offset revenues  which produces the net revenues amount we report in our consolidated financial statements 
the market price for our products can be significantly different from the book price at which we sold the product to the distributor 
when the market price  as compared with the book price  of a particular sales opportunity from our distributor to their customer would result in low or negative margins to our distributor  we negotiate a ship from stock and debit with the distributor 
we analyze our ssd history and use the history to develop ssd rates that form the basis of the ssd sales reserve we record each period 
we use historical ssd rates to estimate the ultimate net sales price to the distributor 
our distribution agreements provide for semi annual stock rotation privileges of typically of net sales for the previous six month period 
the contractual stock rotation applies only to shipments at book price 
asian distributors typically buy our product at less than book price and therefore are not entitled to the stock rotation privilege 
in order to provide for routine inventory refreshing  for our benefit as well as theirs  we typically grant asian distributors stock rotation privileges between and even though we are not contractually obligated to do so 
each month we record a sales reserve for the estimated stock rotation privilege earned by our distributors that month 
this reserve is the product of each distributor s net sales for the month times their stock rotation percentage 
from time to time  customers may request to return parts for various reasons including the customers belief that the parts are not performing to specification 
many such return requests are the result of customers incorrectly using the parts  not because the parts are defective 
our management reviews these requests and  if approved  we establish a rma 
we are only obligated to accept returns of defective parts 
for customer convenience  we may approve a particular return request  even though we are not obligated to do so 
each month  we record a sales reserve for the approved rmas that have not yet been returned 
in the past  we have not kept a general warranty reserve because historically valid warranty returns  which are the result of a part not meeting specifications or being non functional  have been immaterial and frequently we can resell parts to other customers for use in other applications 
we monitor and assess rma activity and overall materiality to assess whether a general warranty reserve has become appropriate 
we grant price protection solely at the discretion of our management 
the purpose of price protection is to reduce our distributors cost of inventory as market prices fall  which reduces our ssd rates 
our sales management team prepares price protection proposals for individual products located at individual distributors 
our general management reviews these proposals and if a particular price protection arrangement is approved  we estimate the dollar impact based on the book price reduction per unit for the products approved and the number of units of those products in that distributor s inventory 
we record a sales reserve in that period for the estimated amount in accordance with issue of emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
at the discretion of our management  we may offer rebates on specific products sold to specific end customers 
the purpose of the rebates is to allow for pricing adjustments for large programs without affecting the pricing we charge our distributor customers 
we record the customer s rebate at the time of shipment 
customers are typically granted payment terms of between and days and they generally pay within those terms 
we grant relatively few customers any sales terms that include cash discounts 
we invoice our distributors for shipments at our listed book price 
when our distributors pay those invoices  they may claim debits for ssds  stock rotations  cash discounts  rmas and price protection when appropriate 
once claimed  we agree these debits to our management s prior approvals and reduce the reserve we previously established for that customer 
the revenue we record for sales to our distributors is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
we base our estimates on 
table of contents historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current trends and other related factors 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results depend on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
cash and cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and in banks and all highly liquid debt investments with a time to maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase 
short and long term investments 
our policy is to invest excess funds in instruments with investment grade credit ratings 
we classify our investments as available for sale or trading in conformity with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

further  we classify our trading securities as current assets and our available for sale securities as either current or non current based on the specific attributes of each security 
we recognize unrealized losses in our trading securities in current earnings  unrealized gains and losses in our available for sale securities as an increase or reduction in shareholders equity and we do not recognize unrealized losses in our held to maturity securities 
we report our trading and available for sale securities at their fair values and held to maturity securities at their amortized cost 
we evaluate our available for sale securities for impairment quarterly 
sfas no 
defines impairment as a loss in value that is other than temporary 
we recognize impairment losses in our consolidated income statement in the period in which we discover the impairment 
we have also made other investments including loans  bridge loans convertible to equity or asset purchases as well as direct equity investments 
we make these loans and investments with strategic intentions and  historically  are in privately held technology companies  which by their nature are high risk 
these investments are included in other assets in the balance sheet and we carry them at the lower of cost  or market if the investment has experienced an other than temporary decline in value 
we monitor these investments quarterly and make appropriate reductions in carrying value if we deem a decline in value is other than temporary 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we evaluate our allowance for doubtful accounts using a combination of factors 
we record a specific allowance in cases where we become aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to pay fully their financial obligation to us 
for all other customers  we recognize an allowance based on the length of time the receivable balances are past due  based on the current economic environment and our historical experience 
inventories 
for our siliconconnect  siliconswitch  siliconinterface  siliconclock and certain fcp families of products we record inventories at the lower of standard cost which generally approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
we adjust the carrying value of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory based on inventory age  shipment history and our forecast of demand over a specific future period 
the semiconductor markets that we serve are volatile and actual results may vary from our forecast or other assumptions  potentially affecting our assessment of excess and obsolete inventory resulting in material effects on our gross margin 
we record the inventories of the remainder of our fcp products at the lower of weighted average cost or market value 
weighted average cost is comprised of average manufacturing costs weighted by the volume produced in each production run 
we define market value as the net realizable value for our finished goods and replacement cost for raw materials and work in process 
we consider raw material inventory slow moving and we write it down to zero if it has not moved in days 
for assembled devices  we disaggregate the inventory by part number 
we compare the quantities on hand in each part number category to the quantity we shipped in the previous twelve months  the quantity in backlog and to the quantity we expect to ship in the next twelve months 
we write down to zero the value of each quantity on hand that is in excess of the lesser of the three comparisons 
we believe our method of evaluating our inventory fairly represents market conditions 
we consider the material written off to be available for sale 
we do not revalue the written off inventory should market conditions change or if a market develops for the obsolete inventory 
in the past  we have sold obsolete inventory that we have previously written off as worthless 
refer to the gross profit discussion in this item of our annual report on form k for further discussion of sales of our obsolete inventory 

table of contents property  plant and equipment 
we record our property  plant and equipment at cost and depreciate the cost over the estimated useful lives of each asset classification  ranging between and years 
cost includes purchase cost  applicable taxes  freight  installation costs and interest incurred in the acquisition of any asset that requires a period of time to make it ready for use 
in addition  we capitalize the cost of major replacements  improvements and betterments  while we expense normal maintenance and repair 
investments in unconsolidated affiliates 
the company holds ownership interests in various investees 
our ownership in these affiliates varies from to approximately  which we classify as investment in unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated balance sheets 
the company accounts for long term investments in companies in which it has an ownership share larger than and in which it has significant influence over the activities of the investee using the equity method 
we recognize our proportionate share of each investee s income or loss in the period in which the investee reports the income or loss 
we eliminate all intercompany transactions in accounting for our equity method investments 
impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 which we adopted in fiscal  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we determined that no impairment of our indefinite lived intangible assets existed in fiscal we also test other definite lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we determined that no impairment of these other definite lived intangible assets existed in fiscal income taxes 
we account for income taxes using sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires an asset and liability approach to recording deferred taxes 
our deferred income tax assets represent temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities that will result in deductible amounts in future years  including net operating loss carry forwards 
based on estimates  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  changes in us or international tax laws and other factors 
if  in the future  we experiences losses for a sustained period of time  we may not be able to conclude that it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize our deferred tax assets 
if this occurs  we may be required to increase the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense 
overview we incorporated pericom semiconductor corporation in june in the state of california 
we completed our first profitable fiscal year on june  we design  manufacture and market high performance digital  analog and mixed signal integrated circuits and fcps used for the transfer  routing and timing of digital and analog signals within and between computer  networking  data communications and telecommunications systems 
our first volume sales occurred in fiscal and consisted exclusively of volt bit interface logic circuits 
we have introduced new products to the market every year since we produced our first shipments 
in recent years  we have expanded our product offering by introducing the following products  among others in fiscal  our product solution to support the emerging high performance pci express serial link protocol for computer and communication applications  pci express products to include pci e signal switches  clock generators  and re driver and re timer products  several analog switch and voltage translation products in very small form factor packages to support cell phone and other portable consumer products  the addition of differential video switches operating at greater than ghz to support hdmi dvi signal switching in digital tv and notebook applications which expanded our high performance video switch solution  the introduction of four low voltage  high frequency cmos lvpecl crystal oscillator product families targeting storage and communication applications  
table of contents in fiscal  the first three products of our new pci express bridge and packet switch families for general customer sampling  including one port pci express packet switch and two pci express to pci and pci x bridge products  samples of five new spread spectrum clock generators and vcxo s targeting lcd projectors  lcd televisions  dlp projectors and set top box applications  several new fcps that incorporate both a crystal resonator and a driver ic into an ultra miniature package designed for high density and portable electronic applications by using the synergy of the acquisition of ecera and azer and the existing saronix product development pipeline  and in fiscal  the production availability of gen pci express signal switches and a high performance  zero delay gen clock buffer family  the first in the industry  enabling the design of ultra high speed gbps gen pci express serial connectivity systems  the pcie to pci x bridge for target applications including server  hba  storage  nic cards  video and gaming  networking and telecommunications  one clock synthesizer  two lvpecl differential clocks  three spread spectrum clock generators  three clock buffers  five low phase noise vcxo s  eight new hdmi  four analog video and two high speed usb switches to penetrate target applications including gigabit ethernet networking switch  digital tv  set top box  cell phone  mp mp player and pda 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we expect selling prices for our products to decline over the life of each product 
our ability to increase net revenues is highly dependent upon our ability to increase unit sales volumes of existing products and to introduce and sell new products in quantities sufficient to compensate for the anticipated declines in selling prices of existing products 
in order to have sufficient supply for increased unit sales  we seek to increase the wafer fabrication capacity allocations from our existing foundries  qualify new foundries  increase the number of die per wafer through die size reductions and improve the yields of good die through the implementation of advanced process technologies  but there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these efforts 
magnachip  formerly known as hynix  manufactured approximately  and of the wafers for our semiconductor products in fiscal years  and  respectively 
in addition  chartered manufactured approximately  and of the wafers for our semiconductor products in fiscal years  and  respectively 
declining selling prices will adversely affect gross margins unless we are able to offset such declines with the sale of new  higher margin products or achieve commensurate reductions in unit costs 
we seek to improve our overall gross margin through the development and introduction of selected new products that we believe will ultimately achieve higher gross margins 
a higher gross margin for a new product is typically not achieved until some period after the initial introduction of the product after start up expenses for that product have been incurred and once volume production begins 
in general  costs are higher at the introduction of a new product due to the use of a more generalized design schematic  lower economy of scale in the assembly phase and lower die yield 
our ability to reduce unit cost depends on our ability to shrink the die sizes of our products  improve yields  obtain favorable subcontractor pricing and make in house manufacturing operations more productive and efficient 
there can be no assurance that these efforts  even if successful  will be sufficient to offset declining selling prices

table of contents comparison of fiscal  and net revenues the following table sets forth our revenues and the customer concentrations with respect to such revenues for the periods indicated fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands june  july  change july  july  change net revenues percentage of net revenues accounted for by top direct customers number of direct customers that each account for more than of net revenues 
percentage of net revenues accounted for by top end customers number of end customers that each account for more than of net revenues direct customers purchase products directly from the company 
these customers include distributors and contract manufacturers that in turn sell to many end customers as well as oems that also purchase directly from the company 
end customers are oems whose products include the company s products 
end customers may purchase directly from the company or from distributors or contract manufacturers 
for end customer sales data  we rely on the end customer data provided by our direct distribution and contract manufacturing customers 
on september   we purchased a share of ecera 
beginning with the quarter ended october   our revenues included revenues from ecera 
for the fiscal years ended june  and july   we recorded ecera revenue totaling million and million  respectively 
during fiscal  our industry began to recover from depressed business conditions that had begun in our order backlog began to grow in early and the orders that book and ship in the same quarter turns orders declined as a percentage of our total orders 
in late fiscal order rates again slowed in response to an imbalance of inventory as compared with end demand  and the percentage of turns orders again increased 
in fiscal  ic order rates improved  marked by a decline in the percentage of our sales represented by turns orders  and this trend continued in  but we remain heavily reliant on turns orders 
our reliance on turns orders  the uncertain strength of our end markets and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy make it difficult to predict near term demand 

table of contents our order backlog stood at million as of june  and million as of july  we expect to fulfill our backlogged orders as of june  within the first quarter of fiscal net revenues consist of product sales  which we generally recognize upon shipment  less an estimate for returns and allowances 
net revenue increased in fiscal versus primarily due to inclusion of fifty two weeks of ecera s financial results in compared with only forty three weeks of ecera s results being included in fiscal  which added million  organic growth in ecera s business  which contributed million  and an increase in the number of units shipped in our core legacy product lines  which increased by million 
for the years ended june  and july   net revenue included sales reserves for price protection and rebates in the amount of  and  respectively 
net revenues increased in fiscal versus due to revenue contributed from the ecera acquisition that we completed in fiscal of million and an improvement in market conditions for our legacy products  which added million 
however  market conditions could again become more difficult as other companies compete more aggressively for business 
pricing for our higher margin analog switch  clock and connect products  many of which are proprietary  is more stable and new product introductions and cost reductions generally offset price declines 
for the years ended july  and july   net revenue included sales reserves for price protection and rebates in the amount of  and  respectively 
the following table sets forth net revenues by country as a percentage of total net revenues for the fiscal years ended june   july  and july  fiscal year ended june  july  july  china including hong kong taiwan united states singapore other less than each total for the fiscal years ended june  and july   as compared with fiscal year  the percentage of our net revenues derived from sales to china  taiwan and the united states changed  principally because of ecera s operations 
ecera derives its revenue primarily from customers in taiwan and china 
in addition  we are shipping an increasing number of products to asia where an increasing volume of contract manufacturing work occurs 
we expect our future sales to continue to grow  as a percentage of net revenues  in taiwan and china in future periods 
as the migration of assembly operations to asia continues  we expect our net revenues from sales in north america to decline  as they have during fiscal gross profit fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands june  july  change july  july  change net revenues gross profit gross profit percentage with respect to the increase in gross profit in fiscal as compared to fiscal of million  we attribute the increase to the inclusion of fifty two weeks of ecera s operations in fiscal versus forty three weeks included in fiscal which contributed million  
table of contents ecera s organic sales growth  as mentioned above  which generated million increased gross profit  improved margins in ecera s sales which added million in gross profit  and organic sales growth in our sales of core legacy products  which added million to gross profit  which was partially offset by a small decline in our gross profit percentage that reduced gross profit by  and an inventory return reserve in fiscal of  relating to a distributor termination 
the increase in gross profit in fiscal versus fiscal was primarily due to the inclusion of ecera s sales beginning september   which contributed million  organic growth in our core legacy products families  which provided additional gross margin of million  and a increase in our gross margin percentage resulting from an improved product mix  which added  to gross profit 
during fiscal years  and  gross profits and gross margins benefited from the sale of inventory  previously valued at   and  respectively  that we had previously identified as excess and written off 
future gross profit and gross margin are highly dependent on the level and product mix included in net revenues 
this includes the mix of sales between lower margin fcp products and our higher margin integrated circuit products 
although we have been successful at favorably improving our integrated circuit product mix and penetrating new end markets  there can be no assurance that this will continue 
accordingly  we are not able to predict future gross profit levels or gross margins with certainty 
research and development fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands june  july  change july  july  change net revenues research and development r d as a percentage of net revenues research and development r d expenses consist primarily of costs related to personnel and overhead  non recurring engineering charges and other costs associated with the design  prototyping and testing of new product concepts  manufacturing process support and customer applications support 
the increase of  in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily the result of additional stock based compensation expense of  and increased personnel expenses of approximately  the decrease in fiscal from fiscal was primarily because we incurred unusually significant r d wafer fabrication and assembly charges in fiscal when chartered closed one of its fabrication facilities 
we redesigned and re qualified a significant number of our products in fiscal  recognizing incremental costs of million that we did not incur in fiscal  in order to migrate our production to another facility 
we incurred  related to our adoption of sfas r in fiscal   in expenses to continue the ramp up of research and development at our pericom taiwan ltd 
subsidiary and  in ecera research and development costs from september  through july   which partially offset the decrease in wafer fabrication and assembly charges 
we believe that continued investment in research and development to develop new products and improve manufacturing processes is critical to our success and  consequently  we expect to increase research and development expenses in future periods over the long term 

table of contents selling  general and administrative fiscal year ended fiscal year ended in thousands june  july  change july  july  change net revenues selling  general and administrative sg a percentage of net revenues selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist primarily of personnel and related overhead costs for sales  marketing  finance  administration  human resources and general management 
the expense increase of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is partially due to the inclusion of a full fifty two weeks of ecera sg a expenses in the current year as compared to only forty three weeks in the comparable period in the prior year  which added  to our costs 
the increase was also the result of increases of million in personnel expense  million of audit  tax and consulting fees  primarily related to sarbanes oxley compliance  and  in stock based compensation expense 
the expense increase of million in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is due to the inclusion of ecera sg a expense resulting from the acquisition and subsequent consolidation of ecera financial results from september  through july   which added million  as well as stock based compensation expense of  which we incurred in fiscal upon our adoption of sfas r and a gain on the sale of a building in fiscal that was included in sg a in fiscal of  we partially offset the above increases by reducing distributor representative commissions by  through changes in our focus product commission structure and decreasing personnel expenses by  through implementation of our fiscal restructuring initiative  described below 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in future periods as we add to our support and administrative staff  particularly in sales and marketing  and as we face increasing commission expense to the extent we achieve higher sales levels 
although we recognized the majority of costs associated with compliance with sarbanes oxley section in fiscal  we believe continuing compliance will be a significant expense 
we intend to continue to focus on controlling selling  general and administrative expenses 
restructuring charge in the year ended july   restructuring charges totaled  and were related to a final settlement of an outstanding claim from the february reduction in force described below 
in the year ended july   we recorded restructuring charges of  in connection with a reduction of employee positions 
the eliminated positions were mostly production related  but we also reduced positions in sales and administration as well 
the intended effect of the restructuring was to continue our outsourcing program  realign our sales force to reflect geographic sales changes  our revised selling strategy and to reduce costs 
if business conditions deteriorate or the rate of improvement does not meet our expectations  we may implement further cost cutting actions

a reconciliation of our tax rates for fiscal years   and is detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in this report on form k 
in october  we purchased saronix  llc 
included in the purchase were certain deferred tax assets 
in the initial evaluation of these assets  we concluded the assets could not be utilized so we assigned no value to them 
during fiscal  we determined that certain deferred tax assets acquired in the saronix transaction could be utilized 
we calculated the value of the assets by determining the present value of certain tax savings we could realize in the future 
the amount we assigned to the deferred tax assets was million 
we reduced the value of certain previously reported intangible assets by an equal and offsetting amount 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements of this report on form k for further discussion 

table of contents as stated earlier in this annual report on form k  we purchased ecera on september  subsequent to the purchase date  the company determined that certain of ecera s deferred tax assets that had been considered worthless could be utilized 
this resulted in a reduction of purchased goodwill of  and intangible assets of million to offset the increased value of the deferred tax assets

pericom and certain pericom shareholders formed pti in to develop and market semiconductors in china and certain other asian countries 
in addition  we have included in this classification other income losses realized from other investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
we adopted emerging issues task force issue no 
 whether an investor should apply the equity method of accounting to investments other than common stock eitf in the quarter ended december  the adoption did not cause us to cease recognizing our allocated portion of the net income or losses of pti 
our allocated portion of pti s results increased to a profit of  and million in fiscal years and  respectively  from a profit of  in fiscal the decrease of million in equity in net income of investees in fiscal  as compared to fiscal is primarily due to the lower percentage at which we recouped pti s net income during in  the company recouped pti s net income at as compared to in we will continue to use the allocation percentage until we have recouped all the losses we recognized in prior years in accordance with eitf once we have accomplished that  we will revert to recognizing our share of pti s net income at our percentage ownership level  which is currently 
we primarily attribute the increase in equity in net income of investees in fiscal when compared to fiscal to an improvement in the markets pti serves 
partially offsetting this improvement  we realized net losses from other investments of approximately  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources as of june   our principal sources of liquidity included cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments of approximately million  as compared with million as of july  and million as of july  in fiscal  we made no acquisitions of other companies  instead  we continued to assimilate acquisitions made in fiscal in fiscal  we purchased of ecera comtek corporation for million in cash 
subsequent to our purchase of ecera  we exercised an option to acquire the remaining of azer  which we did not own  for million in cash and million in assumed debt 
as of june   we owned assets classified as cash and cash equivalents of million as compared to million as of july  and million as of july  the maturities of our short term investments are staggered throughout the year to ensure we meet our cash requirements 
because we are primarily a fabless semiconductor manufacturer  we have lower capital equipment requirements than other semiconductor manufacturers that own fabrication foundries fabs 
during the fiscal year  we purchased million of property and equipment as compared to million and million in fiscal 
table of contents and  respectively 
the decrease in spending on property and equipment in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to reduced purchases by ecera offset in part by an increase in spending by other pericom entities 
the significant increase in spending on property and equipment in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to additional investment in ecera and investments to increase production capacity within our manufacturing operations we generated approximately million of interest and other income during the fiscal year ended june  compared to million and million in the fiscal years ended july  and july   respectively 
the increase in interest and other income in fiscal as compared with fiscal was primarily attributable to a million increase in interest income and to a million gain from the sale of of an investment in a privately held semiconductor company 
in the longer term  we may generate less interest income if our total invested balance decreases and the decrease is not offset by rising interest rates or increased cash generated from operations or other sources 
in fiscal  our net cash provided by operating activities of approximately million was a result of net income of million  favorable changes in assets and liabilities of million and non cash adjustments to net income of million

item a 
quantitative qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosure at june   the company s investment portfolio consisted primarily of fixed income securities  excluding those classified as cash equivalents  of million see note of notes to financial statements 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
we could realize a loss on these securities if we were forced to sell them in a period when interest rates are higher than current rates 
we do not expect such a scenario to occur 
for example  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of june   the decline in the fair value of the portfolio would be approximately million 
on the other hand  if interest rates were to decline the effect on our portfolio would be the opposite 
the company transacts business in various non us currencies  primarily the new taiwan dollar and the japanese yen 
the company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable from sales in these foreign currencies and the net monetary assets and liabilities of the related foreign subsidiary 
a hypothetical unfavorable change in the foreign currency exchange rate would reduce cash by approximately million
