introduction landstar system  inc and its subsidiary  landstar system holdings  inc together  referred to herein as landstar or the company  provide transportation services to a variety of market niches throughout the united states and to a lesser extent in canada  and between the united states and canada  mexico and other countries through its operating subsidiaries 
landstar s business strategy is to be a non asset based provider of transportation capacity and logistics services delivering safe  specialized transportation services globally  utilizing a network of independent commission sales agents  third party capacity providers and employees 
landstar focuses on providing transportation services which emphasize safety  customer service and information coordination among its independent commission sales agents  customers and capacity providers 
the company markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents and exclusively utilizes third party capacity providers to transport customers freight 
the nature of the company s business is such that a significant portion of its operating costs varies directly with revenue 
the company has three reportable business segments 
these are the carrier  global logistics and insurance segments 
the carrier segment consists of landstar ranger  inc  landstar inway  inc  landstar ligon  inc  landstar gemini  inc 
and landstar carrier services  inc the carrier segment primarily provides transportation services to the truckload market for a wide range of general commodities over irregular or non repetitive routes utilizing dry and specialty vans and unsided trailers  including flatbed  drop deck and specialty 
it also provides short to long haul movement of containers by truck  dedicated power only truck capacity and truck brokerage 
the carrier segment markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents and utilizes independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company under exclusive lease arrangements the business capacity owner independent contractors or bco independent contractors and other third party truck capacity providers under non exclusive contractual arrangements truck brokerage carriers 
the global logistics segment is comprised of landstar global logistics  inc and its subsidiaries  landstar logistics  inc 
and landstar express america  inc transportation and logistics services provided by the global logistics segment include the arrangement of multimodal ground  air  ocean and rail moves  contract logistics  truck brokerage  emergency and expedited ground  air and ocean freight  bus brokerage and warehousing 
the global logistics segment markets its services primarily through independent commission sales agents and utilizes capacity provided by bco independent contractors and other third party capacity providers  including truck brokerage carriers  railroads  air and ocean cargo carriers  bus providers and warehouse owners 
beginning in august  the global logistics segment began the rollout of warehousing services with independent contractors who provide warehouse capacity to the company under non exclusive contractual arrangements warehouse capacity owners or wco independent contractors 
as of december   landstar global logistics  inc has executed contracts with warehouse capacity owners 
the insurance segment is comprised of signature insurance company signature  a wholly owned offshore insurance subsidiary  and risk management claim services  inc the insurance segment provides risk and claims management services to landstar s operating subsidiaries 
in addition  it reinsures certain risks of 
table of contents the company s bco independent contractors and provides certain property and casualty insurance directly to landstar s operating subsidiaries 
during the fiscal year ended december   the carrier segment contributed of landstar s consolidated revenue  the global logistics segment contributed of landstar s consolidated revenue and the insurance segment contributed of landstar s consolidated revenue 
changes in financial condition and results of operations management believes the company s success principally depends on its ability to generate freight through its network of independent commission sales agents and to efficiently deliver that freight utilizing third party capacity providers 
management believes the most significant factors to the company s success include increasing revenue  sourcing capacity and controlling costs 
while customer demand  which is subject to overall economic conditions  ultimately drives increases or decreases in revenue  the company primarily relies on its independent commission sales agents to establish customer relationships and generate revenue opportunities 
management s primary focus with respect to revenue growth is on revenue generated by independent commission sales agents who on an annual basis generate million or more of landstar revenue million dollar agents 
management believes future revenue growth is primarily dependent on its ability to increase both the revenue generated by million dollar agents and the number of million dollar agents through a combination of recruiting new agents and increasing the revenue opportunities generated by existing independent commission sales agents 
the following table shows the number of million dollar agents  the average revenue generated by these agents  the percent of consolidated revenue generated by these agents during the past three fiscal years and the number of agent locations at each fiscal year end fiscal year number of million dollar agents average revenue generated per million dollar agent percent of consolidated revenue generated by million dollar agents number of independent commission sales agent locations at year end 
table of contents management monitors business activity by tracking the number of loads volume and revenue per load generated by the carrier and global logistics segments 
in addition  management tracks revenue per revenue mile  average length of haul and total revenue miles at the carrier segment 
revenue per revenue mile and revenue per load collectively  price as well as the number of loads  can be influenced by many factors which do not necessarily indicate a change in price or volume 
those factors include the average length of haul  freight type  special handling and equipment requirements and delivery time requirements 
the following table summarizes this data by reportable segment for the past three fiscal years fiscal year carrier segment external revenue generated through in thousands bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers revenue per revenue mile revenue per load average length of haul miles number of loads global logistics segment external revenue generated through in thousands bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers rail  air  ocean and bus carriers revenue per load number of loads includes revenue from freight hauled by carrier segment bco independent contractors for global logistics customers 
included in the and fiscal year was  and  respectively  of revenue attributable to buses provided under a contract between landstar express america  inc and the united states department of transportation federal aviation administration the faa 
number of loads and revenue per load for the  and fiscal years exclude the effect of   and  respectively  of revenue derived from transportation services provided primarily under a contract with the faa as discussed further in the paragraphs that follow 
see the section use of non gaap financial measures on page 
table of contents also critical to the company s success is its ability to secure capacity  particularly truck capacity  at rates that allow the company to profitably transport customers freight 
the following table summarizes available truck capacity providers as of the end of the three most recent fiscal years dec 
 dec 
 dec 
 bco independent contractors truck brokerage carriers approved and active other approved total available truck capacity providers number of trucks provided by bco independent contractors active refers to truck brokerage carriers who moved at least one load in the days immediately preceding the fiscal year end 
historically  the company s carrier segment has primarily relied on capacity provided by bco independent contractors 
pursuant to a continuing plan to augment its available capacity and increase its revenue  the company has been increasing the carrier segment s use of capacity provided by truck brokerage carriers 
the percent of consolidated revenue generated through all truck brokerage carriers was during  during and during the company incurs costs that are directly related to the transportation of freight that include purchased transportation and commissions to agents 
the company incurs indirect costs associated with the transportation of freight that include other operating costs and insurance and claims 
in addition  the company incurs selling  general and administrative costs essential to administering its business operations 
management continually monitors all components of the costs incurred by the company and establishes annual cost budgets which  in general  are used to benchmark costs incurred on a monthly basis 
purchased transportation represents the amount a bco independent contractor or other third party capacity provider is paid to haul freight 
the amount of purchased transportation paid to a bco independent contractor is primarily based on a contractually agreed upon percentage of revenue generated by the haul 
purchased transportation for the brokerage services operations of the carrier segment is based on a negotiated rate for each load hauled 
purchased transportation for the brokerage services operations of the global logistics segment is based on either a negotiated rate for each load hauled or a contractually agreed upon rate 
purchased transportation for the rail intermodal  air and ocean freight operations of the global logistics segment is based on a contractually agreed upon fixed rate 
purchased transportation for bus services is based upon a negotiated rate per mile or per day 
purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue for truck brokerage services  rail intermodal and bus operations is normally higher than that of landstar s other transportation operations 
purchased transportation is the largest component of costs and expenses and  on a consolidated basis  increases or decreases in proportion to the revenue generated through bco independent contractors  other third party capacity providers and revenue from the insurance segment 
commissions to agents are based on contractually agreed upon percentages of revenue or gross profit  defined as revenue less the cost of purchased transportation  at the carrier segment and of gross profit at the global logistics segment 
commissions to agents as a percentage of consolidated revenue will vary directly with fluctuations in the percentage of consolidated revenue generated by the carrier segment  the global logistics segment and the insurance segment and with changes in gross profit at the global logistics segment and the truck brokerage operations of the carrier segment 
trailing equipment rent  maintenance costs for trailing equipment  bco independent contractor recruiting costs and bad debts from bco independent contractors and independent commission sales agents are the largest components of other operating costs 

table of contents potential liability associated with accidents in the trucking industry is severe and occurrences are unpredictable 
landstar s retained liability for individual commercial trucking claims varies depending on when such claims are incurred 
for commercial trucking claims incurred prior to june  and subsequent to march   landstar retains liability up to  per occurrence 
for commercial trucking claims incurred from june  through march   landstar retains liability up to  per occurrence 
the company also retains liability for each general liability claim up to   for each workers compensation claim and  for each cargo claim 
the company s exposure to liability associated with accidents incurred by other third party capacity providers who haul freight on behalf of the company is reduced by various factors including the extent to which they maintain their own insurance coverage 
a material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents  cargo or workers compensation claims or the unfavorable development of existing claims could be expected to materially adversely affect landstar s results of operations 
employee compensation and benefits account for over half of the company s selling  general and administrative costs 
depreciation and amortization primarily relate to depreciation of trailing equipment and management information services equipment

legal matters on november   the owner operator independent drivers association  inc ooida and certain bco independent contractors as defined below collectively with ooida  the plaintiffs filed a putative class action complaint on behalf of independent contractors who provide truck capacity to the company and its subsidiaries under exclusive lease arrangements bco independent contractors in the united states district court for the middle district of florida the court in jacksonville  florida  against the company and certain of its subsidiaries  which was amended on april  the amended complaint 
the 
table of contents amended complaint alleges that certain aspects of the company s motor carrier leases and related practices with its bco independent contractors violate certain federal leasing regulations and seeks injunctive relief  an unspecified amount of damages and attorney s fees 
on august   the court granted a motion by the plaintiffs to certify the case as a class action 
on october   the court issued a summary judgment ruling which found  among other things  that the lease agreements of the defendants as defined below literally complied with the requirements of section d of the applicable federal leasing regulations in regards to provisions relating to reductions to revenue derived from freight upon which bco independent contractors compensation is calculated  charge back amounts which include fees and profits to the motor carrier are not unlawful under section h and the defendants had violated h of the regulations by failing to provide access to documents to determine the validity of certain charges 
on january   the court ruled that the monetary remedy available to the plaintiffs would be limited to damages sustained as a result of the violation and rejected plaintiffs request for equitable relief in the form of restitution or disgorgement 
on january   the court ordered the decertification of the class of bco independent contractors for purposes of determining remedies 
immediately thereafter  the trial commenced for purposes of determining what remedies  if any  would be awarded to the remaining named bco independent contractor plaintiffs against the following subsidiaries of the company landstar inway  inc  landstar ligon  inc 
and landstar ranger  inc the defendants 
on january   in response to a motion filed by the defendants following the presentation by the plaintiffs of their case in chief  the court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants and stated that the plaintiffs had failed to present evidence that any of the plaintiffs had sustained damages as a result of any violation of the applicable federal leasing regulations 
on that date  the court also ruled that access to documents describing a third party vendor s charges to determine the validity of charge back amounts under h was not required under defendants current lease with respect to programs where the lease contains a price to a bco independent contractor that is not calculated on the basis of a third party vendor s charge to the defendants 
plaintiffs request for injunctive relief remains pending 
upon entry by the court of a written final judgment  the plaintiffs will have the right to appeal the court s rulings 
the company is involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business 
based on knowledge of the facts and  in certain cases  opinions of outside counsel  management believes that adequate provisions have been made for probable losses with respect to the resolution of all such other claims and pending litigation and that the ultimate outcome  after provisions thereof  will not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the company  but could have a material effect on the results of operations in a given quarter or year 
critical accounting policies and estimates the allowance for doubtful accounts for both trade and other receivables represents management s estimate of the amount of outstanding receivables that will not be collected 
historically  management s estimates for uncollectible receivables have been materially correct 
although management believes the amount of the allowance for both trade and other receivables at december  is appropriate  a prolonged period of low or no economic growth may adversely affect the collection of these receivables 
conversely  a more robust economic environment may result in the realization of some portion of the estimated uncollectible receivables 
landstar provides for the estimated costs of self insured claims primarily on an actuarial basis 
the amount recorded for the estimated liability for claims incurred is based upon the facts and circumstances known on the balance sheet date 
the ultimate resolution of these claims may be for an amount greater or less than the amount estimated by management 
historically  the company has experienced both favorable and unfavorable development of prior year claims estimates 
the company continually revises its existing claim estimates as new or revised information becomes available on the status of each claim 
during fiscal years and  insurance and claims costs included  and  respectively  of favorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates 
during fiscal year  insurance and claims costs included 
table of contents  of unfavorable adjustments to prior years claims estimates 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate outcome of settling all outstanding claims will be more or less than the estimated claims reserve at december  the company utilizes certain income tax planning strategies to reduce its overall cost of income taxes 
upon audit  it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
the company has provided for its estimated exposure attributable to income tax planning strategies 
management believes that the provision for liabilities resulting from the implementation of income tax planning strategies is appropriate 
to date  the company has not experienced an examination by governmental revenue authorities that would lead management to believe that the company s past provisions for exposures related to income tax planning strategies are not appropriate 
significant variances from management s estimates for the amount of uncollectible receivables  the ultimate resolution of claims or the provision for liabilities for income tax planning strategies can be expected to positively or negatively affect landstar s earnings in a given quarter or year 
however  management believes that the ultimate resolution of these items  given a range of reasonably likely outcomes  will not significantly affect the long term financial condition of landstar or its ability to fund its continuing operations 
effects of inflation management does not believe inflation has had a material impact on the results of operations or financial condition of landstar in the past five years 
however  inflation higher than that experienced in the past five years might have an adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
seasonality landstar s operations are subject to seasonal trends common to the trucking industry 
results of operations for the quarter ending in march are typically lower than the quarters ending june  september and december
