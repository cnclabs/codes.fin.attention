table of contents overview the company is the nation s largest domestic inland tank barge operator with a fleet of active tank barges and towing vessels 
the company uses the united states inland waterway system to transport bulk liquids including petrochemicals  black oil products  refined petroleum products and agricultural chemicals 
the company also owns and operates four ocean going barge and tug units transporting dry bulk commodities in united states coastwise trade 
through its diesel engine services segment  the company provides after market services for medium speed and high speed diesel engines used in marine  power generation and railroad applications 
for  the company reported the highest revenue  net earnings and earnings per share in its history for the third straight year 
the company reported net earnings of  or per share  on revenues of  a significant improvement over the record setting net earnings of  or per share  on revenues of  and net earnings of  or 
per share  on revenues of  the record setting performance reflected continued strong petrochemical  black oil products and refined petroleum products demand in its marine transportation segment  coupled with higher term contract rate renewals and higher spot market pricing 
the united states petrochemical and refining industries continued to operate their plants and refineries at high utilization rates 
the record results also reflected a strong performance by the diesel engine services segment  positively impacted by continued strong service activity and direct parts sales in the majority of its markets  higher service rates and parts pricing  and accretive earnings from the global and mes acquisitions 
marine transportation during  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by its marine transportation segment 
the segment s customers include many of the major petrochemical and refining companies in the united states 
products transported include raw materials for many of the end products used widely by businesses and consumers every day plastics  fiber  paints  detergents  oil additives and paper  among others

during  the demand for the transportation of petrochemical products remained strong  with term contract customers continuing to operate their plants and facilities at high utilization rates  resulting in high tank barge utilization 
the black oil products market contributed of marine transportation revenue 
this market also remained strong throughout as refineries operated at close to full capacity  generating high demand for the transportation of heavier residual oil by products by barge 

table of contents the refined petroleum products market contributed of marine transportation revenue and the agricultural chemical market contributed of marine transportation revenue 
the marine transportation revenue and operating income were negatively impacted by a shortage of vessel personnel as well as a shortage of gulf coast towboats 
the vessel personnel shortage resulted in higher vessel personnel wages and higher training costs as a result of increased training and recruiting of vessel personnel at all levels 
the shortage of gulf coast towboats resulted in the payment of higher charter boat rates to attract and retain towboats 
while the average cost per gallon of diesel fuel consumed for was  higher than the for  through fuel cost recovery clauses in marine transportation long term contracts  the estimated impact of the increased cost of diesel fuel was neutral 
the company adjusts term contract rates for fuel on either a monthly or quarterly basis  depending on the specific contract 
the first quarter earnings were positively impacted and the second quarter earnings were negatively impacted by an estimated 
to 
per share from fuel cost recovery under certain long term contracts 
fuel cost for the third and fourth quarters had a neutral impact 
during  approximately of the marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot market revenues 
rates under term contracts renewed during increased in the to average range  with some contracts increasing by a higher percentage and some by a lower percentage 
effective january   annual escalators for labor and the producer price index on a number of multi year contracts resulted in rate increases on those contracts by to 
spot market rates for for most marine transportation markets increased to compared with spot market rates include the cost of fuel 
navigational delay days for were  days  down compared with a record setting  days for the reduction was primarily the result of favorable weather conditions and water levels during compared with high water conditions on the illinois  ohio and mississippi rivers in the first quarter  and delays caused by hurricanes katrina and rita in the third quarter 
the marine transportation operating margin for improved to compared with for continued strong demand  contract and spot market rate increases  the january  escalators on long term contracts and favorable weather conditions for compared with  partially offset by vessel personnel wage increases and towboat shortages  contributed to the higher operating margin 
the company s continued emphasis on safety  with and being record setting safety performance years  also contributed to the improved operating margin 
diesel engine services during  approximately of the company s revenue was generated by its diesel engine services segment  of which was generated through service and from direct parts sales 
the results of the diesel engine services segment are largely influenced by the economic cycles of the industries it serves

table of contents the diesel engine services segment s operating margin for improved to compared with for  reflecting the accretive acquisitions of global and mes  stronger markets  higher service activities  which generally earn a higher operating margin than direct parts sales  increased pricing for service and parts  and higher labor utilization 
cash flow and capital expenditures the company continued to generate strong operating cash flow during  with net cash provided from operations of  a increase compared with  for in addition  the company generated cash from the disposition of assets of  and  from the exercise of stock options during the cash  and borrowings under the revolving credit facility  were used for capital expenditures of  including  for new tank barge and towboat construction and  primarily for upgrading the existing marine transportation fleet  and  for the acquisition of the remaining interest in dixie fuels  the acquisitions of global  mes and gulf coast fire safety  and the purchase of towboats  including nine from capital towing 
the company s debt to capitalization ratio increased to at december  from at december   primarily due to borrowings under the company s revolving credit facility to finance the acquisitions noted above 
during and early  the company entered into contracts for the construction of twenty three  barrel tank barges at a cost of approximately  and two  barrel specialty tank barges at a cost of approximately  fifteen of the  barrel barges represent additional capacity and eight are replacement barges for older barges removed from service 
the two  barrel barges are additional capacity 
the company took delivery of of the twenty three  barrel barges during  with the remaining four scheduled for delivery in the first half 
one of the  barrel barges was placed into service in january and the second is scheduled for delivery in march during  the company entered into a contract for the construction of four horsepower towboats at a cost of approximately  of which  was paid in and  in one towboat was placed into service in the fourth quarter of  one in the first quarter of and the remaining two are scheduled for delivery in the second quarter 
in march  the company entered into a contract for the construction of twelve  barrel tank barges at a cost of approximately  in april  the company entered into contract for the construction of eight  barrel tank barges at a price of approximately  in october  the company entered into a contract for the construction of six  barrel tank barges at a cost of approximately  of the new  barrel barges under contract  will be additional capacity and six will be replacement barges for older barges removed from service 
the six  barrel barges will be additional capacity 
the company took delivery of one barge in january  with the balance anticipated throughout and in march  the company entered into a contract for the construction of four horsepower towboats at a cost of approximately  of which  was paid in and included in the capital expenditures 
delivery is scheduled for the second half 
the company projects that capital expenditures for will be in the  to  range  including approximately  for new tank barge and towboat construction 
the company remains in excellent financial position to take advantage of internal and external growth opportunities in a consolidating marine transportation industry 
external growth opportunities include potential acquisitions of independent inland tank barge operators and captive fleet owners seeking to single source tank barge requirements 
increasing the fleet size would allow the company to improve asset utilization through more backhaul opportunities  faster barge turnarounds  more efficient use of horsepower  barges positioned closer to cargoes  lower incremental costs due to enhanced purchasing power  minimal incremental administrative staff and less cleaning due to operating more barges with compatible prior cargoes 
the company anticipates that during  the united states and global economies will remain stable with continued strong demand for the transportation services of the marine transportation segment 
in  some 
table of contents incremental capacity was added to the industry fleet and the company anticipates some additional capacity will be added during critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis based on a combination of historical information and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the particular circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates based on different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the critical accounting policies that most impact the consolidated financial statements are described below 
it is also suggested that the company s significant accounting policies  as described in the company s financial statements in note  summary of significant accounting policies  be read in conjunction with this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
accounts receivable 
the company extends credit to its customers in the normal course of business 
the company regularly reviews its accounts and estimates the amount of uncollectible receivables each period and establishes an allowance for uncollectible amounts 
the amount of the allowance is based on the age of unpaid amounts  information about the current financial strength of customers  and other relevant information 
estimates of uncollectible amounts are revised each period  and changes are recorded in the period they become known 
historically  credit risk with respect to these trade receivables has generally been considered minimal because of the financial strength of the company s customers  however  a significant change in the level of uncollectible amounts could have a material effect on the company s results of operations 
property  maintenance and repairs 
property is recorded at cost 
improvements and betterments are capitalized as incurred 
depreciation is recorded on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the individual assets 
when property items are retired  sold or otherwise disposed of  the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts with any gain or loss on the disposition included in the statement of earnings 
for  and  major maintenance and repairs were charged to operating expense as incurred on an annual basis 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment by vessel class whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of the assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future net cash expected to be generated by the assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
the assumptions and estimates include  but are not limited to  estimated fair market value of the assets and estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by these assets  which are based on additional assumptions such as asset utilization  length of service the asset will be used  and estimated salvage values 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position no 
aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
this guidance prohibits the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in interim and annual financial reporting periods because an obligation has not occurred and therefore a liability should not be recognized 
the company will adopt the provisions of this guidance at the beginning of the first quarter of this change will be applied retrospectively for all consolidated financial statements presented 
the company expects that the change will have no impact on its annual consolidated financial statements but will affect its interim consolidated financial statements 
goodwill 
the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in transactions accounted for as a purchase are included in goodwill 
management monitors the recoverability of goodwill on an annual basis  or whenever events or circumstances indicate that interim impairment testing is necessary 
the amount of goodwill impairment  if any  is measured based on projected discounted future operating 
table of contents cash flows using a discount rate reflecting the company s average weighted cost of capital 
the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill will be impacted if estimated future operating cash flows are not achieved 
there are many assumptions and estimates underlying the determination of an impairment event or loss  if any 
although the company believes its assumptions and estimates are reasonable  deviations from the assumptions and estimates could produce a materially different result 
accrued insurance 
the company is subject to property damage and casualty risks associated with operating vessels carrying large volumes of bulk cargo in a marine environment 
the company maintains insurance coverage against these risks subject to a deductible  below which the company is liable 
in addition to expensing claims below the deductible amount as incurred  the company also maintains a reserve for losses that may have occurred but have not been reported to the company  or are not yet fully developed 
the company uses historic experience and actuarial analysis by outside consultants to estimate an appropriate level of reserves 
if the actual number of claims and magnitude were substantially greater than assumed  the required level of reserves for claims incurred but not reported or fully developed could be materially understated 
the company records receivables from its insurers for incurred claims above the company s deductible 
if the solvency of the insurers became impaired  there could be an adverse impact on the accrued receivables and the availability of insurance

petrochemical transportation demand for remained strong  benefiting from a continued strong united states economy 
term customers continued to operate their plants and facilities at high utilization rates  resulting in continued high barge utilization for most products and trade lanes 
black oil products demand during remained strong as refineries operated at close to full capacity  which generated heavy demand for waterborne transportation of heavier residual oil by products by barge 
refined petroleum products demand for transportation into the midwest during was strong 
during the first half of  barge availability for movements of refined petroleum products into the midwest was constrained due to the diversion of barges to the strong gulf intracoastal waterway petrochemical market to meet term contract requirements  as well as the company s continued retirement of single hull barges 
during the second half  because of the towboat shortage in the gulf intracoastal waterway  certain tank barges were diverted back to the mississippi river to meet strong demand for refined products movements into the midwest 
agricultural chemical demand was weak during  primarily due to high midwest liquid fertilizer inventory levels which reduced demand for movements of liquid fertilizer into the midwest 
as described under acquisitions above  the company acquired an additional one third interest in osprey on january   increasing the company s ownership position to  and purchased on march  the remaining in the dixie fuels partnership  bringing the company s ownership to

during  the entities contributed a combined  of marine transportation revenues 
for  the company incurred  delay days  a and improvement over the  delay days incurred in and  delay days incurred in  respectively 
the lower delay days primarily reflected unusually favorable first quarter winter weather conditions and water levels  and an improvement in the third quarter weather conditions when compared with the third quarter  which was negatively impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita 

table of contents during  approximately of marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot market revenues 
the contract and spot market mix provides the company with a predictable revenue stream while maintaining spot exposure to take advantage of new business opportunities and existing customer s peak demands 
rates under term contracts renewed during increased in the to average range  primarily the result of continued strong industry demand and high utilization of tank barges

the higher vessel personnel salaries and higher rates for chartered towboats were partly associated with hurricanes katrina and rita  which tightened the gulf coast labor pool and towboat market  and generally full united states employment 
the tight vessel labor market resulted in higher training costs as a result of increased training of vessel personnel at all levels

in addition  the segment benefited from contract and spot market increases  term contract fuel adjustments  as well as labor and consumer price index escalators effective january  on numerous multi year contracts 
the year was negatively impacted by hurricanes katrina and rita  
table of contents more fully described below 
the company estimates that the two back to back gulf coast hurricanes negatively impacted the third quarter and year by 
per share 
petrochemical transportation demand during remained strong as term contract customers continued to operate their plants and facilities at high utilization rates  resulting in high barge utilization for most products and trade lanes 
black oil products demand during was strong as refineries operated at close to full capacity  which generated demand for waterborne transportation of heavier refinery residual oil by products 
refined petroleum products volumes transported in the midwest during were generally at lower winter weather levels in the first quarter  higher levels in the second and third quarter with the summer driving season and slightly lower in the fourth quarter 
the company s presence in the refined petroleum products market was reduced during as barges were diverted to the stronger gulf intracoastal waterway petrochemical market to meet term contract requirements 
in addition  over the past several years  the company s refined petroleum products tank barge capacity has been reduced by the company s continued retirement of its single hull barges 
agricultural demand was seasonally strong during  the result of favorable demand for the movement of imported liquid fertilizer products into the midwest and south texas 
the company incurred a record  delay days during  an increase over the record  delay days incurred during during january  the company experienced high water conditions on the ohio and illinois rivers and the run off of these rivers caused high water conditions on the lower mississippi river in late january and early february 
in addition  the upper ohio river was closed for two weeks in january due to an accident at the belleville lock 
during january and february  the company also encountered numerous fog days along the gulf coast 
these inclement weather conditions and lock closures resulted in longer transit times  which delayed customer deliveries and created operating inefficiencies 
during march  weather conditions throughout the mississippi river system and the gulf intracoastal waterway improved significantly  allowing the company to efficiently meet the current demand  as well as the backlog from february 
weather conditions during the second quarter  july and the majority of august were also favorable  allowing for better asset utilization through faster barge turnarounds and more efficient use of horsepower 
hurricanes katrina and rita negatively impacted the company s operations and its financial results by an estimated 
per share 
hurricane katrina made landfall east of new orleans on august and hurricane rita made landfall on the texas louisiana border on september  thereby  significantly increasing delay days 
petrochemical and refinery facilities located in the paths or projected paths of the hurricanes shutdown operations in advance of the storms 
waterways in the hurricane affected areas were closed and the company s equipment was moved out of the path of the storms or into protected areas 
the hurricanes caused no injuries to the company s vessel crews and no notable damage to the company s tank barge and towboat fleet or its facilities 
all waterways in the hurricane affected areas were closed for a limited number of days and a majority of the petrochemical and refinery facilities impacted by the hurricanes resumed full production within a matter of weeks 
the impact of the hurricanes was mitigated to some degree by risk sharing provisions in many of the company s contracts  enabling the company to recover some of the costs related to navigational delays beyond the company s control 
in addition  some customers opted to place equipment on a time charter basis prior to the hurricanes and remained on charter through the storms 
during  approximately of marine transportation revenues were under term contracts and were spot market revenues 
contracts renewed in increased in the to average range  primarily the result of strong industry demand and higher utilization of tank barges 
spot market rates for  including fuel  for most product lines were generally higher than contract rates and were approximately to higher than spot market rates 
effective january   escalators for labor and the producer price index on numerous multi year contacts increased rates on such contracts by to 

table of contents marine transportation costs and expenses costs and expenses for increased compared with  reflecting the higher costs and expenses associated with increased marine transportation demand  as well as increased navigational delays  both noted above 
costs of sales and operating expenses for increased over the increase reflected higher salaries and related expenses  effective january   additional expenses associated with the increased demand and higher towboat and tank barge maintenance expenditures due to the substantial increase in the cost of steel during and in addition  the higher price of diesel fuel consumed  as noted below  resulted in higher fuel costs 
during  the company operated an average of towboats compared with an average of towboats during the number of towboats operated and crews required fluctuates daily  depending on the volumes moved  weather conditions and voyage times 
the company consumed million gallons of diesel fuel during  or less than the million gallons consumed in the decrease for was attributable to product mix and increased navigating delays 
for  the average price per gallon of diesel fuel consumed was  up from the average of per gallon 
term contracts contain fuel escalation clauses that allow the company to recover increases in the cost of fuel  however  there is generally a to day delay before the contracts are adjusted 
selling  general and administrative expenses for increased when compared with  primarily reflecting january  salary increases and related expenses  higher incentive compensation accruals and increased employee medical costs 
the increase was partially offset by lower professional and legal fees 
taxes  other than on income  for decreased compared with the decrease reflected lower waterway user taxes from less gallons burned in applicable waterways and a lower waterway user tax rate 
the year also reflected the favorable settlement of a multiple year property tax issue
