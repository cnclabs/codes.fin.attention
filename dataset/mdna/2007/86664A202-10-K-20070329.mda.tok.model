throughout this section  unless the context indicates otherwise  when we use the term the bank  we are referring to sun american bank 
our primary market and service area is broward  miami dade and palm beach counties where we operated twelve full service banking offices and one specialty branch office as of january  we have grown significantly in recent years due to the acquisition of certain assets  and assumption of certain liabilities  of panamerican bank in december  gulf bank in february and beach bank in since these transactions  we have pursued a growth strategy  increasing our level of earning assets  primarily through increases in the loan portfolio by concentrating on the origination of commercial loan products  by competitively pricing deposit products to grow client deposits while maintaining an interest rate spread  and by increasing the level of capital in support of this growth 
the periodic addition of new capital to support business growth is a core component required to permit us to realize growth plans 
during the year ended december   our capital base was increased by approximately million 
the capital base increased by million due to the issuance of million shares of our common stock upon the closing of the beach bank transaction 
the capital base increased a further million through the exercise of our warrants and employee stock options 
during and the first quarter of  we completed several private offerings to investors which added million and  respectively  of net new capital 
the first private placement in march of involved the sale of  units at an offering price of per unit  each of which consisted of one share of common stock and one class e warrant 
each class e warrant has a five year term and provides the holder with the right to purchase one share of common stock for 
we received net proceeds of m illion from this offering 
the other private placements involved the sale of  units at an offering price of per unit  each of which consisted of one share of common stock and one class f warrant 
each class f warrant has a five year term and provides the holder with the right to purchase share of common stock for per share 
we received net proceeds of million from this offering 
we are committed to raising additional capital as required to meet business growth requirements and maintain sun american bank s status as a well capitalized financial institution 
sun american bank s capital exceeded statutory guidelines at december  there were no dividends declared in the fiscal years ended december  and we intend to continue to expand our business through internal growth as well as through the select acquisition of the assets and assumption of deposits of other banks if and when opportunities are identified 
we will also seek to acquire other community banks in south florida subject to favorable pricing considerations although none are currently contemplated other than the proposed independent community bank acquisition 
we intend to grow internally by opening new branches  adding to our loan portfolio and bringing in new deposits 
we also intend to grow our capital base on a continuing basis as it is part of our business strategy of maintaining a well capitalized position 
we intend to pursue this business strategy while managing asset quality 
as of december   we had total assets of million  net loans of million  deposits of million and stockholders equity of million 
average total assets increased by million during the fiscal year ended december  due to management s efforts to grow sun american bank 
capital growth corresponded with the overall growth of sun american bank 
the average equity to average assets ratio increased to during the fiscal year ended december  from during the fiscal year ended december  during the first quarter of  we have reduced interest rates on select deposit products through normal operations in order to realign our rates with our business plan 
this has resulted in a decrease of client deposit balances in the period of approximately 
our results of operations are primarily dependent upon the results of operations of sun american bank 
sun american bank conducts a commercial banking business  which generally consists of attracting deposits from the general public  supplemented by federal home loan bank advances and capital infusions from us  and applying a majority of these funds typically to to the origination of commercial loans to small businesses  consumer loans  and secured real estate loans in its local trade area of south florida 
the balance of sun american bank s portfolio approximately to is generally held in cash and invested in government guaranteed or sponsored investment grade securities 
our profitability depends primarily on generating sufficient net interest income the difference between interest income received from loans and investments and the interest expense incurred on deposits and borrowings to offset operating expenses 
any excess thereof is pre tax profit earned by sun american bank 
the careful balance sought between the interest rate earned  frequency of rate changes  and interest rate paid to sun american bank s deposit base  determines the nature and extent to which it may be profitable 
for example  if the income generated by net interest income plus non interest income is in excess of operating expenses and loan loss reserves  sun american bank should be operating profitably 
non interest income consists primarily of service charges and fees on deposit accounts 
non interest expenses consist primarily of personnel compensation and benefits  occupancy and related expenses  data processing costs  deposit insurance premiums paid to the fdic  as well as other operating expenses 
one of the strategies to maintain current profits of sun american bank is to control operating expenses 
management s goal is to control the growth of operating expenses at a slower rate than the rate at which we grow our revenues 
to accomplish this goal  management continues to analyze our operations to find areas where costs can be reduced through greater efficiency or through renegotiated contracts 
in we incurred higher expenses than in prior years due to an intended expansion of our branch network and due to other investments in our business infrastructure 
we have continuously improved our profitability since net income was million for the fiscal year ended december   as compared to net income of million for the fiscal year ended december  and as compared to a net loss of  for the fiscal year ended december  earnings in the fiscal year ended december nb sp  were driven by a increase in average net loans resulting in higher net interest income and loan fees  coupled with an improved historic performance of the loan portfolio  which resulted in lower provision for loan losses 
in addition in the fiscal year ended december   we recognized a million income tax benefit as a result of a reduction in the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
this improvement in revenues and provision for loan losses was partially offset by increases in non interest expenses 
on november   the company announced that it had established sun american financial  llc  a new residential mortgage company formed as a subsidiary of sun american bank 
sun american financial  llc  will provide residential mortgage services to sun american bank s customers 
in addition  the company announced the creation of sun american wealth management  a new financial services division of sun american bank 
sun american wealth management  in partnership with uvest financial services  an nasd registered broker dealer  will provide bank customers with access to a wide variety of investment and insurance products and services 
on november   the company signed a definitive agreement to acquire independent community bank which is located in palm beach county in the city of tequesta  florida and operates a single branch 
at december   independent community bank had total assets of million 
the proposed transaction will result in an expanded presence for the company in palm beach county  serving business and retail financial needs with local decision making and serving a greater base of individuals and businesses overall 
the transaction is expected to close by the end of the first quarter of beach bank acquisition on december   the company acquired in exchange for approximately million shares subject to adjustment as described in the agreement of the company s common stock substantially all of the assets and assumed substantially all of the liabilities  of beach bank  which operated two branches in miami dade county  florida 
the exact number of shares of sun american bancorp common stock issued in the acquisition transaction will be determined based upon the book value of beach bank as set forth in the final audited closing balance sheet 
such final balance sheet of beach bank was submitted to sun american bancorp on february  and was subject to review by sun american bancorp 
sun american bancorp requested certain adjustments to the final balance sheet of beach bank 
the adjustments to the final balance sheet requested by sun american bancorp require the consent of the shareholder representative of beach bank  which was not provided 
since a dispute exists with respect to such final balance sheet between sun american bancorp and the beach bank shareholder representative  the resolution will be determined pursuant to a dispute resolution mechanism set forth in the agreement and the appropriate adjustments made to the consideration provided in the acquisition transaction 
if the adjustments to the acquisition transaction consideration based on the changes requested by sun american bancorp are accepted as a result of the arbitration proceeding  such adjustments to the final closing balance sheet will result in a reduction in the common stock issued 
there can be no assurance as to whether or in what amount adjustments will be made to the final closing balance sheet

critical accounting policies the company s accounting policies are fundamental to understanding management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition 
the company has identified five policies as being critical because they require management to make judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
allowance for loan losses the company s accounting for the allowance for loan losses is a critical policy that is discussed in detail in this section see earning assets 
goodwill and intangible assets the company tests goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually 
the test requires the company to determine the fair value of its reporting unit and compare the reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated using management valuation models 
while management believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair value estimates are reliable  different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value estimates 
these fair value estimates require a significant amount of judgment 
changes in management s valuation of its reporting unit may affect future earnings through the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
at december   the goodwill impairment testing date the fair value of its reporting unit was greater than its carrying value  therefore  goodwill was not impaired 
if the fair value of reportin g unit declines below the carrying amount  the company would have to perform the second step of the impairment test 
this step requires the company to fair value all assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
acquisitions the company accounts for its business combinations based on the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase method of accounting requires the company to fair value the tangible net assets and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
the fair values are based on available information and current economic conditions at the date of acquisition 
the fair values may be obtained from independent appraisers  discounted cash flow present value techniques  management valuation models  quoted prices on national markets or quoted market prices from brokers 
these fair values estimates will affect future earnings through the disposition or amortization of the underlying assets and liabilities 
while management believes the sources utilized to arrive at the fair value estimates are reliable  different sources or methods could have yielded different fair value estimates 
such different fair value estimates could affect future earnings through different values being utilized for the disposition or amortization of the underlying assets and liabilities acquired 
investment securities the company records its securities available for sale in its statement of financial condition at fair value 
the company uses market price quotes for valuation 
equity securities available for sale trade daily on various stock exchanges 
the fair value of these securities in the company s statement of financial condition was based on the closing price quotations at period end 
the closing quotation represents inter dealer quotations without retail markups  markdowns or commissions and do not necessarily represent actual transactions 
the number of shares that the company owns in some of these equity securities may be in excess of the securities average daily trading volume 
as a consequence  the company may not be able to realize the quoted market price upon sale 
the company adjusts its equity securities available for sale to fair value monthly with a corresponding increase or decrease to other comprehensiv e income 
declines in the fair value of individual securities available for sale below their cost that are other than temporary result in write downs of the individual securities to their fair value through the income statement 
income taxes the company files a consolidated federal income tax return 
the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are the expected future tax amounts for the temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance  if needed  reduces deferred tax amounts to the amount expected to be realized 
the company s management  in consultation with the audit committee of the board of directors of the company  has reviewed and approved these critical accounting policies 
earning assets a primary strategy of the company continues to be to increase the level of earning assets as they relate to operating expenses in order to improve profitability 
the company is pursuing a growth strategy by increasing the level of earning assets  primarily through increases in loan origination in the communities the company serves and by increasing the level of capital in support of this growth 
interest earning assets  which consist of loans  investments  federal funds sold  federal home loan bank stock  and federal reserve bank stock  totaled million at december   a million  or  increase from million at december  million or of this increase resulted from the acquisition of assets from beach bank 
earning assets of million at december   represented an million  or  increase from million at december  lending activities the company s principal lending areas have been defined as all census tracts within the tri county area of palm beach  broward and miami dade counties  florida 
the bank s customers are predominantly small to medium sized businesses and individual consumers 
collateralized loans  the most common of which follow  are extended on similar terms to all of the bank s customers and have an inherent degree of risk cash secured loans as well as loans guaranteed by agencies of the united states government represent a nominal level of risk 
loans secured by marketable securities represent a low degree of risk 
commercial and residential real estate loans  including construction and land development loans  represent a moderate degree of risk 
loans secured by automobiles  boats and equipment represent a moderate to medium level of risk to the bank 
unsecured loans represent a high level of risk to the bank 
as a significant part of the company s growth strategy  it is increasing its efforts to develop new business relationships and is increasing its marketing efforts 
typically  the company seeks commercial lending relationships with customers borrowing up to million 
the bank s legal lending limit for secured and unsecured loans was million and million as of december  the bank s legal lending limit for secured and unsecured loans was million and million as of december  and million and million as of december   respectively 
during and  the company raised and million of net new capital respectively through the acquisition of beach bank  exercise of stock options and warrants and through several share offerings thus increasing the bank s legal lending limit and allowing it to meet the loan ne eds of larger customers 
scheduled contractual principal repayments of loans do not reflect the actual life of such assets 
the average life of a loan is substantially less than its contractual terms because of prepayments 
in addition  due on sale clauses on mortgage loans generally give us the right to declare loans immediately due and payable in the event  among other things  that the borrower sells the real property subject to the mortgage and the loan is not repaid 
the average life of loans tends to increase  however  when current loan market rates are substantially higher than rates on existing loans and  conversely  decrease when rates on existing loans are substantially higher than current loan market rates 
the bank extends credit with terms  rates and fees commensurate with those in its market place for like types of credit 
loan maturities may positively or negatively impact the bank s gap position and  ultimately  its profitability 
loan solicitation and processing 
loan applicants come primarily through the efforts of the bank s loan officers who seek out existing customers  referrals by realtors  previous and present customers of the bank  business acquaintances  and walk ins 
upon receipt of a loan application from a prospective borrower  a credit report and other data are obtained to verify specific information relating to the loan applicant s employment  income and credit standing 
on mortgage loans  an appraisal of the real estate offered as collateral generally is undertaken by an independent fee appraiser certified by the state of florida 
commercial real estate loans 
the bank s primary lending focus is making commercial mortgage loans to finance the purchase of real property  which generally consists of developed real estate 
commercial mortgage loans are generally secured by first liens on real estate  and typically have variable rates and amortize over a to year period  with balloon payments due at the end of five to ten years 
at december  commercial mortgage loans represented of the total loan portfolio compared to and at december  and respectively 
the average balance of commercial mortgage loans was million for  million for and million for income from these loans totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively

year ended december  total one year or less one through five years after five years in thousands commercial commercial real estate residential real estate consumer and home equity other net deferred loan fees at december  fixed rate loans due after one year are approximately million and adjustable rate loans due after one year are approximately million 
asset quality 
management seeks to maintain a high quality of assets through conservative underwriting and sound lending practices 
the earning asset portfolio exclusive of investment securities is generally split into five categories  four of which are types of loans  and the fifth is other which includes overdrafts 
loan concentrations are defined as loans outstanding that are segregated into similar collateral types and or nature of cash flow income generation  which may cause a correspondingly similar impact with a particular economic or other condition 
we routinely monitor these concentrations in order to make necessary adjustments in lending practices that most clearly reflect the economic conditions and trends  loan ratios  loan covenants  asset valuations  and industry trends 
the percentage of loans in each category to total gross loans as of december  is as follows commercial loans commercial real estate loans residential real estate loans consumer and home equity total allowance for loan losses in an effort to maintain the quality of the loan portfolio  management seeks to minimize higher risk loans 
in view of the relative significance of real estate related loans  a downturn in the value of real estate property could have an adverse impact on profitability 
as part of the bank s loan policy and loan management strategy  we typically limit our loan to value ratio to a maximum of to depending on the type of real property being secured 
the use of qualified third party state certified appraisers for property valuations  and property inspections by knowledgeable bank officials helps mitigate real property loan risks 
the loan and discount committee of the board of directors of the bank concentrates its efforts and resources and that of its senior management and lending officers on loan review and underwriting procedures and standards 
internal controls include ongoing reviews of loans made to monitor documentation and ensure the existence and valuations of collateral  early detection of loan degradation  property inspections and review of regional economic conditions 
regulatory classification of assets 
generally  interest on loans is accrued and credited to income based on the outstanding balance of the contract obligations of each loan or receivable contract 
it is the bank s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income and classify loans or assets as non accrual when principal or interest is past due days or more and or the loan is not properly and or adequately collateralized  or if in the belief of the bank s management  principal and or interest is not likely to be paid in accordance with the terms of the obligation and or documentation 
as of december   and  delinquent loans greater than and less than days totaled million  and million  respectively 
impaired loans as at december   and totaled million  and million  respectively 
the increase was due to the downgrading of one commercial real estate construction loan that incurred cost overruns prompting the bank to advance additional funds and obtain additional collateral  as well as approximately million of impaired loans acquired in the beach bank transaction 
foreclosed assets 
assets acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure are classified as other real estate owned  or oreo  if real estate  or in other assets  if other property  until they are sold 
when property is acquired  it is initially recorded at fair value at date of acquisition 
subsequent to foreclosure  foreclosed assets are carried at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value  less estimated selling costs 
the bank held no other real estate owned and repossessions at december   and  respectively 
non performing assets 
non performing assets consist of loans that are past due days or more which are still accruing interest  loans on nonaccrual status and other real estate owned and other foreclosed assets

the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the balance sheet date 
allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes only  and the entire allowance is available to absorb probable and estimable credit losses inherent in the portfolio 
additions to the allowance may result from recording provision for loan losses or loan recoveries  while charge offs are deducted from the allowance 
management estimates the allowance for loan loss balance required by using past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  information about specific borrower situations and estimated collateral values  economic conditions  and other factors 
for analytical purposes  the allowance consists of two components  non specific and specific 
non specific allowance the methodology used in establishing non specific allowances is based on a broad risk analysis of the portfolio 
all significant portfolio segments  including concentrations  are analyzed 
the amount of the non specific allowance is based upon a statistical analysis that derives appropriate formulas  which are adjusted by management s subjective assessment of current and future conditions 
the determination includes an analysis of loss and recovery experience in the various portfolio segments over at least the last three fiscal years 
results of the historical loss analysis are adjusted to reflect current and anticipated conditions 
specific allowance all significant commercial and industrial loans classified as either substandard or doubtful are reviewed at the end of each period to determine if a specific reserve is needed for that credit 
the determination of a specific reserve for an impaired asset is evaluated in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and a specific reserve is very common for significant credits classified as either substandard or doubtful 
the establishment of a specific reserve does not necessarily mean that the credit with the specific reserve will definitely incur loss at the reserve level 
it is only an estimation of potential loss based upon anticipated events 
allowance for loan loss activity 
the allowance for loan loss as of december  was million compared to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses included an allocated allowance of  related to acquisition of a loan portfolio from beach bank 
activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years ended december  are as follows balance  beginning amounts charged off commercial consumer and home equity commercial and residential real estate recoveries of amounts charged off commercial consumer and home equity commercial and residential real estate net charge offs recoveries provision for loan losses reclassification of reserve for unfunded commitments to other liabilities acquisition related adjustment balance  ending ratio of net charge offs recoveries to average loans outstanding during the period the adjustment in and in is the allowance required on acquisition of loans from the beach bank transaction and from the gulf bank transaction  respectively 
through the normal review of the allowance for loan losses  management determined additional provision was required due to growth of the loan portfolio during and in  management discontinued the business manager product as it had determined that the product did not fit well with the current product mix 
phase out of the product was completed in the first quarter of  and the company charged off approximately  of business manager loans in in addition  management charged off an additional  of loans for which it was determined that the borrower had insufficient ability to repay 
impaired loans totaled million at december  compared to million at december  non performing assets totaled  at december  compared to  at december  management believes that the allowance for loan loss was adequate in relation to the overall loan portfolio 
the allowance is allocated to specific categories of loans for statistical purposes only  and may be applied to loan losses incurred in any loan category 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as of december  is as follows commercial loans commercial real estate loans residential real estate loans consumer and home equity total allowance for loan losses investment activities the bank is permitted under federal and state law to invest in various types of liquid assets  including us treasury obligations  securities of various federal agencies and of state and municipal governments  deposits at the federal home loan bank  certificates of deposit of federally insured institutions  certain bankers acceptances and federal funds

as a federal reserve bank member bank  we are required to maintain an investment in federal reserve bank stock 
the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank and is required to maintain an investment in federal home loan bank stock 
under state and federal regulations  a certain amount of the investments must be liquid in nature 
sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires the investments be categorized as held to maturity  trading securities or available for sale  based on management s intent as to the ultimate disposition of each security 
sfas no 
allows debt securities to be classified as held to maturity and reported in financial statements at amortized cost only if the reporting entity has the positive intent and ability to hold those securities to maturity 
securities that might be sold in response to changes in market interest rates  changes in the security s prepayment risk  increases in loan demand  or other similar factors cannot be classified as held to maturity 
debt and equity securities held for current resale are classified as trading securities 
such securities are reported at fair value  and unrealiz ed gains and losses on such securities would be included in earnings 
debt and equity securities not classified as either held to maturity or trading securities are classified as available for sale 
such securities are reported at fair value  and unrealized gains and losses on such securities are excluded from earnings and reported as a net amount in a separate component of equity 
a committee consisting of bank officers and directors determines appropriate investments in accordance with the board of directors approved investment policies and procedures 
the bank s investment policies generally limit investments to us government and agency securities  municipal bonds  certificates of deposits  marketable corporate debt obligations  mortgage backed securities and certain types of mutual funds 
the bank s investment policy does not permit engaging directly in hedging activities or purchasing high risk mortgage derivative products 
investments are made based on certain considerations  which include the interest rate  yield  settlement date and maturity of the investment  the liquidity position  and anticipated cash needs and sources which in turn include outstanding commitments  upcoming maturities  estimated deposits and anticipated loan amortization and repayments 
the effect that the proposed investm ent would have on our credit and interest rate risk  and risk based capital is also given consideration during the evaluation 
mortgage backed securities which also are known as mortgage participation certificates or pass through certificates typically represent a participation interest in a pool of single family or multi family mortgages 
the principal and interest payments on these mortgages are passed from the mortgage originators  through intermediaries generally us government agencies and government sponsored enterprises that pool and resell the participation interests in the form of securities  to investors such as the company 
such us government agencies and government sponsored enterprises  which guarantee the payment of principal and interest to investors  primarily include freddie mac  fannie mae and the government national mortgage association 
mortgage backed securities typically are issued with stated principal amounts  and the securities are backed by pools of mortgages that have loans with interest rates that fall within a specific range and ha ve varying maturities 
mortgage backed securities generally yield less than the loans that underlie such securities because of the cost of payment guarantees and credit enhancements 
in addition  mortgage backed securities are usually more liquid than individual mortgage loans and may be used to collateralize certain of the bank s liabilities and obligations 
these types of securities also permit the bank to improve its regulatory capital because they have a low risk capital weighting

liquidity 
regulatory agencies require that the bank maintain sufficient liquidity to operate in a sound and safe manner 
the principal sources of liquidity and funding are generated by the operations the bank through its diverse deposit base  loan participations and other asset liability measures 
for banks  liquidity represents the ability to meet loan commitments  withdrawals of deposit funds  and operating expenses 
the level and maturity of deposits necessary to support the lending and investment activities is determined through monitoring loan demand and through its asset liability management process 
considerations in managing the liquidity position include scheduled cash flows from existing assets  contingencies and liabilities  as well as projected liquidity conducive to efficient operations and are continuously evaluated as part of the asset liability management process 
historically  the bank has increased its level of deposits to allow for its planned asset growth 
the level of deposits is influenced by general interest rates  economic conditions and competition  among other things 
south florida is a fast growing area with intense competition from other financial service providers 
management has found that adjusting pricing  or introducing new products  produces increased deposit growth 
adjusting the rate paid on money market and now accounts can quickly adjust the level of deposits

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
sun american bank s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the exposure of financial condition to adverse movements in interest rates 
sun american bank s income is derived primarily from the excess of interest collected on interest earning assets over the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the rates of interest earned on assets and owed on liabilities generally are established contractually for a period of time 
because market interest rates change over time  sun american bank is exposed to lower profitability if it cannot adapt to interest rate changes 
accepting interest rate risk can be an important source of profitability and stockholder value  however  excessive levels of interest rate risk could pose a significant threat to sun american bank s earnings and capital base 
accordingly  effective risk management that maintains interest rate risk at pru dent levels is essential to sun american bank s safety and soundness 
sun american bank s interest rate risk is monitored using its gap analysis on a monthly basis 
we do not currently engage in trading activities or use derivative instruments to control interest rate risk 
even though such activities may be permitted with the approval of the board of directors  management does not intend to engage in such activities in the immediate future 
asset liability management 
a principal objective of sun american bank s asset liability management strategy is to minimize its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the maturity and repricing horizons of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
this strategy is overseen in part through the direction of the asset and liability committee of sun american bank that establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity 
the asset and liability committee examines the extent to which sun american bank s assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and monitors its interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will be repriced or mature within the time period analyzed  usually one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time periods 
during a period of rising interest rates  a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  and a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if the repricing of sun american bank s assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increases or decreases in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
however  as commercial banking companies generally have a significant quantity of their earning assets in rate over prime  rate adjusted day of change earning assets  gap management is critical  as very few  if any  rate sensitive liabilities deposit accounts adjust at such a rapid frequency 
the asset and liability committee evaluates sun american bank s gap position  and stratifies these results according to how often the repayment of particular assets and liabilities are impacted by changes in interest rates 
additionally  income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates  thus  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in general market rates 
additionally  certain types of earning assets variable rate mortgage loans  for example may have interest caps  which may limit the level of rate increases  even though general market interest rates increase 
gap management is further complicated by asset loan prepayment and or early withdrawal of liabilities deposits 
in volatile interest rate markets  the level of assets and liabilities assumed by sun american bank may not have accounted for the deviation that has occurred in the unpredictable interest rate environment 
therefore  management s and the asset and liability committee s strategy is to maintain a balanced interest rate risk position to protect sun american bank s net interest margin from market fluctuations 
they review  on at least a monthly basis  the maturity and repricing of assets and liabilities for the various time periods considered 
the following table represents the bank s cumulative gap position as of december  within three months zero to twelve months zero to three years zero to five years over five years total dollars in thousands assets immediately repricing investments fixed investments loans total repricing assets nonearning assets total assets liabilities now accounts money market accounts savings accounts total core deposits certificates of deposit other borrowed funds total repricing liabilities demand deposits other liabilities stockholders equity total liabilities and equity asset liability gap  cumulative rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities  cumulative target effect of government policy  future legislation and changing financial markets one of the primary determinants of the company s future success and profitability is the interest rate differentials obtained by the bank 
the bank s earning capacity will be largely controlled by the difference between the interest rate paid on its deposits and other borrowings and the interest rates received on loans to customers and securities held in its investment portfolio 
the value and yields of its assets and the rate paid on its liabilities are sensitive to changes in prevailing rates of interest 
consequently  the earnings and growth of the company will be influenced by general economic conditions  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government and policies of regulatory agencies which implement national monetary policy 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
the entire regulatory environment which controls the banking industry in the united states is undergoing s ignificant change  both as to the banking industry itself and the permissible competition between banks and non banking financial institutions 
there have been significant regulatory changes in the areas of bank mergers and acquisitions  the products and services offered by banks and the non banking activities in which bank and financial service holding companies may engage 
partly as a result of such changes  banks are now actively competing with other types of depository institutions and with non bank financial institutions such as money market funds  brokerage firms  insurance companies and other financial services organizations 
it is not possible at this time to assess what impact these changes will ultimately have on the company and its operations 
certain legislative and regulatory proposals that could affect the company are pending  or may be introduced  in the united states congress  the florida legislature and various other governmental agencies 
these proposals could further alter the structure  r egulation and competitive relationship of financial institutions and may subject the company to increased regulation  disclosure and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various banking regulatory agencies frequently propose rules and regulations to implement and enforce already existing legislation 
we cannot be predicted whether or in what form any future legislation or regulations will be enacted or to the extent to which the business of the company will be affected by such matters 
impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and accompanying footnotes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the assets and liabilities of the company are primarily monetary in nature and management believes that changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on its performance than do the effects of inflation in the current environment
