item business overview in this document  cbeyond  inc and its subsidiaries are referred to as we  the company or cbeyond 
we provide managed internet protocol based  or ip based  communications services to our target market of small businesses in select large metropolitan areas 
our services include local and long distance voice services  broadband internet access  mobile voice and data  email  voicemail  web hosting  secure backup and file sharing  fax to email  virtual private network  and other communications and it services 
in january  we began offering mobile voice and data services in conjunction with our landline based services via our mobile virtual network operator  or mvno  relationship with a nationwide wireless network provider 
our voice services other than our mobile voice and data services are delivered using voice over ip  or voip  technology and all of such services are delivered over our secure all ip network  rather than over the best efforts public internet 
our network allows us to manage quality of service and achieve network and call reliability comparable to that of traditional phone networks 

table of contents we believe our all ip network platform enables us to deliver an integrated bundle of communications services that may otherwise be unaffordable or impractical for our customers to obtain 
we manage all aspects of our service offerings for our customers  including installation  provisioning  monitoring  proactive fault management and billing 
we first launched our service in atlanta in april and now also operate in dallas  denver  houston  chicago and los angeles  and as of january  san diego 
we reported approximately million in revenue in  as compared to million in and million in we reported million of adjusted ebitda  a non gaap measure see non gaap financial measures and net income of million  on a consolidated basis in we seek to achieve positive adjusted ebitda  excluding corporate overhead  in our new markets within approximately months from launch 
we first achieved positive adjusted ebitda in atlanta  dallas  denver  houston and chicago within the targeted timeframe 
whether we achieve positive adjusted ebitda in new markets within the same timeframe depends on a number of factors  including the local pricing environment  the competitive landscape and our costs to obtain unbundled network elements from the local telephone companies in each market 
as of december   we were providing communications services to  customer locations 
our ip voip network architecture 
we deliver our services other than our mobile voice and data services over a single all ip network using a t connection 
this allows us to provide a wide array of voice and data services  attractive service features such as online additions and changes  quality of service and network and call reliability comparable to that of traditional telephone networks 
unlike traditional voice centric circuit switched communications networks  which require separate networks in order to provide voice and data services  we employ a single integrated network  which uses technologies that digitize voice communications into ip packets and converges them with other data services for transport on an ip network 
we transmit our customers voice and data traffic over our secure private network and do not use the public internet  which is employed by other voip companies such as vonage and skype technologies 
our network design exploits the convergence of voice and data services and we believe requires significantly lower capital expenditures and operating costs compared to traditional service providers using legacy technologies 
the integration of our network with our automated front and back office systems allows us to monitor network performance  quickly provision customers and offer our customers the ability to add or change services online  thus reducing our customer care expenses 
we believe that our all ip network and automated support systems enable us to continue to offer new services to our customers in an efficient manner 
beginning in the first quarter of  leveraging the flexibility of our ip network and back office systems  we integrated mobile services with our wireline services 
we currently have an arrangement with an established national mobile carrier  which provides our nationwide  privately branded mobile service offering for our beyondvoice customers 
our target market and value proposition 
our target market is businesses with to employees in large metropolitan cities  using four to forty eight lines 
according to dun bradstreet data  there are approximately million businesses with to employees in the largest markets in the united states 
as of december   we served six of these markets and planned to launch into at least five additional markets by the end of  including three new markets by the end of  of which san diego was launched in january we provide each of our integrated packages of managed services at a competitively priced  fixed monthly fee 
certain enhanced services are available as optional add ons  and we charge per minute fees for long distance telephone and mobile phone usage in excess of included plan minutes 
we believe that we provide a differentiated value proposition to our customers  most of which do not have dedicated in house resources to fully address their communications requirements  and who therefore value the ease of use and comprehensive management that we offer 
our primary competitors  the local telephone companies  do not generally offer packages of similar managed services to our target market 
we believe that this value proposition  along with our fixed length contracts  has been crucial to achieving our historical monthly customer churn rate  which averaged approximately for the year ended december  
table of contents our strategy we intend both to grow our business in our current markets and to replicate our approach in additional markets 
to achieve our goal of profitably delivering sophisticated communications tools to small businesses in our current and future markets  we have adopted a strategy with the following principal components focus solely on the small business market in large metropolitan areas 
we target small businesses  most of which do not have dedicated in house resources to address their communications requirements fully and place a high value on customer support 
by focusing exclusively on small business customers  we believe we are able to differentiate ourselves from larger service providers and deliver superior service that small business customers value 
offer comprehensive packages of managed ip and mobile communications services 
we seek to be the single source provider of our customers wireline local and long distance voice  data and mobile communications needs 
all of our customers subscribe to one of our integrated beyondvoice packages of applications 
each of our beyondvoice packages includes local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access  plus additional value added applications 
all of our services other than our mobile voice and data services are delivered over high capacity t connections 
we do not offer our local and long distance voice services  mobile or broadband internet access applications on an unbundled basis 
we offer our services  including our recently introduced mobile voice and data services  only under fixed length  flat rate contracts 
we believe that this approach results in high average revenue per customer location and a low customer churn rate 
beginning in the first quarter of  we added mobile voice and data services  including wireless email  calendar  contacts and web browsing to our service offerings 
we also plan to offer integrated mobile wireline applications such as unified messaging  one number service and simultaneous ring 
these mobile services are  and will only be  offered in conjunction with our core beyondvoice package  and we do not plan to offer mobile services on a stand alone basis 
rather  we offer our customers a bundled mobile and wireline offering with one bill and shared minutes across their business 
increase penetration of enhanced services to our customer base 
we seek to achieve higher revenue and margin per customer  increase customer productivity and satisfaction and reduce customer churn by providing enhanced services in addition to our local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access applications 
as of december   our average customer used a total of applications  whether as part of a package or purchased as an additional service 
focus sales and marketing resources on achieving significant market penetration 
we have chosen to focus our sales and marketing efforts on achieving deep market penetration and growing market share in a limited set of markets and gradually expanding the number of markets served  rather than taking an approach that emphasized having a sales presence in significantly more markets at an earlier stage in our company s history 
we believe that our targeted approach has resulted in our obtaining market share  and therefore profitability  at a faster rate and with better financial results than would have resulted from an approach that emphasized having a sales presence in significantly more markets at an earlier date 
in the future  we believe that our base of existing markets will enable us to expand into new markets at a faster pace than we have in the past 
in addition  because we prefer to develop and promote sales management from within  rather than hire from outside our company  our constantly growing base of successful markets provides a training ground for more management personnel that we can use to open new markets 
replicate our business model in new markets 
as of december   we operated in six markets and intend to expand into at least five additional markets by the end of  including three new markets by the end of  of which san diego was launched in january each time we expand into a new market  we adhere to the same process for choosing  preparing  launching and operating in those markets 
in launching our business in each new market  we use the same disciplined financial and operational reporting system to enable us to closely monitor our costs  market penetration and provisioning of customers and maintain consistent standards across all of our markets 

table of contents our strengths our business is focused on rapidly growing a loyal customer base  while maintaining capital and operating efficiency 
we believe we benefit from the following strengths our all ip network 
we are able to provide a wide range of enhanced communications services in a cost efficient manner over a single network  in contrast to traditional communications providers  which may require separate  incremental networks or substantial network upgrades in order to support similar services 
our all ip network architecture allows us to provide a comprehensive package of managed communications services including voip  with high network reliability and high quality of service 
capital efficiency 
we believe that our business approach requires lower capital and operating expenditures to bring our markets to positive cash flow compared to communications carriers using legacy technologies and operating processes 
in addition  our deployment of capital is largely success based  meaning we incur incremental capital only as our customer base grows 
historically  a substantial majority of our market specific capital expenditures have been success based 
our automated and integrated business processes 
we believe that the combination of our disciplined approach to sales  installation and service together with our automated business processes allow us to streamline our operations and maintain low operating costs 
our front and back office systems are highly automated and are integrated to synchronize multiple tasks  including installation  billing and customer care 
we believe this allows us to lower our customer service costs  efficiently monitor the performance of our network and provide automated and responsive customer support 
our highly regimented but personalized sales model 
we believe we have a distinctive approach to recruiting  training and deploying our direct sales representatives  which ensures a uniform sales culture and an effective means of acquiring new customers 
our direct sales representatives follow a disciplined daily schedule and meet face to face with customers each day as part of a transaction oriented  but personalized and consultative  selling process 
our experienced management team with focus on operating excellence 
our senior management team has substantial industry experience 
our top three executive officers have an average of over years of experience in the communications industry and have worked at a broad range of communications companies  both at startups and mature businesses  including local telephone companies  long distance carriers  competitive carriers  web hosting companies  internet and data providers and mobile communications providers 
our strong balance sheet and liquidity position 
as of december   we had a strong balance sheet with over million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and no debt 
we believe that cash flows from operations and cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our capital expenditures and operating expenses  including those related to our current plans to expand into at least five additional markets by the end of  including three new markets by the end of  of which san diego was launched in january in addition  we have an open  undrawn million revolving line of credit with bank of america  secured by substantially all of our assets 
we believe our strategies and strengths have contributed to our financial and operating performance  including high revenue growth  attractive average revenue per customer location and low customer churn 
our customers we are targeting entrepreneurial class businesses  or those with to employees in certain of the largest metropolitan markets in the united states 
according to dun bradstreet data  there are approximately million businesses with to employees in the largest markets in the united states 
we are focusing on these markets because of their high concentration of small businesses 
we believe that focusing on these markets will allow us to maximize the resources we can apply by operating in the densest areas of small business in the united states 
as of december   we were providing communications services to  customer locations 

table of contents the majority of our target customers currently receive communications services from the incumbent local telephone companies  and many of these businesses have more than one provider for the basic services of local and long distance voice services and internet access 
these businesses  in most cases  do not receive the focus and personalized attention that larger enterprises enjoy and often lag behind larger businesses in the adoption of productivity enhancing and cost effective service offerings 
the small businesses we target typically lack affordable access to a t broadband connection and typically do not have dedicated in house resources to manage their communications needs 
a majority of our customer base uses to local voice lines  although the larger size customers in our range represent an increasing percentage of the total 
because we focus solely on small businesses  no single customer or group of customers represents a significant percentage of our customer base or revenues 
similarly  no single vertical customer segment represents a significant percentage of our base 
our largest customer sectors are professional services  which includes physicians  legal offices  banking institutions  consulting firms  accounting firms and real estate 
each of these individually represents less than of our customer base 
we believe that small businesses look for the following characteristics in choosing a service provider competitive pricing  focus on small business solutions  dedicated customer care  a simplified  single bill and comprehensive service management 
our managed service offerings integrated service offerings we offer integrated managed communications services through our beyondvoice packages  which are provided over one to three dedicated t connections 
the beyondvoice packages are essentially a single basic product offered in three sizes  depending on the customer s size and need for bandwidth beyondvoice i beyondvoice ii beyondvoice iii customer profile businesses with to lines typically to employees businesses with to lines typically to employees businesses with to lines typically to employees with high bandwidth needs broadband connection one dedicated t connection two dedicated t connections three dedicated t connections number of voice lines landlines or landlines mobile line or landlines mobile lines included local minutes per month unlimited unlimited unlimited included domestic long distance minutes per month internet access speed up to mbps  unlimited monthly usage speed up to mbps  unlimited monthly usage speed up to mbps  unlimited monthly usage each of our beyondvoice packages includes local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access  plus a full line of managed services our customers can choose from to customize their package 
beginning in the first quarter of  we incorporated mobile services into our beyondvoice i package offering 
the local and long distance voice services in our beyondvoice packages include enhanced services  which are comparable to the services offered over traditional telephone networks  and business class features  which include call forwarding  call hunting  call transfer  call waiting  caller id and three way calling 

table of contents enhanced services in addition to the applications offered in our beyondvoice packages  we currently offer other services  which include voicemail  email  web hosting  virtual private network  beyondmobile  beyondoffice  secure backup and file sharing  fax to email  and other applications and features 
in the future  we plan to offer other applications  such as network security  calendar share  secure desktop  and integrated mobile wireline applications  such as unified messaging  one number service and simultaneous ring 
our enhanced services are sold on an a la carte basis to subscribers of our beyondvoice bundled packages 
sales and marketing overview our sales force targets small businesses that have to employees and four to forty eight phone lines 
we believe that the traditional local telephone companies have not concentrated their sales and marketing efforts on this business segment 
our direct sales representatives meet face to face with customers each day as part of a transaction oriented  but personalized and consultative  selling process 
we adhere to the same sales and operating procedures in every market we enter 
we track the performance of our sales team by maintaining detailed activity measurements in each of our markets 
we offer our customers a comprehensive communications solution that is simplified into three beyondvoice packages sold at fixed  predetermined prices 
we permit our sales people to sell only our offered packages and do not allow them to make discounted sales or alter the beyondvoice packages other than to add enhanced services or in connection with company wide promotions 
we believe that value is the primary motivating factor for our customers 
we believe that our commitment to offering integrated packages of services helps to simplify the entry of orders into our automated provisioning and installation process 
through our strategy of offering bundled services  we seek to become the single source provider of our customers wireline and mobile communications services 
we believe these factors contribute to our low customer churn rate 
sales channels direct sales 
the cornerstone of our sales efforts is our direct sales force 
at full staffing  we target to sales representatives per market 
our direct sales force accounted for approximately of our year to date sales through december  we believe we have a distinctive approach to recruiting and training our direct sales representatives which ensures a uniform sales approach and a consistent measure of revenue targets 
we typically recruit individuals without prior telecommunications sales experience so that we can exclusively provide all of their formal training 
the ongoing nature of our training is an essential part of our business strategy 
we require our sales personnel to maintain a regimented daily schedule of training  appointment setting and face to face meetings with customers  resulting in a transaction oriented  but personalized and consultative  selling process 
a substantial part of the compensation for our sales force is based on commission 
we reinforce our clear expectations of success through a system of increasing quotas and advancement for those who succeed 
we promote from within and develop our own sales management talent from promising sales representatives  who have the opportunity to advance as we grow 
national sales 
in we established a national sales group in order to respond to web based and telephone inquiries from customer prospects in our markets 
in addition to telephone based sales to these prospects  the national sales group evaluates and forwards potential customer prospects to our direct sales representatives 
our national sales group accounted for approximately of our year to date sales through december  
table of contents indirect sales 
we supplement our direct sales force and our national sales force with our channel partners  who leverage their preexisting business relationships with the customer and act as sales agents for us 
the channel partners include value added resellers  local area network consultants and other it and telecommunications consultants to small businesses 
as compensation for their services  our channel partners receive ongoing residual payments on their sales 
at full staffing  we target four indirect sales representatives per market  and our channel partners contributed approximately of our year to date sales through december  referrals program we believe we are building a culture of referrals that benefits both our direct and indirect selling efforts 
we obtain approximately one third of our new customers from our referral program through our current base of customers and through our referral partners 
our customers and referral partners are eligible to receive a one time referral credit for each new customer they refer 
marketing and advertising we focus our marketing resources on our direct and indirect sales efforts and programs that support those efforts 
we market ourselves as the last communications company a small business will ever need 
we have launched a focused marketing campaign of targeted direct mail  print and online media but have not committed our resources to traditional brand advertising 
our marketing expenses for the year ended december  were million 
operations once a customer is signed  we believe we provide a highly differentiated customer experience in each aspect of the service relationship 
our highly automated and optimized business processes are designed to provide rapid and reliable installation  accurate billing and responsive  x care and support using both web enabled and human resources 
we continue to put emphasis on customer service as a key differentiator to drive customer satisfaction and customer referrals for new business 
our vp customer experience executive management position focuses on defining the overall customer experience across all customer touch points and the implementation of a cohesive program to ensure customer satisfaction and higher customer retention rates 
this customer experience focus has also contributed to continued improvements in our automated care and support capabilities used to service our customers and increase our operational efficiency 
installation we employ a team of service coordinators in each of our markets to handle the order entry and customer installation process 
a centralized circuit provisioning and customer activation group takes responsibility for ensuring that t circuits from the local telephone company to the customer s location are provisioned correctly and on time  together with local number portability and the appropriate features and applications ordered by the customer 
we seek to provision our beyondvoice i customers within calendar days  our beyondvoice ii and beyondvoice ii plus customers within calendar days and our beyondvoice iii customers within calendar days 
our automated processes allow us to reduce the time and human intervention necessary to fill our circuit orders with the local telephone company 
currently  a majority of all circuit orders receive a firm order commitment from the local telephone company with no human intervention in less than hours from submission 
once an order is submitted  an outsourced technician is dispatched to the customer s location to install the integrated access device  to connect the customer s equipment to our network  and to activate and test the services 
after installation of the integrated access device  new services added by the customer will work with the customer s existing equipment and require no further equipment changes or capital expenditures 

table of contents billing we bill all of our customers electronically 
our customers receive their bill due information via email 
full billing detail and analytical capabilities are available to our customers on the web through our cbeyond online website 
we do not send any paper bills 
in addition  over of our customers pay us online  either via credit card  electronic funds transfer  or automatic account debit 
because we employ flat rate billing in advance  customers are able to budget their costs  billing is simplified and errors are kept to a minimum 
because billing related calls are often the largest percentage of calls to customer care among communications service providers  our approach to billing greatly reduces the amount of resources needed in our customer care organization 
moreover  our automated systems enable us to easily disconnect and reconnect our services  which assists us in effectively collecting unpaid bills 
customer care and cbeyond online we offer our customers x support through live access to dedicated care representatives and through online resources 
although customers can choose to speak with one of our cbeyond representatives on a real time basis  cbeyond online has become our primary channel for customer care 
we offer a broad range of capabilities online  including functions allowing customers to review their requested services and accept their installation order for new customers  view  pay and analyze their bills  view and modify their services and account features  view and modify account information  research products and troubleshoot issues using the section of our web site devoted to frequently asked questions  which we call our find it fast knowledge base  and submit requests for account changes 
underpinning our care and support operations is a network that provides our customers with reliable and high quality service 
our network operations group manages and tracks network performance 
we have deployed state of the art network monitoring and diagnostic tools to provide our care representatives and network operations center personnel with real time insight into problem areas and the information needed to address them 
our all ip network architecture we deliver our services other than our mobile voice and data services over our single all ip network using t connections to connect customers to our network 
this allows us to provide a wide array of voice and data services  attractive service features such as real time online adds and changes  and network reliability and call quality comparable to that of traditional telephone networks 
unlike traditional voice centric circuit switched communications networks  we employ a single integrated network using technologies that digitize voice communications into ip packets and converge them with other data services for transport on an ip network 
we transmit our customers voice traffic over our secure private network and do not rely on the best efforts public internet 
our network design exploits the convergence of voice and data services and requires significantly lower capital expenditures and operating costs compared to traditional service providers using legacy technologies 
the integration of our network with our automated front and back office systems allows us to monitor network performance  quickly provision customers and offer our customers the ability to add or change services online  thus reducing our customer care expenses 
we believe that our all ip network and automated support systems enable us to continue to offer new services to our customers in an efficient manner 

table of contents there are two distinct strategies that carriers adopt in deploying voip services voice as an application over the public internet 
because calls are carried over the public internet and not over a private network such as ours  service is often provided on a best efforts basis 
these service providers focus mainly on the consumer market 
we believe that these offerings may lack the call quality  network reliability  security and service features that business customers require 
our managed ip network 
we have deployed an all ip network over which voice calls primarily travel over a managed ip connection as opposed to the public internet 
this approach allows us to deliver quality of service similar to the quality of a public switched telephone network 
in our model  voice is an application over a private data network 
initially  all of our customers connected to our beyondvoice service via their existing analog premise equipment 
for those original customers  as well as any new customers using their existing analog premise equipment  we install and manage an integrated access device on the customer s premise that converts voip traffic to analog time division multiplexing  or tdm  and interconnects with the customer s phone system via digital or analog connections 
by interconnecting with the customer s existing tdm based phone system  we significantly minimize the investment required to switch to our voip service  simplify the installation of our service and greatly reduce the sales lead time 
while the majority of our new customers still connect to our service via their existing analog premise equipment  over the past two years  we have observed a steady increase in the deployment of ip based phone systems in the small business market 
according to several industry analysts  the sales of ip based phone systems have recently surpassed that of the traditional tdm phone systems 
many of these ip based phone systems  or ip pbxs  use a standards based and highly flexible protocol called session initiation protocol  or sip  and provide significant cost savings and increased functionality 
one of the key benefits for many small businesses is that they now have access to direct inward dial  or did  capability 
dids allow each employee to have their own direct phone number and not just an extension 
the availability of dids allows the end user to take advantage of many productivity enhancing applications such as unified messaging  auto attendant  integrated voicemail  selective call routing and much more 
in early  we began offering our beyondvoice with sip connect service that allows customers to connect their ip pbx to our integrated access device directly via sip rather than traditional analog or digital 
direct sip peering between a customer s ip pbx and our voip network eliminates the need for the customer to purchase a tdm gateway  significantly reducing their hardware investment 
sip peering also eliminates the voip to tdm conversions which reduces the voice traffic latency  thereby increasing the voice quality 
end to end sip signaling and a pure ip bearer path lay the foundation for richer communication services than offered by the public switched telephone network today  which are essential to the future of packet based communications and the delivery of productivity enhancing applications 
the main advantage of our ip network architecture is its low cost structure relative to traditional circuit switched networks 
our more efficient single network approach enables us  relative to the historical experiences of legacy carriers  to buy fewer network components and at lower cost  lease fewer telecommunications circuits  employ fewer staff  rent less colocation space  incur lower maintenance costs  and integrate fewer support systems 

table of contents legacy competitive carriers often manage numerous overlapping and interconnected network technologies to provide the package of services that we provide on our single all ip network 
legacy network architectures can include a circuit switched local or long distance voice network  digital subscriber line  ip and frame relay data transmission networks  and asynchronous transfer mode and synchronous optical network intracity transport networks 
these different legacy networks generally require the expense and complexity of dedicated circuits and network transmission and monitoring equipment 
we believe that we benefit from the efficiency of being able to provide all our services over a single network 
one of the benefits of our ip network is the ability to integrate voice and data packets seamlessly 
bandwidth for voice is dynamically allocated  which allows the customer to enjoy full access to the mbps of bandwidth a t connection affords when no voice traffic is present on the access circuit 
when a customer activates a voice line  the allocated bandwidth automatically adjusts to allow the caller the amount of the t connection needed to process the call 
this feature allows us to provide increased speed and performance to our customers in their internet usage while assuring high quality voice service 
because legacy time division multiplexing service providers must dedicate fixed portions of their customer circuits to voice and data  they are unable to employ dynamic bandwidth allocation 
we organize our network into three groupings of equipment and circuits for purposes of network management and quality measurement the core network  which is located in our data centers and primarily comprises softswitches  backbone routers and media and feature servers  the distribution network  which includes colocation equipment such as t aggregation routers and trunking gateways  as well as ds transport circuits  and the access network  which comprises the t local loops and integrated access devices that connect customers equipment to our extended network 
our software monitors network quality and tracks potential problems by monitoring each of these network groupings 
the largest single monthly expense associated with our network is the cost of leasing t circuits to connect to our customers 
we lease t s primarily from the local telephone companies on a wholesale basis using unbundled network element  or une  loops or enhanced extended links 
an une enhanced extended link consists of a t loop connected to the interoffice transport unbundled network element 
this design allows us to obtain the functionality of a t loop without the need for colocation in the local telephone company s serving office 
we are able to take advantage of t une loop and une enhanced extended links and the associated cost based pricing of each because we meet certain qualifying criteria established by the federal communications commission  or the fcc  for use of these services and because we have built the processes and systems to take advantage of these wholesale circuits  in contrast to many competitive carriers  which lease t circuits under special access  or retail  pricing 
as a result of regulatory changes adopted via the fcc s triennial review remand order  or trro  we are required to lease t circuits under special access pricing when serving customers in certain geographical areas within the cities we serve 
see government regulation 
we employ these wholesale t circuits as follows une loops 
a une loop is the facility that extends from the customer s premises to our equipment colocated in the local exchange company end office that serves that customer location 
we employ une loops when we have a colocation in the central office that serves a customer 
we use high capacity t unbundled loops to serve our customers 
enhanced extended links 
an enhanced extended link is a combination of an unbundled t loop and an associated t transport element that are joined together by the local telephone company at the end office serving the customer location 
this allows us to obtain access to customer premises without having a colocation at the serving central office 
the current fcc rules require local telephone 
table of contents companies to provide t enhanced extended links to carriers subject to certain local use criteria  which we meet 
once we achieve sufficient density from a remote office  we deploy a dedicated ds transport and regroom the t transport elements onto the ds and remove the t transport elements 
historically  approximately half of our circuits were provisioned using une loops and half using enhanced extended links 
our monthly expenses are significantly less when using une loops rather than enhanced extended links  but une loops require us to incur the capital expenditures of central office colocation equipment 
both une loops and enhanced extended links are substantially less expensive for us than special access circuits 
we lease ds circuits from local telephone companies or competitive carriers to carry traffic from the end office colocation to our equipment in a tandem wire center colocation 
we install central office colocation equipment in those central offices having the densest concentration of small businesses 
we usually launch a market with several colocations and add colocations as the business grows 
for example  in atlanta  our most mature market  we had colocations at the time of our initial public offering in november and colocations as of december  our voip technology allows us to concentrate approximately five times as many t circuits onto our ds transport circuits as legacy time division multiplexing providers 
specifically  we can dynamically allocate available transport bandwidth and can converge and mix voice and data traffic on the network  which offers us significant cost savings 
our software based voip architecture also provides the flexibility to add services and change features quickly  in contrast to legacy providers whose systems have historically required them to make time consuming physical moves  adds and changes 
we believe that our all ip  private network is optimized to deliver services in an efficient  flexible and cost effective manner 
front and back office systems architecture we have combined our streamlined business processes with best in class commercial software packages that we have integrated to create a platform for delivery of our automated front and back office systems 
we believe that the integration of our ip network with our front and back office platform supports an efficient cost structure 
these are the cornerstones of our it strategy deploying commercial software applications and making use of application service providers instead of building our own custom software  operating a single customer facing system tightly integrated with back office provisioning  activation and billing systems  using automated and web interfaces to extend our business processes to customers and partners  and embedding business process management throughout our front and back office platform 
we believe that the software packages we have deployed are scalable  based on successful implementation and operation of such software packages by much larger enterprises with greater volumes of transactions 
in addition  they can be customized by the incorporation of our specially tailored business processes 
we enjoy the advantages of third party maintenance and updates from companies with substantial research and development staffs 
underlying our entire front and back office systems architecture is a comprehensive set of enterprise application integration code  with siebel workflow and standard messaging and communications tools handling the majority of the interfaces 

table of contents our front office systems consist of customer relationship management 
we use siebel s customer relationship management software to handle sales force automation  sales order entry  order management  commissions  customer care  field service functions  integrated access device management and channel partner relationship management 
online customer self service 
our web enabled customer self service capabilities allow cbeyond customers to manage and pay their cbeyond bill  manage their cbeyond account including submitting service requests  manage and change cbeyond delivered applications  and obtain support 
cbeyond leverages commercially available software to deliver these capabilities to our customers 
our back office systems consist of provisioning 
we use application service providers as a common gateway with local telephone companies and third party databases  including circuit orders  local number portability  and emergency number provisioning 
activation 
we have licensed software that handles our network inventory and activation functions  and we have an outsourcing arrangement with a third party to provide telephone number inventory functions 
billing 
billing and payment processing are conducted through software we have licensed  and we handle billing mediation functions through other licensed software 
relationship with cisco systems cisco systems supplies our voip network technology 
when we began our business in  we evaluated a number of softswitch technologies and voip platforms 
as a result  we determined that cisco systems softswitch represented the most advanced softswitch for our needs  incorporating business class features that business users require with a higher degree of reliability and sophistication than other competing technologies 
in addition  we chose a single vendor solution in an effort to mitigate the risk of integrating equipment from multiple vendors in a relatively new technology 
we believe that the risk of integrating competing products has greatly diminished  and we will deploy those products with the best combination of price and performance going forward  whether from cisco systems or competing manufacturers 
competition as a managed services provider in the communications industry  we broadly compete with companies that could provide both voice and enhanced services to small businesses in our markets 
as a provider of voice services  our primary competitors are the incumbent local phone companies qwest communications international  inc in denver and at t  inc 
in atlanta  dallas  houston  chicago and los angeles 
based on information provided by our customers at the time of activation  approximately of our customers used an incumbent local telephone company for local telephone service prior to signing with us  and the remainder used competitive local telephone companies 
many of our customers  prior to joining with us  used multiple vendors for local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access and have enjoyed the convenience of a sole sourced service since signing with us 
in addition to the local telephone companies  we compete with other competitive carriers in each of our markets 
these competitive carriers include covad communications group  inc  xo communications  llc  nuvox communications  us lec corp  mcleod usa incorporated  eschelon telecom  inc  and itc deltacom  inc  among many others 
certain of these competitive carriers have adopted voip technology similar to that employed by us  and in the future we expect others to do so 
in addition  there are other providers using voip technology  such as vonage holdings corp  skype technologies sa  a subsidiary of ebay  inc  deltathree  inc 
and x  inc  which offer service using the public internet to access their customers 
we do not currently view these companies as our direct competitors because 
table of contents they primarily serve the consumer market and businesses with fewer than four lines 
certain cable television companies  such as cox communications  inc  comcast cable communications  inc  timewarner cable  inc and cablevision systems corp  have deployed voip primarily to address consumers and to compete better against local telephone companies for residential customers  although each of these companies does offer packaged services to small business customers 
certain other voip based companies  such as netphone  inc and ibasis  inc 
have built business models based on wholesale voip services to companies that do not wish to develop or wholly operate their own voip services 
we do not view netphone and other voip wholesalers as competitors  given their consumer focus 
we expect that  in the future  other companies may be formed to take advantage of our voip based business model 
existing companies may also expand their focus in the future to target small business customers 
in addition  certain utility companies have begun experimenting with delivering voice and high speed data services over power lines 
in connection with our beyondmobile offering  we compete with national wireless phone companies  such as cingular wireless llc  sprint nextel corporation  t mobile usa  inc and verizon wireless  as well as regional wireless providers 
government regulation our communications services business is subject to the statutory framework established by congress  state legislatures and varying degrees of federal  state and local regulation 
in contrast to certain other ip based carriers  we have elected to operate as a common carrier and thus our business does not rely on the regulatory classification of  or regulatory treatment for  ip based carriers in particular 
as a common carrier  we are subject to the jurisdiction of both federal and state regulatory agencies  which have the authority to review our prices  terms and conditions of service 
the regulatory agencies exercise minimal control over our prices and services  but do impose various obligations such as reporting  payment of fees and compliance with consumer protection and public safety requirements 
in addition  it is possible that  in limited circumstances  we will be subject to requirements placed on interconnected voip providers in addition to the requirements we are subject to as a common carrier 
we operate as a facilities based carrier and have received all necessary state and fcc authorizations to do so 
unlike resale carriers  we do not rely upon access to incumbent local exchange carrier switching facilities or capabilities 
as a facilities based carrier  we have undertaken a variety of regulatory obligations  including for example providing access to emergency systems  permitting law enforcement officials access to our network upon proper authorization  contributing to the cost of the fcc s and  where applicable  the state universal service programs and making our services accessible to persons with disabilities 
by operating as a common carrier  we also benefit from certain legal rights established by federal legislation  especially the federal telecommunications act of  or the telecom act  which gives us and other common carrier competitive entrants the right to interconnect to the networks of incumbent telephone companies and access to elements of their networks on an unbundled basis 
these rights are not available to providers who do not operate as common carriers 
we have used these rights to gain interconnection with the incumbent telephone companies and to purchase selected unbundled network elements  or unes  at prices based on incremental cost  especially t loop unes that provide us access to our customers premises 
congress  the fcc and state regulators are considering a variety of issues that may result in changes in the statutory and regulatory environment in which we operate our business 
several bills have been introduced regarding telecommunications issues such as net neutrality  but none would have any impact on our right to purchase unes 
while negative federal legislation is always a possibility  we believe it unlikely that any such negative legislation will be passed by congress in the fcc s current rules  as established in the august triennial review order and subsequent orders discussed below  establish the general framework of regulation that allows us to purchase the unes that we buy 
in addition  some of the changes under consideration by congress  the fcc and state regulators may affect our competitors differently than they affect us 
for example  the fcc s elimination of the une p rules several years ago affected resale carriers that seek to 
table of contents compete against us  but elimination of those rules did not affect us  because we never relied on une p as a part of our business model 
changes in the universal service fund may affect the fees we are required to pay to contribute to funding this program  but since we and our competitors generally pass these fees through to customers  we expect any changes to have minimal competitive effect 
similarly  we do not expect changes in inter carrier compensation rules to have a material effect on us because we derive the vast majority of our revenues directly from our customers  rather than from other carriers 
we do not collect reciprocal compensation for termination of local calls  and we derive relatively little revenue from access charges for origination and termination of long distance calls over our network 
the colorado commission has also recently initiated an investigation of certain une rates which may include a review of t and ds unes 
if these unes are included in the review  it is possible that we would be subject to future rate increases 
the fcc has adopted new regulations governing voip services 
although we use voip technology extensively in our network  the new rules have more impact on service providers who do not currently operate as common carriers 
this is because the fcc has now subjected voip providers to obligations that we have already undertaken to fulfill due to our status as a common carrier 
for example  the fcc adopted rules that require interconnected voip providers to enable all customers to access emergency services  to contribute to the federal universal service fund and to provide certain capabilities for the monitoring of communications by properly authorized law enforcement agencies 
we believe that these rules affect potential competitors more than they affect us  because we are already subject to universal service obligations  provide access and law enforcement access capabilities in compliance with the requirements that apply to common carriers 
such requirements are subjects of ongoing review by both congress and the fcc that could result in additional obligations over time 
although the nature and effects of governmental regulation are not predictable with certainty  we believe that the fcc is unlikely to adopt rules that extinguish our basic right or ability to compete in the telecommunications markets and that any rule changes that affect us will likely be accompanied by transition periods sufficient to allow us to adjust our business practices accordingly 
the following sections describe in more detail the regulatory developments described above and other regulatory matters that may affect our business 
regulatory framework our business relies heavily on the use of t une loops and une enhanced extended links  or eels  that include t loop components  for access to customer premises 
our existing strategy is based on fcc rules that require incumbent local exchange carriers to provide us these unes at wholesale prices based on incremental costs 
as a result of a court decision  the fcc issued rules  which became effective on march   limiting the obligation of incumbent local exchange carriers to provide unes in certain circumstances 
the new rules require  among other things  that incumbent local exchange carriers continue providing t une loops in most situations  but not in high density central offices 
this exception affects the price we pay to obtain access to t loops in some of the central business districts we serve  as discussed in more detail below 
on june   the dc court of appeals upheld the fcc s new rules in their entirety 
these rules may nevertheless change at any time due to future fcc decisions  and we are unable to predict how such future developments may affect our business 
the telecom act the telecom act  which substantially revised the communications act of  established the regulatory preconditions to allow companies like us to compete for the provision of local communications services 
before the passage of the telecom act  states typically granted an exclusive franchise in each local service area to a single dominant carrier  often a former subsidiary of at t  known as a regional bell operating company  which owned the entire local exchange network and operated a virtual monopoly in the provision of most local exchange services 
the regional bell operating companies  following some recent consolidation including at t finalizing its purchase of bellsouth at the end of  now consist of verizon  qwest communications and at t communications 

table of contents among other things  the telecom act preempts state and local governments from prohibiting any entity from providing communications service on a common carrier basis  which has the effect of eliminating prohibitions on entry that existed in almost half of the states at the time the telecom act was enacted 
at the same time  the telecom act preserved state and local jurisdiction over many aspects of local telephone service and  as a result  we are subject to varying degrees of federal  state and local regulation 
the telecom act provided the opportunity to accelerate the development of competition at the local level by  among other things  requiring the incumbent carriers to cooperate with competitors entry into the local exchange market 
to that end  incumbent local exchange carriers are required to allow interconnection of their networks with competitive networks 
incumbent local exchange carriers are further required by the telecom act to provide access to certain elements of their network to competitive local exchange carriers 
we have developed our business  including being designated as a common carrier  and designed and constructed our networks to take advantage of the features of the telecom act that require cooperation from the incumbent carriers 
we believe that the continued viability of the provisions relating to these matters is critical to the success of the competitive regime contemplated by the telecom act 
there have been numerous attempts to revise or eliminate the basic framework for competition in the local exchange services market through a combination of federal legislation  new fcc rules  and challenges to existing and proposed regulations by the incumbent carriers 
we anticipate that congress will consider a range of proposals to modify the telecom act over the next few years  including some proposals that could restrict or eliminate our access to elements of the incumbent local exchange carriers networks 
we consider it unlikely  however  that congress would reverse the fundamental policy of encouraging competition in communications markets 
congress may also consider legislation that would address the impact of the internet on the telecom act 
such legislation could seek to clarify the regulations applicable to voip and internet providers 
we believe that such legislation is unlikely to result in the imposition of new regulatory obligations on us  although it is possible that it will eliminate certain regulatory obligations that apply to us as a result of our status as a common carrier 
federal regulation the fcc regulates interstate and international communications services  including access to local communications networks for the origination and termination of these services 
we provide interstate and international services on a common carrier basis 
the fcc requires all common carriers to obtain an authorization to construct and operate communications facilities and to provide or resell communications services  between the united states and international points 
we have secured authority from the fcc for the installation  acquisition and operation of our wireline network facilities to provide facilities based domestic and international services 
the fcc imposes extensive economic regulations on incumbent local exchange carriers due to their ability to exercise market power 
the fcc imposes less regulation on common carriers without market power including  to date  competitive local exchange carriers 
unlike incumbent carriers  our retail services are not currently subject to price cap or rate of return regulation 
we are therefore free to set our own prices for end user services subject only to the general federal guidelines that our charges for interstate and international services be just  reasonable and non discriminatory 
we have filed tariffs with the fcc containing interstate rates we charge to long distance carriers for access to our network  also called interstate access charges 
the rates we can charge for interstate access  unlike our end user services  are limited by fcc rules 
we are also required to file periodic reports  to pay regulatory fees based on our interstate revenues and to comply with fcc regulations concerning the content and format of our bills  the process for changing a customer s subscribed carrier and other consumer protection matters 
the fcc has the authority to impose monetary forfeitures and to condition or revoke a carrier s operating authority for violations of these requirements 
our operating costs are increased by the need to assure compliance with these regulatory obligations 

table of contents the telecom act is intended to increase competition 
specifically  the telecom act opens the local services market by requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to permit interconnection to their networks and establishing incumbent local exchange carrier obligations with respect to interconnection with the networks of other carriers  provision of services for resale  unbundled access to elements of the local network  arrangements for local traffic exchange between both incumbent and competitive carriers  number portability  access to phone numbers  access to rights of way  dialing parity and colocation of communications equipment in incumbent central offices 
incumbent local exchange carriers are required to negotiate in good faith with carriers requesting any or all of these arrangements 
if the negotiating carriers cannot reach agreement within a prescribed time  either carrier may request binding arbitration of the disputed issues by the state regulatory commission 
where an agreement has not been reached  incumbent local exchange carriers remain subject to interconnection obligations established by the fcc and state communications regulatory commissions 
the telecom act also permitted a regional bell operating company to enter the long distance market within its local telephone service area upon showing that certain statutory conditions set forth in section of the telecom act have been met and upon obtaining fcc approval 
the fcc has approved regional bell operating company petitions for in region long distance for every state in the nation  and each regional bell operating company is now permitted to offer long distance service to its local telephone customers 
the fcc subsequently relieved the regional bell operating companies  or rboc  of some of the conditions imposed for section long distance approval  including in particular conditions that impose obligations to provide access to broadband although not t unes beyond what the fcc has required in its triennial review order  or tro  and triennial review remand order  or trro  which are discussed below in more detail 
while we do not currently use any unes obtained exclusively under section long distance entry conditions  we may seek to do so in the future 
as a result of the state commission reviews to implement the fcc s tro trro decisions  some states eg  georgia  illinois and california have adopted rules to implement the requirement that rbocs provide competitors with access to network elements pursuant to section some states  like georgia  have also adopted rules setting the rates that an rboc must charge for such network elements 
the fcc is currently considering whether to preempt such state regulation of unes offered exclusively under section triennial review order and appeals 
as discussed above  we rely on provisions of the telecom act that require the incumbent local exchange carriers to provide competitors access to elements of their local network on an unbundled basis  known as unes 
the telecom act requires that the fcc consider whether competing carriers would be impaired in their ability to offer telecommunications services without access to particular unes 
in the tro of august  the fcc substantially revised its rules interpreting and enforcing the une requirements  while maintaining the general regulatory framework under which we purchase our unes 
the fcc also adopted new eligibility requirements for the use of une eels 
under these rules  a carrier seeking to purchase an eel must certify that each circuit so purchased meets specific criteria designed to ensure that the circuit will be used to provide local exchange voice service 
we believe  and are prepared to so certify  that all of our eel circuits satisfy these criteria 
these aspects of the order were not affected by the subsequent court decision reviewing the tro or by the trro 
in the tro  the fcc also eliminated unbundling for certain incumbent local exchange carrier fiber that utilize packet technology and severely restricted unbundling for fiber loops to homes and  in a subsequent order  other predominantly residential locations such as apartment buildings 
we currently do not use any fiber to home unes 
we were  therefore  not materially affected by this ruling  although the elimination of une loops serving predominantly residential buildings could restrict our access to some small business customers 
in march  a court decision required the fcc to reconsider portions of its tro  and as a result the fcc further revised the rules in the trro adopted in late  effective march  the trro for the most part required that incumbent local exchange carriers continue to make access available to competitors for the high capacity loop and transport unes we use 
however  the new rules placed new conditions and limitations on the incumbent local exchange carriers obligation to unbundle these elements 

table of contents incumbent local exchange carriers are required to continue providing t une loops at cost based rates  except in central offices serving  or more business lines and in which four or more fiber based competitors have colocated 
because many of our customers are located in high density central business districts  some of our existing t loops are affected by this new limitation 
an incumbent local exchange carrier is also not required to provide more than t une loops to any single building  even in an area in which t loops are unbundled 
incumbent local exchange carriers are also required to continue providing both t and ds transport circuits  except on routes connecting certain high density central offices 
an incumbent local exchange carrier is not required to offer une t transport including transport as a component of a t eel between central offices that both serve at least  business lines or have four or more fiber based colocators 
for ds transport  the exemption from bundling applies if both central offices serve at least  business access lines or have three or more colocators 
again  because of the nature of the markets we serve  many of the t eels and ds transport circuits we use are affected by this exemption 
the fcc also imposed a cap of on ds transport unes and a cap of t transport unes that must be made available by an incumbent local exchange carrier on any given route  even where the high density exception does not apply 
due to certain inconsistencies between the rules and the text of the trro with regard to the application of the t transport cap  the states have applied that cap inconsistently 
various parties  including us  have petitioned the fcc to reconsider its decision on the transport cap  and these petitions are currently pending with the fcc 
on june   the dc circuit court of appeals upheld the fcc s trro in its entirety 
we expect that access to t loops serving current and new customer locations will continue to be available to us regardless of future changes in the fcc rules  although not necessarily at current prices 
all incumbent local exchange carriers are required  independent of the une rules  to offer us some form of t loop and transport services 
it is possible that the fcc may establish rates for some of these services at levels that are comparable to current une rates  or that we may be able to negotiate reasonable prices for these services through commercial negotiations with incumbent local exchange carriers 
however  we cannot assure you that either of these possibilities will occur 
if all other options were unavailable  we would be required to pay special access rates for these services 
these rates are substantially higher than the rates we pay for unes 
sbc at t and verizon mci merger proceedings 
in late  the fcc and doj approved the mergers of sbc with at t and verizon with mci 
the fcc  however  placed certain conditions on its approval of the mergers 
significantly  the fcc froze une pricing for two years and special access pricing for thirty months at current rates 
the fcc  however  further ruled that une rates under appeal at the time of the conditions are exempt from this provision if higher rates are ultimately required 
texas and illinois une rates were under appeal at the time of the fcc s order 
the illinois rates were recently affirmed by the united states court of appeals for the th circuit  but the texas rates are still under appeal 
if higher rates are ultimately ordered  the rate freeze would not apply in those states 
the fcc also required that fiber based colocator counts used to determine the availability of une loops and transport must be reduced to reflect the elimination of at t and mci as independent competitors in the sbc and verizon regions respectively 
competitive carriers filed an action in federal district court as provided for under the tunney act questioning the doj approval of the sbc at t and verizon mci mergers 
while it is unlikely that the approval of these mergers will be reversed  the matter is currently pending in the courts 
at t bellsouth merger proceeding 
in early  at t formerly sbc at t and bellsouth announced their agreement to merge  and the merger was closed on december  the doj allowed the merger to proceed without conditions  but the fcc  in granting its approval of the merger  imposed significant conditions including an agreement by at t not to use fcc forbearance procedures for a period of months  not to seek any une rate increases for the same period and to allow competitive carriers to use interconnection agreements effective in any at t state in any other at t state 
while these conditions appear positive  it will be impossible to tell whether they will have any lasting impact until we see how they are implemented and or enforced on both the state and federal level 

table of contents telric proceeding 
in late  the fcc initiated a proceeding to address the methodology used to price unes and to determine whether the current methodology total element long run incremental cost  or telric should be modified 
specifically  the fcc is evaluating whether adjustments should be made to permit incumbent local exchange carriers to recover their actual embedded costs and whether to change the time horizon used to project the forward looking costs 
this proceeding is still pending  and we cannot be certain as to either the timing or the result of the agency s action 
special access proceeding 
in january  the fcc released a notice of proposed rulemaking to initiate a comprehensive review of rules governing the pricing of special access service offered by incumbent local exchange carriers subject to price cap regulation including bellsouth  at t  qwest  verizon and some other incumbent local exchange carriers 
to the extent we are no longer able to obtain certain t loops and ds transport circuits as unes  we may choose to obtain equivalent circuits as special access  in which case our costs will be determined by the incumbent local exchange carriers special access pricing 
special access pricing by the major incumbent local exchange carriers currently is subject to price cap rules as well as pricing flexibility rules which permit these carriers to offer volume and term discounts and contract tariffs phase i pricing flexibility and remove special access service in a defined geographic area from price caps regulation phase ii pricing flexibility based on showings of competition 
the notice of proposed rulemaking tentatively concludes that the fcc should continue to permit pricing flexibility where competitive market forces are sufficient to constrain special access prices  but the fcc will undertake an examination of whether the current triggers for pricing flexibility based on certain levels of colocation by competitors within the defined geographic area accurately assess competition and have worked as intended 
the notice of proposed rulemaking also asks for comment on whether certain aspects of incumbent local exchange carrier special access tariff offerings eg basing discounts on previous volumes of service  tying nonrecurring charges and termination penalties to term commitments  and imposing use restrictions in connection with discounts  are unreasonable 
we cannot predict the impact  if any  that this proceeding will have on our cost structure 
intercarrier compensation 
in  the fcc initiated a proceeding to address rules that require one carrier to make payment to another carrier for the exchange of traffic intercarrier compensation 
in its notice of proposed rulemaking  the fcc sought comment on some possible advantages of moving from the current rules to a bill and keep structure for all traffic types in which carriers would recover costs from their own customers  not from other carriers 
in february  the fcc requested further comments on these issues and on several specific proposed plans for restructuring intercarrier compensation 
more recently  at t  bellsouth  numerous rural carriers and others offered a new proposal for reforming intercarrier compensation 
we currently have little to no revenue exposure to the exchange of local traffic since our traffic is balanced and in most cases subject to bill and keep arrangements with other local carriers 
we do  however  collect revenue for access charges for the origination and termination of other carriers long distance traffic 
if the fcc were to move to a mandatory bill and keep arrangement for this traffic or to a single cost based rate structure  at significantly lower rates than we currently charge  our revenues would be reduced 
we believe  however  that we have much less reliance on this type of revenue than many other competitive providers  because the vast majority of our revenue derives from our end user customers 
we also consider it likely that  if the fcc does adopt a bill and keep regime  it will provide some opportunity for carriers to adjust other rates to offset lost access revenues 
nevertheless  we cannot predict either the timing or the result of this fcc rulemaking 
regulatory treatment of voip 
in february  the fcc initiated a proceeding to address the appropriate regulatory framework for voip providers 
currently  the regulatory classification of most voip providers is not clear 
in the proceeding initiated in  the fcc is considering what regulation is appropriate for voip providers and whether the traffic carried by these providers will be subject to access charges 
the principal focus of this rulemaking is on whether voip providers should be subject to some or all of the regulatory obligations of common carriers 
we currently treat our services as subject to common carrier rules and regulations and  as a result  we do not anticipate that future rulings on the regulatory treatment of voip will have a material impact on us 
nevertheless  it is possible that the fcc s classification of voip services could affect our rights to obtain t loops and other unes 

table of contents as part of that proceeding  the fcc adopted new rules requiring all interconnected voip providers within days to enable all of their customers to reach designated emergency services by dialing interconnected voip providers were also required to deliver notices to their customers advising them of limitations in their emergency services and to make certain compliance filings with the fcc 
as a regulated common carrier  however  we provide traditional service over our dedicated network 
because the fcc s definition of the term interconnected voip provider is not entirely clear  the rules could be interpreted to apply to our services 
as such  we took steps to meet the notification and acknowledgement requirements to comply with fcc s order based on our interpretation of the order 
we cannot guarantee that the fcc will agree with our interpretation of its order  should it ever be addressed 
the fcc recently adopted new rules requiring that interconnected voip providers contribute to the federal universal service fund and altered the rules governing mobile wireless service providers obligations to contribute to the federal universal service fund 
as a common carrier  we already contribute to this fund 
thus  we do not interpret the new universal service requirements to impose any new requirements on us except with regard to the imposition of a new safe harbor rate for our interstate revenue associated with wireless services 
in all instances  the universal service obligations are a pass through charge  and therefore  there is little or no financial impact resulting from the changes to our wireless safe harbor rate 
the fcc has also ruled that voip providers must permit duly authorized law enforcement officials to monitor communications  and the fcc order establishing this obligation was recently upheld on appeal 
since we have already complied with these obligations  this fcc order now requires voip entrants that do not currently operate as common carriers to share some of the same burdens as us 
forbearance proceedings 
on march   a verizon petition for forbearance from title ii regulation and other requirements for broadband transmission facilities used to serve large business customers was granted by default as a matter of law due to inaction by the fcc 
thus verizon has now been relieved of common carrier obligations for these broadband transmission facilities 
while the instant relief granted does not have a direct impact on the une facilities used by us and appears not to apply to t or ds circuits  it will impact access rights to higher capacity transmission facilities in the future 
the default grant is currently subject to appeals  and there is no way to predict the outcome of these appeals 
since the default grant of the verizon petition  at t  qwest  and bellsouth have requested the same relief as that extended to verizon 
the subsequent petitions are all currently pending and all of the petitioners have requested expedited treatment 
we cannot predict the outcome of these petitions 
the relief requested should not have a direct impact on the une t  une ds or special access facilities we use but will impact our access rights to higher capacity transmission facilities in the future 
on september   verizon filed six petitions with the fcc requesting forbearance from the fcc s unbundling rules 
specifically  verizon seeks the elimination of all loop and transport unbundling requirements and of dominant carrier regulation for switched access service in pittsburgh  new york  boston  providence  virginia beach and philadelphia 
as the basis for its request  verizon relies upon a decision made in by the fcc that relieved qwest of its unbundling obligations in the omaha msa and of its dominant carrier status and obligations based on the level of cable penetration in that market 
in that proceeding  the fcc eliminated qwest s obligation to offer loop and transport unes under of the telecommunications act of the act in nine wire centers in the omaha metropolitan statistical area  or msa  in which the local cable operator has a specified level of facilities build out 
in the same proceeding  the fcc also reaffirmed qwest s obligation to continue providing those unes under of the act 
the net impact of this fcc action did not eliminate the availability of unes in omaha  but it did make them more expensive 
the qwest proceeding has no direct impact on us because we do not operate in omaha and have no plans to do so 
we are  however  concerned about the standard established by the fcc for the elimination of unes and its potential applicability to other msas 
clecs  including us  are pursuing an appeal of the order specifically with regard to the fcc s analysis used to eliminate qwest s une obligations 
the fcc granted in part a similar forbearance petition filed by acs for 
table of contents the anchorage  alaska  msa on december   but in that petition it granted more extensive protection of competitive access rights because it not only required acs to continue offering unes that would have been available under of the act  but it also set interim prices for those unes based on rates that the parties had negotiated in another market 
further  acs had asked for the right to stop offering unes in anchorage wire centers  and the fcc granted such relief with the significant caveat described above in only of the wire centers requested 
the fcc is required by statute to act on a forbearance petition within one year and can permit an additional three month extension to the one year period 
if the fcc does not explicitly vote to approve or reject verizon s pending petition  a petition such as this would be deemed to be granted as a function of law once the statutory timeframe has expired 
the relief requested by verizon would not have any immediate impact on our current or planned operations because we do not operate in the geographic areas at issue  and we have no immediate plans to do so 
however  if granted  the petitions could harm our ability to enter the affected markets in the future  if we chose to do so 
in addition and subject to significant merger related limitations operating to constrain at t forbearance activity until mid  we expect the regional bell operating companies and other incumbent lecs to file additional forbearance petitions in the future seeking elimination of unbundling requirements in other msas 
we are not aware of wire centers in any msa in which we currently offer or plan to offer service that would meet the standard for une elimination applied in the qwest and acs proceedings 
depending on the future levels of facilities based deployment in the markets at issue  however  such forbearance petitions could eventually raise the prices that we pay for t loops  eels  and other une facilities currently made available under of the act 
further  additional grants of forbearance in markets where we do not currently have facilities could cause us to adjust or modify plans for deployment in those markets 
non dominant classification proceeding 
in  the fcc initiated a proceeding to determine whether incumbent local exchange carriers should be reclassified as non dominant in provision of broadband services 
the primary impact of this reclassification would be that incumbent local exchange carriers rates would not be subject to extensive tariffing and rate regulation 
we are not currently a customer of incumbent local exchange carrier retail broadband services and  therefore  would not be affected directly by deregulation of these services at this time 
changes in these regulations could  however  increase the ability of the incumbent local exchange carriers to compete against our services 
customer proprietary network information cpni 
in early  the fcc required all carriers to certify compliance with fcc s cpni rules and requirements 
on february   the fcc initiated a proceeding seeking industry comment on what additional steps the fcc should take  if any  to further protect the privacy of cpni collected and held by telecommunications carriers 
we are unable to predict what new requirements  if any  may be placed on carriers 
we are also subject to federal and state rules and regulations pertaining to cpni 
in connection with these rules and regulations  the fcc has initiated a series of investigations regarding the cpni practices of individual companies  including ours 
the fcc s investigation of our cpni compliance began on february  on april   the fcc issued a notice of apparent liability  or nal  proposing a fine of million on us for our failure to maintain in our files a compliance certificate required by fcc rules 
the fcc s investigation is not yet complete 
the fcc may ultimately impose a fine that is larger than that proposed in the nal and may seek to impose additional fines relating to our cpni compliance 
we are currently unable to assess the magnitude and likelihood of such fines 

table of contents state regulation state agencies exercise jurisdiction over intrastate telecommunications services  including local telephone service and in state toll calls 
california  colorado  georgia  illinois and texas each have adopted statutory and regulatory schemes that require us to comply with telecommunications certification and other regulatory requirements 
to date  we are authorized to provide intrastate local telephone  long distance telephone and operator services in california  colorado  georgia  illinois and texas  as well as in nine other states where we are not yet operational 
as a condition to providing intrastate telecommunications services  we are required  among other things  to file and maintain intrastate tariffs or price lists describing the rates  terms and conditions of our services  comply with state regulatory reporting  tax and fee obligations  including contributions to intrastate universal service funds  and comply with  and to submit to  state regulatory jurisdiction over consumer protection policies including regulations governing customer privacy  changing of service providers and content of customer bills  complaints  transfers of control and certain financing transactions 
generally  state regulatory authorities can condition  modify  cancel  terminate or revoke certificates of authority to operate in a state for failure to comply with state laws or the rules  regulations and policies of the state regulatory authority 
fines and other penalties may also be imposed for such violations 
as we expand our operations  the requirements specific to any individual state will be evaluated to ensure compliance with the rules and regulations of that state 
in addition  the states have authority under the federal telecom act to determine whether we are eligible to receive funds from the federal universal service fund 
they also have authority to approve or in limited circumstances reject agreements for the interconnection of telecommunications carriers facilities with those of the incumbent local exchange carrier  to arbitrate disputes arising in negotiations for interconnection and to interpret and enforce interconnection agreements 
in exercising this authority  the states determine the rates  terms and conditions under which we can obtain access to the loop and transport unes that are required to be available under the fcc rules 
the states may re examine these rates  terms and conditions from time to time 
in illinois  we availed ourselves of certain network elements priced at une rates levels offered pursuant to illinois state rules and tariff 
these network elements are being used to replace unes that are no longer available subject to the trro non impairment analysis 
these network elements are also subject to a pending appeal filed by at t which questions the state commission authority to require these network elements under state law 
if at t is successful in its appeal  it is possible that we would be subject to higher rates for the network elements it orders under the applicable state tariff 
state commissions are in the process of implementing the tro and trro by conducting proceedings to interpret the tro trro requirements for purposes of amending the interconnection agreements as required by the trro 
many of these proceedings have concluded for the most part  however  various sub issues remain under review and decisions are still subject to petitions for reconsideration and appeals in many cases 
as such  the orders are not final and changes could occur that would impact the rulings of the state commissions 
as a part of the trro implementation proceedings  many states are also requiring incumbent local exchange carriers to provide access to the network elements required under section and in some cases are conducting investigations to provide pricing of network elements 
state rulings on our rights to access network elements and the pricing of elements will also be subject to appeals and possibly fcc intervention 
california  georgia  illinois and texas have addressed access rights in the context of the trro proceedings  but only georgia has set rates for network elements 
bellsouth has appealed the georgia decision  and the fcc also has an open proceeding that is addressing state authority regarding thus far  the us district courts that have considered the issue of state authority to set network element rates have reached conflicting conclusions  and no decisions by us courts of appeal have yet been issued through several such appeals are pending 
the us district courts that have reviewed the matter have not  however  been in any state where 
table of contents we have business operations 
it is impossible to predict how the georgia court will rule 
a negative opinion by the district court in georgia could result in rate increases for the network elements that we purchase from bellsouth 
state governments and their regulatory authorities may also assert jurisdiction over the provision of intrastate ip communications services where they believe that their authority is broad enough to cover regulation of ip based services 
various state regulatory authorities have initiated proceedings to examine the regulatory status of ip telephony services 
we operate as a regulated carrier subject to state regulation  rules and fees and  therefore  do not expect to be affected by these proceedings 
the fcc proceeding on voip is expected to address  among other issues  the appropriate role of state governments in the regulation of these services 
local regulation in certain locations  we are required to obtain local franchises  licenses or other operating rights and street opening and construction permits to install  expand and operate our telecommunications facilities in the public rights of way 
in some of the areas where we provide services  we pay license or franchise fees based on a percentage of gross revenues 
cities that do not currently impose fees might seek to impose them in the future  and after the expiration of existing franchises  fees could increase 
under the federal telecom act  state and local governments retain the right to manage the public rights of way and to require fair and reasonable compensation from telecommunications providers  on a competitively neutral and non discriminatory basis  to recover the costs associated with government s management of the public rights of way 
as noted above  these activities must be consistent with the federal telecom act and may not have the effect of prohibiting us from providing telecommunications services in any particular local jurisdiction 
in certain circumstances  we may be subject to local fees associated with construction and operation of telecommunications facilities in the public rights of way 
to the extent these fees are required  we comply with requirements to collect and remit the fees

table of contents item a 
risk factors risk related to our business we have not been profitable on a consistent basis and we may not continue to be profitable in the future 
we have experienced significant losses in the past 
for the years ended december  and  we recorded net losses of approximately million and million excluding the gain of million from the payoff of our debt 
although we are net income positive for the year ended december   this does not guarantee positive income in the future 
we have only recently experienced sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our expenses and may not continue to do so as we launch new markets or products 
we have not been profitable on a consistent basis  and we may not continue to be profitable in the future 
we face intense competition from other providers of communications services that have significantly greater resources than we do 
several of these competitors are better positioned to engage in competitive pricing  which may impede our ability to implement our business model of attracting customers away from such providers 
the market for communications services is highly competitive 
we compete  and expect to continue to compete  with many types of communications providers  including traditional local telephone companies 
in the future  we may also face increased competition from cable companies  new voip based service providers or other managed service providers with similar business models to our own 
we integrated mobile services with our existing services in the first quarter of and now face competition from mobile service providers as well 
our current or future competitors may provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us  or at lower prices  or adapt more quickly to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
a substantial majority of our target customers are existing small businesses that are already purchasing communications services from one or more of these providers 
the success of our operations is dependent on our ability to persuade these small businesses to leave their current providers 
many of these providers have competitive advantages over us  including substantially greater financial  personnel and other resources  better access to capital  brand name recognition and long standing relationships with customers 
these resources may place us at a competitive disadvantage in our current markets and limit our ability to expand into new markets 
because of their greater financial resources  some of our competitors can also better afford to reduce prices for their services and engage in aggressive promotional activities 
such tactics could have a negative impact on our business 
for example  some of our competitors have adopted pricing plans such that the rates that they charge are not always substantially higher  and in some cases are lower  than the rates that we charge for similar services 
in addition  other providers are offering unlimited or nearly unlimited use of some of their services for an attractive monthly rate 
any of the foregoing factors could require us to reduce our prices to remain competitive or cause us to lose customers  resulting in a decrease in our arpu and revenue 
increasing use of voip technology by our competitors  entry into the market by new providers employing voip technology and improvements in quality of service of voip technology provided over the public internet could increase competition 
our success is based partly on our ability to provide voice and broadband services at a price that customers typically pay for voice services alone by taking advantage of cost savings achieved by employing voip technology  as compared to using traditional networks 
the adoption of voip technology by other communications carriers  including existing competitors such as local telephone companies that currently use legacy technologies  could increase price competition 
moreover  other voip providers could also enter the market 
because networks using voip technology can be deployed with less capital investment than traditional networks  there are lower barriers to entry in this market  and it may be easier for new entrants to emerge 
increased competition may require us to lower our prices or may make it more difficult for us to retain our existing customers or add new customers 

table of contents we believe we generally do not compete with voip providers who use the public internet to transmit communications traffic  as these providers generally do not provide the level and quality of service typically demanded by the business customers we serve 
however  future advances in voip technology may enable these providers to offer an improved level and quality of service to business customers over the public internet and with lower costs than using a private network 
this development could result in increased price competition 
the success of our expansion plans depends on a number of factors that are beyond our control 
we have grown our business by entering new geographical markets  and we plan to expand into at least five additional markets by the end of  including three new markets by the end of  of which san diego was launched in january we have never undertaken such a broad expansion plan  and there can be no guarantee that our expansion plans will be successful 
our success in expanding to new markets depends on the following factors the availability and retention of qualified and effective local management  the overall economic health of the new markets  the number and effectiveness of competitors  the pricing structure under which we will be able to obtain circuits and purchase other services required to serve our customers  our ability to establish a relationship and work effectively with the local telephone company for the provision of access lines to customers  and the maintenance of state regulation that protects us from unfair business practices by local telephone companies or others with greater market power who have relationships with us as both competitors and suppliers 
our operational support systems and business processes may not be adequate to effectively manage our growth 
our continued success depends on the scalability of our systems and processes 
as of december   none of our individual market operations have supported levels of customers substantially in excess of  and our centralized systems and processes have not supported more than approximately  customer locations 
we cannot be certain that our systems and processes are adequate to support ongoing growth in customers 
in addition  our growing managed services profile  including our new mobile services and associated new applications  may create operating inefficiencies and result in service problems if we are unsuccessful in fully integrating such new services into our existing operations 
failure to manage our future growth effectively could harm our quality of service and customer relationships  which could increase our customer churn  result in higher operating costs  write offs or other accounting charges and otherwise materially harm our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to continue to grow our customer base at historic rates  which would result in a decrease in the rate of revenue growth 
from december  to december   we experienced an annual growth rate in customer locations of 
we may not experience this same growth rate in the future  or we may not grow at all  in our current markets 
future growth in our existing markets may be more difficult than our growth has been to date due to increased or more effective competition in the future  difficulties in scaling our business systems and processes or difficulty in maintaining sufficient numbers of qualified market management personnel  sales personnel and qualified integrated access device installation service providers to obtain and support additional customers 
failure to continue to grow our customer base at historic rates would result in a corresponding decrease in the rate of our revenue growth 

table of contents we depend on third party providers who install our integrated access devices at customer locations 
we must maintain relationships with efficient installation service providers in our current cities and identify similar providers as we enter new markets in order to maintain quality in our operations 
the installation of integrated access devices at customer locations is an essential step that enables our customers to obtain our service 
we outsource the installation of integrated access devices to a number of different installation vendors in each market 
we must ensure that these vendors adhere to the timelines and quality that we require to provide our customers with a positive installation experience 
in addition  we must obtain these installation services at reasonable prices 
if we are unable to continue maintaining a sufficient number of installation vendors in our markets who provide high quality service at reasonable prices to us  we may have to use our own employees to perform installations of integrated access devices 
we may not be able to manage such installations effectively using our own employees with the quality we desire and at reasonable costs 
we depend on local telephone companies for the installation and maintenance of our customers t access lines and other network elements and facilities 
our customers t access lines are installed and maintained by local telephone companies in each of our markets 
if the local telephone company does not perform the installation properly or in a timely manner  our customers could experience disruption in service and delays in obtaining our services 
since inception  we have experienced routine delays in the installation of t lines by the local telephone companies to our customers in each of our markets  although these delays have not yet resulted in any material impact to our ability to compete and add customers in our markets 
any work stoppage action by employees of a local telephone company that provides us services in one of our markets could result in substantial delays in activating new customers lines and could materially harm our operations 
although local telephone companies may be required to pay fines and penalties to us for failures to provide us with these installation and maintenance services according to prescribed time intervals  the negative impact on our business of such failures could substantially exceed the amount of any such cash payments 
furthermore  we are also dependent on traditional local telephone companies for access to their colocation facilities  and we utilize certain of their network elements 
failure of these elements or damage to a local telephone company s colocation facility would cause disruptions in our service 
some of our services are dependent on facilities and systems maintained by third parties over which we have no control  the failure of which could cause interruptions or discontinuation of some of our services  damage our reputation  cause us to lose customers and limit our growth 
we provide some of our existing services  such as email and web hosting  by reselling to our customers services provided by third parties  and beginning in the first quarter of  we started offering mobile options integrated with our existing services by reselling mobile services provided by an established national third party mobile carrier 
we do not have control over the networks and other systems maintained by these third parties 
if our third party providers fail to maintain their facilities properly or fail to respond quickly to network or other problems  our customers may experience interruptions in the service they obtain from us 
any service interruptions experienced by our customers could negatively impact our reputation  cause us to lose customers and limit our ability to attract new customers 
if we cannot negotiate new or extensions of existing interconnection agreements with local telephone companies on acceptable terms  it will be more difficult and costly for us to provide service to our existing customers and to expand our business 
we have agreements for the interconnection of our network with the networks of the local telephone companies covering each market in which we operate 
these agreements also provide the framework for service to our customers when other local carriers are involved 
we will be required to negotiate new interconnection agreements to enter new markets in the future 
in addition  we will need to negotiate extension or replacement agreements as our existing interconnection agreements expire 
most of our interconnection agreements 
table of contents have terms of three years  although the parties may mutually decide to amend the terms of such agreements 
if we cannot negotiate new interconnection agreements or renew our existing interconnection agreements on favorable terms or at all  we may invoke binding arbitration by state regulatory agencies 
the arbitration process is expensive and time consuming  and the results of an arbitration may be unfavorable to us 
if we are unable to obtain favorable interconnection terms  it would harm our existing operations and opportunities to grow our business in our current and new markets 
the fixed pricing structure for our integrated packages makes us vulnerable to price increases by our suppliers for network equipment and access fees for circuits that we lease to gain access to our customers 
we offer our integrated packages to customers at a fixed price for one  two or three years 
if we experience an increase in our costs due to price increases from our suppliers  vendors or third party carriers or increases in access  installation  interconnection fees payable to local telephone companies or other fees  we may not be able to pass these increases on to our customers immediately  and this could materially harm our results of operations 
we are regulated by the federal communications commission  state public service commissions and local regulating governmental bodies 
changes in regulation could result in price increases on the circuits that we lease from the local telephone companies or losing our right to lease these circuits from them 
we operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to regulation by telecommunications authorities at the federal  state and local levels 
changes in regulatory policy could increase the fees we must pay to third parties  make certain required inputs for our network less readily available to us or subject us to more stringent requirements that could cause us to incur additional operating expenditures 
the t connections we provide to our customers are leased primarily from our competitors  the local telephone companies 
the rules of the federal communication commission  or the fcc  adopted under the telecommunications act of generally entitle us to lease these connections at wholesale prices based on incremental costs 
it is possible  though we believe unlikely  that congress will pass legislation in the future that will diminish or eliminate our right to lease such connections at regulated rates 
in addition  a court decision in late led the fcc to eliminate our right to purchase connections at wholesale prices based on incremental costs in some situations 
therefore  the costs we incur to obtain some of these t connections have increased 
our rights of access to the facilities of local telephone companies may also change as a result of future regulatory decisions  including forbearance petitions as well as court decisions 
although we expect that we will continue to be able to obtain t connections for our customers  we may not be able to do so at current prices 
the pricing for the majority of the t connections we use is established by state regulatory commissions and  from time to time  this pricing is reviewed and the state commission decisions are subject to appeal 
if our right to obtain these connections at regulated prices based on incremental costs is further impaired  we will need either to negotiate new commercial arrangements with the local telephone companies to obtain the connections  perhaps at unfavorable rates and conditions  or to obtain other means of providing connections to our customers  which may be expensive and require a long timeframe to implement 
the fcc is also considering changing its rules for calculating incremental cost based rates  which could result in either increases or decreases in our cost to lease these facilities 
significant increases in wholesale prices  especially for the loop element we use most extensively  could materially harm our business 
the fcc is reexamining its policies towards voip and telecommunications in general 
new or existing regulation could subject us to additional fees or increase the competition we face 
we currently operate as a regulated common carrier  which subjects us to some regulatory obligations 
the fcc adopted rules applicable to interconnected voip providers  but it has not determined whether to classify interconnected voip providers as common carriers 
the rules applicable to interconnected voip providers require them to provide access to emergency services for all customers that are comparable to the services provided by traditional telephone networks  to implement certain capabilities for the monitoring 
table of contents of communications by law enforcement agencies pursuant to a subpoena or court order and to contribute to the federal universal service fund 
as a common carrier  we currently comply with the requirements  comply with the law enforcement assistance requirements applicable to traditional telecommunications carriers and contribute to the federal universal service fund 
the fcc continues to examine its policies towards services provided over ip networks  such as our voip technology  and the results of these proceedings could impose additional obligations  fees or limitations on us 
we are also subject to federal and state rules and regulations pertaining to customer proprietary network information  or cpni 
in connection with these rules and regulations  the fcc has initiated a series of investigations regarding the cpni practices of individual companies  including ours 
the fcc s investigation of our cpni compliance began on february  on april   the fcc issued a notice of apparent liability  or nal  proposing a fine of million on us for our failure to maintain in our files a compliance certificate required by fcc rules 
the fcc s investigation is not yet complete 
the fcc may ultimately impose a fine that is larger than that proposed in the nal and may seek to impose additional fines relating to our cpni compliance 
we are currently unable to assess the magnitude and likelihood of such fines 
regulatory decisions may also affect the level of competition we face 
reduced regulation of retail services offered by local telephone companies could increase the competitive advantages those companies enjoy  cause us to lower our prices in order to remain competitive or otherwise make it more difficult for us to attract and retain customers 
our network depends on new ip technology that has not been widely deployed 
as a result  the adaptability and reliability of this technology remains uncertain 
in contrast to the legacy circuit switch technology used by the traditional telephone companies and other providers of traditional communications services  our network is based on ip technology 
this technology is much newer and has not been used on active networks for as long 
although we believe that ip technology is well designed for the provision of a broad array of communications services to high numbers of users  we cannot assure you that our ip based network can adapt to future technological advancements  that it can handle increasingly higher volumes of voice and data traffic as we grow our business or as our customers usage increases  or that it will be reliable over long periods of time 
any failure of our network or any deterioration in our quality of service compared to those of other providers of communications services could cause an increase in our customer churn rate and make it difficult for us to acquire new customers 
our competitors may be better positioned than we are to adapt to rapid changes in technology  and we could lose customers 
the communications industry has experienced  and will probably continue to experience  rapid and significant changes in technology 
technological changes  such as the use of wireless network access to customers in place of the t access lines we lease from the local telephone companies  could render aspects of the technology we employ suboptimal or obsolete and provide a competitive advantage to new or larger competitors who might more easily be able to take advantage of these opportunities 
some of our competitors  including the local telephone companies  have a much longer operating history  more experience in making upgrades to their networks and greater financial resources than we do 
we cannot assure you that we will obtain access to new technologies as quickly or on the same terms as our competitors  or that we will be able to apply new technologies to our existing networks without incurring significant costs or at all 
in addition  responding to demand for new technologies would require us to increase our capital expenditures  which may require additional financing in order to fund 
as a result of those factors  we would lose customers and our financial results could be harmed 
continued industry consolidation could further strengthen our competitors  and we could lose customers or face adverse changes in regulation 
in  verizon announced its merger with mci  and sbc announced its merger with at t  with the combined company being renamed at t 
in late  at t and bellsouth completed the merger of their two 
table of contents companies 
while we believe that  at least in the short term  this increasing consolidation in the communications industry will result in a greater focus on the part of our competitors on the large enterprise and consumer markets  the increased size and market power of these companies may have adverse consequences for us 
these competitors could focus their large resources  in the future  on regaining share in the small business sector  and we could lose customers or not grow as rapidly 
furthermore  these companies could use their greater resources to lobby effectively for changes in federal or state regulation that could have an adverse effect on our cost structure or our right to use access circuits that they are currently required to make available to us 
these changes would have a harmful effect on our future financial results 
we have had material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in the past and cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future 
our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements which could require us to restate financial statements  cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on our stock price 
during and  management and our independent registered public accounting firm identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting  as defined in the standards established by the american institute of certified public accountants  that affected our financial statements for each of the years in the four year period ended december  we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future 
any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls  or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation  could result in additional material weaknesses  cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements 
any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under section of the sarbanes oxley act of the existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements  cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information  leading to a decline in our stock price 
system disruptions could cause delays or interruptions of our service  which could cause us to lose customers or incur additional expenses 
our success depends on our ability to provide reliable service 
although we have designed our network service to minimize the possibility of service disruptions or other outages  our service may be disrupted by problems on our system  such as malfunctions in our software or other facilities  overloading of our network and problems with the systems of competitors with which we interconnect  such as physical damage to telephone lines and power surges and outages 
although we have experienced isolated power disruptions and other outages for short time periods  we have not had any system disruptions of a sufficient duration or magnitude that would have a significant impact to our customers or our business 
any significant disruption in our network could cause us to lose customers and incur additional expenses 
business disruptions  including disruptions caused by security breaches  terrorism or other disasters  could harm our future operating results 
the day to day operation of our business is highly dependent on the integrity of our communications and information technology systems  and on our ability to protect those systems from damage or interruptions by events beyond our control 
sabotage  computer viruses or other infiltration by third parties could damage our systems 
such events could disrupt our service  damage our facilities  damage our reputation  and cause us to lose customers  among other things  and could harm our results of operations 
in addition  a catastrophic event could materially harm our operating results and financial condition 
catastrophic events could include a terrorist attack on the united states  or a major earthquake  fire  or similar event that affects our central offices  corporate 
table of contents headquarters  network operations center or network equipment 
we believe that communications infrastructures  such as the one on which we rely  may be vulnerable in the case of such an event  and our markets  which are metropolitan markets  or tier markets  may be more likely to be the targets of terrorist activity 
our customer churn rate may increase 
although our customer churn rate was approximately per month for  and  we cannot assure that we will be able to maintain this rate in the future 
customer churn occurs when a customer switches to one of our competitors or when a customer discontinues its business altogether 
changes in the economy  as well as increased competition from other providers  can both impact our customer churn rate 
we cannot predict future pricing by our competitors  but we anticipate that aggressive price competition will continue 
lower prices offered by our competitors could contribute to an increase in customer churn 
in addition  our historical customer churn rates may not be indicative of future rates because the initial term for many of our customer contracts based on customer location has not yet expired 
as of december   approximately of our existing customer contracts will expire in and approximately of our customers are on month to month contracts  which take effect automatically upon the expiration of our three year contracts unless otherwise extended 
we obtain the majority of our network equipment and software from cisco systems  inc our success depends upon the quality  availability and price of cisco s network equipment and software 
we obtain the majority of our network equipment and software from cisco systems  inc  or cisco systems 
in addition  we rely on cisco systems for technical support and assistance 
although we believe that we maintain a good relationship with cisco systems and our other suppliers  if cisco systems or any of our other suppliers were to terminate our relationship or were to cease making the equipment and software we use  our ability to maintain  upgrade or expand our network could be impaired 
although we believe that we would be able to address our future equipment needs with equipment obtained from other suppliers  we cannot assure you that such equipment would be compatible with our network without significant modifications or cost  if at all 
if we were unable to obtain the equipment necessary to maintain our network  our ability to attract and retain customers and provide our services would be impaired 
in addition  our success depends on our obtaining network equipment and software at affordable prices 
significant increases in the price of these products would harm our financial results and may increase our capital requirements 
we depend on third party vendors for information systems 
if these vendors discontinue support for the systems we use or fail to maintain quality in future software releases  we could sustain a negative impact on the quality of our services to customers  the development of new services and features and the quality of information needed to manage our business 
we have entered into agreements with vendors that provide for the development and operation of back office systems  such as ordering  provisioning and billing systems 
we also rely on vendors to provide the systems for monitoring the performance and condition of our network 
the failure of those vendors to perform their services in a timely and effective manner at acceptable costs could materially harm our growth and our ability to monitor costs  bill customers  provision customer orders  maintain the network and achieve operating efficiencies 
such a failure could also negatively impact our ability to retain existing customers or to attract new customers 
if we are unable to generate the cash that we need to pursue our business plan  we may have to raise additional capital on terms unfavorable to our stockholders 
the actual amount of capital required to fund our operations and development may vary materially from our estimates 
if our operations fail to generate the cash that we expect  we may have to seek additional capital to fund our business 
if we are required to obtain additional funding in the future  we may have to sell assets  seek debt financing or obtain additional equity capital 
in addition  the terms of our secured revolving line of credit 
table of contents with bank of america subjects us to restrictive covenants limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business  and any other indebtedness we incur in the future is likely to include similar covenants 
if we do not comply with such covenants  our lenders could accelerate repayment of our debt or restrict our access to further borrowings 
if we raise funds by selling more stock  our stockholders ownership in us will be diluted  and we may grant future investors rights superior to those of the common stockholders 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital when needed  we may have to delay  modify or abandon some of our expansion plans 
this could slow our growth  negatively affect our ability to compete in our industry and adversely affect our financial condition 
risks related to our common stock future sales of shares by existing stockholders or issuances of our common stock by us could reduce our stock price 
if our existing stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or we issue additional shares of common stock  par value per share  the market price of our common stock could decline 
we may also issue shares of our common stock from time to time as consideration for future acquisitions and investments 
if any such acquisition or investment is significant  the number of shares that we issue may in turn by significant 
in addition  we may grant registration rights covering those shares in connection with any such acquisitions and investments 
in the future  we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital 
we cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect  if any  that they may have on the market price of our common stock 
the issuance and sales of substantial amounts of common stock  or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur  could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware corporate law might deter acquisition bids for us that our stockholders might consider favorable 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides for a classified board of directors  the inability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders  to act by written consent  to remove any director or the entire board of directors without cause  or to fill any vacancy on the board of directors  and advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals 
our board of directors is also permitted to authorize the issuance of preferred stock with rights superior to the rights of the holders of common stock without any vote or further action by our stockholders 
these provisions and other provisions under delaware law could make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  even if doing so would benefit our stockholders 
because we do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock  stockholders will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value 
the continued expansion of our business will require substantial funding 
accordingly  we do not currently anticipate paying any dividends on shares of our common stock 
any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations  financial condition  contractual restrictions  restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant 
accordingly  realization of a gain on stockholders investments will depend on the appreciation of the price of our common stock 
there is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which stockholders purchased their shares

our chief executive officer  who is our chief operating decision maker  also uses our segment adjusted ebitda to evaluate the performance of our reportable segments in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
ebitda represents net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  excluding  when applicable  non cash share based compensation  public offering expenses  gain recognized on troubled debt restructuring  gain from write off of carrying value in excess of principal  loss on disposal of property and equipment and other non operating income or expense 
our total adjusted ebitda represents the sum of adjusted ebitda for each of our segments 
our total adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure 
our management uses total adjusted ebitda in its decision making processes relating to the operation of our business together with gaap measures such as revenue and income from operations 
our calculation of total adjusted ebitda excludes  when applicable the gains related to our troubled debt restructuring in  public offering expenses incurred and the gain from the early payoff of our restructured debt in  and non cash share based compensation  loss on disposal of property and equipment and other non operating income or expense  each of which our management views as non operating and non cash expenses that are not related to management s assessment of the operating results and performance of our segments or our consolidated operations 
our management believes that total adjusted ebitda permits a comparative assessment of our operating performance  relative to our performance based on our gaap results  while isolating the effects of depreciation 
table of contents and amortization  which may vary from period to period without any correlation to underlying operating performance  and of non cash share based compensation  which is a non cash expense that varies widely among similar companies 
we provide information relating to our total adjusted ebitda so that investors have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations 
we believe that trends in our total adjusted ebitda are a valuable indicator of the operating performance of our company on a consolidated basis and of our operating segments ability to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
in addition  total adjusted ebitda is a useful comparative measure within the communications industry because the industry has experienced recent trends of increased merger and acquisition activity and financial restructurings  which have led to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital which affect interest expense and differences in taxation and book depreciation of facilities and equipment which affect relative depreciation expense  including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies  as well as non operating or infrequent charges to earnings  such as the effect of debt restructurings 
accordingly  total adjusted ebitda allows analysts  investors and other interested parties in the communications industry to facilitate company to company comparisons by eliminating some of the foregoing variations 
total adjusted ebitda as used in this report may not  however  be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies and items excluded or included in the adjustments  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
our calculation of total adjusted ebitda is not directly comparable to ebit earnings before interest and taxes or ebitda 
in addition  total adjusted ebitda does not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  our interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our debts  and any cash requirements for the replacement of assets being depreciated and amortized  which will often have to be replaced in the future  even though depreciation and amortization are non cash charges 
total adjusted ebitda is not intended to replace operating income  net income loss and other measures of financial performance reported in accordance with gaap 
rather  total adjusted ebitda is a measure of operating performance that you may consider in addition to those measures 
because of these limitations  total adjusted ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using total adjusted ebitda as a supplemental financial measure 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion together with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included elsewhere in this report 
the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
overview we provide managed ip based communications services to our target customers of small businesses with to employees in selected large metropolitan areas 
we provide these services through bundled packages of local and long distance voice services  broadband internet services and mobile services  together with additional applications and services  for an affordable fixed monthly fee under contracts with terms of one  two or three years 
we currently operate in atlanta  dallas  denver  houston  chicago and los angeles  and  in january  we began providing service in san diego 
we sell three basic bundled packages of services  primarily delineated by the number of local voice lines  long distance minutes and t connections provided to the customer 
each of our beyondvoice packages includes local and long distance voice services and broadband internet access  plus additional value added applications 
customers may also choose to add extra features or lines for an additional fee 
beginning in the first quarter of  we started offering mobile services  which are integrated with our existing services 
our voice services other than our mobile voice services are delivered using voip technology  and all of such services are delivered over our secure all ip network  which we believe affords greater service flexibility and significantly lower network costs than traditional service providers using circuit switch technologies 
we offer our mobile voice and data services via our mobile virtual network operator relationship with a nationwide wireless network provider 
we believe our high degree of systems automation contributes to operational efficiencies and lower costs in our support functions 
we sell our services primarily through a direct sales force in each market  supplemented by sales agents 
these agents often have other business relationships with the customer and  in many cases  perform equipment installations for us at our customers sites 
a significant portion of our new customers is generated by referrals from existing customers and partners 
we offer financial incentives to our customers and other sources for referrals 
we compete primarily against incumbent local exchange carriers and  to a lesser extent  against competitive local exchange carriers  both of which are local telephone companies 
local telephone companies do not generally have the same focus on our target market and principally concentrate on medium or large enterprises or residential customers 
we compete primarily based on our high value bundled services that bring many of the same managed services to our customers that have historically been available only to large businesses  as well as based on our customer care  network reliability and operational efficiencies 
we formed cbeyond and began the development of our network and business processes following our first significant funding in early we launched our service first in atlanta in april  followed by dallas in october and denver in january during the remainder of and  we focused on building our customer bases in these markets 
as a result of our progress  we decided to launch our service in additional markets 
we launched our service in houston in march  chicago in march  los angeles in march and  subsequently  san diego in january we plan to expand into at least five additional markets by the end of  including three new markets by the end of  san diego being one of these new markets in 
table of contents we focus on adjusted ebitda as a principal indicator of the operating performance of our business 
ebitda represents net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
we define adjusted ebitda as net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization expenses  excluding  when applicable  non cash share based compensation  public offering expenses  gains related to our troubled debt restructuring and our early payoff of the restructured debt  gain or loss on disposal of property and equipment and other non operating income or expense 
in our presentation of segment financial results  adjusted ebitda for a segment does not include corporate overhead expense and other centralized operating costs 
we believe that adjusted ebitda trends are a valuable indicator of our operating segments relative performance and of whether our operating segments are able to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
we seek to achieve positive adjusted ebitda  excluding corporate overhead  in our new markets approximately months from launch 
we first achieved positive adjusted ebitda in atlanta  dallas  denver  houston and chicago within the targeted timeframe 
whether we achieve positive adjusted ebitda in new markets within the same timeframe depends on a number of factors  including the local pricing environment  the competitive landscape and our costs to obtain unbundled network elements  or unes  from the local telephone company in each market  including elements such as loops  dedicated transport  local voice termination and operational support systems 
as of december   we divided our business into six operating segments atlanta  dallas  denver  houston  chicago and los angeles  our corporate segment and san diego  which  although not yet launched  has incurred certain expenses in preparation for starting operations in january we believe our business approach requires significantly less capital to launch operations compared to traditional communications companies using legacy technologies 
most of our capital expenditures related to expanding into new markets are success based  incurred only as our customer base grows 
based on our historical experience  over time  a substantial majority of our market specific capital expenditures are success based 
we believe the success based nature of our capital expenditures mitigates the risk of unprofitable expansion 
we have a relatively low fixed cost component in our budgeted capital expenditures associated with each new market we enter  particularly in comparison to service providers employing time division multiplexing  which is a technique for transmitting multiple channels of separate data  voice and or video signals simultaneously over a single communication medium  or circuit switch technology  which is a switch that establishes a dedicated circuit for the entire duration of a call 
revenue the majority of our customers subscribe to our beyondvoice i package  which serves customers with local voice lines  or generally or fewer employees 
we also sell subscriptions of beyondvoice ii to customers with local voice lines  or generally employees 
our beyondvoice iii package is typically offered to customers with employees 
each beyondvoice i customer receives all our services over a dedicated broadband t connection providing a maximum symmetric bandwidth of mbps megabits per second 
beyondvoice ii customers receive their services over two dedicated t connections offering a maximum symmetric bandwidth of mbps 
beyondvoice iii customers receive their services over three dedicated t connections offering a maximum symmetric bandwidth of mbps 
we believe that our customers highly value the level of symmetric bandwidth offered with our services 
as of december   approximately of our customer base has beyondvoice i  has beyondvoice ii  and have beyondvoice iii 
average monthly revenue per customer location decreased from per customer location in to per customer location in  due to increased levels of customers under three year contracts at lower price points  competitive pricing pressure on new contracts and contract renewals resulting in a higher level of promotions offered to customers and terminating access rate reductions as mandated by the fcc 
average monthly revenue per customer location decreased to for the year ended december  due to a number of factors  including an increasing trend toward three year contracts which are at lower price points  decreases in the government mandated rates we charge for terminating access revenues  and customer contract renewals at 
table of contents lower price points  offset by the positive impact of increasing levels of application use per customer  in particular mobile services 
customer revenues represented approximately  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
revenues from access charges paid to us by other communications companies to terminate calls to our customers represented approximately  and of revenues in  and  respectively 
expenses cost of service 
our cost of service represents costs directly related to the operation of our network  including payments to the local telephone companies and other communications carriers  such as long distance providers and our mobile provider  for access  interconnection and transport fees for voice and internet traffic  customer circuit installation expenses paid to the local telephone companies  fees paid to third party providers of certain applications such as web hosting services  colocation rents and other facility costs  and telecommunications related taxes and fees  and  beginning in  the costs of mobile handsets 
the primary component of cost of service is the access fees paid to local telephone companies for the t circuits we lease on a monthly basis to provide connectivity to our customers 
these access circuits link our customers to our network equipment located in a colocation facility  which we lease from local telephone companies 
the access fees for these circuits vary by state and are the primary reason for differences in cost of service across our markets 
although our mobile services do not currently constitute a principal component of our cost of service  we expect that as our mobile services increase over time  they will represent a larger component of our cost of service 
as a result of the triennial review remand order  or trro  we are required to lease circuits under special access  or retail  rates in locations that are deemed to offer competitive facilities as outlined in the fcc s regulations and interpreted by the state regulatory agencies 
for additional discussion  see results of operations revenue and cost of service 
where permitted by regulation  we lease our access circuits on a wholesale basis as unbundled network element  or une  loops or extended enhanced links as provided for under the fcc s telecommunications elemental long run incremental cost rate structure 
we employ une loops when the customer s t circuit is located where it can be connected to a local telephone company s central office where we have a colocation  and we use extended enhanced links when we do not have a central office colocation available to serve a customer s t circuit 
historically  approximately half of our circuits are provisioned using une loops and half using extended enhanced links  although the impact of the trro has reduced our usage of the t transport portion of extended enhanced links and resulted in the conversion of a majority of the previously installed t transport to ds transport 
our monthly expenses are significantly less when using une loops than extended enhanced links  but une loops require us to incur the capital expenditures of central office colocation equipment 
both une loops and extended enhanced loops offer significant cost advantages over special access based circuits 
we install central office colocation equipment in those central offices having the densest concentration of small businesses 
we usually launch operations in a new market with several colocations and add additional colocation facilities over time as we confirm the most advantageous locations in which to deploy the equipment 
we believe our discipline of leasing these t access circuits on a wholesale basis rather than on the basis of special access rates from the local telephone companies is an important component of our operating cost structure 
we receive service credits from various local telephone companies to adjust for prior errors in billing  including the effect of price decreases retroactively applied upon the adoption of new rates as mandated by regulatory bodies 
these service credits are often the result of negotiated resolutions of bill disputes that we conduct with our vendors 
we also receive payments from the local telephone companies in the form of performance penalties that are assessed by state regulatory commissions based on the local telephone companies performance in the delivery of circuits and other services that we use in our network 
because of the many factors  as noted  that impact the amount and timing of service credits and performance penalties  estimating the ultimate outcome of these situations is uncertain 
accordingly  we recognize service credits and performance 
table of contents penalties as offsets to cost of service when the ultimate resolution and amount are known 
these items do not follow any predictable trends and often result in variances when comparing the amounts received over multiple periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for employees and other expenses related to sales and marketing  engineering  information technology  billing  regulatory  administrative  collections and legal and accounting functions 
our selling  general and administrative expenses include both fixed and variable costs 
fixed selling expenses include salaries and office rents 
variable selling costs include commissions and marketing collateral 
fixed general and administrative costs include the cost of staffing certain corporate overhead functions  such as it  marketing  administrative  billing and engineering  and associated costs  such as office rent  legal and accounting fees  property taxes and recruiting costs 
variable general and administrative costs include the cost of provisioning and customer activation staff  which grows with the level of installation of new customers  and the cost of customer care and technical support staff  which grows with the level of total customers on our network 
as we expand into new markets  certain fixed costs are likely to increase  however  these increases are intermittent and not proportional with the growth of customers 
public offering expenses 
in  we began work in connection with an initial public offering of our common stock 
in connection with the proposed offering  we incurred direct expenses  which were primarily legal and accounting fees with outside service firms  of million 
we have expensed these costs 
in  we deducted the actual costs of our initial public offering from the proceeds of the offering as a charge against additional paid in capital because the costs were incurred in connection with the transaction 
in october  we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of common stock  including  shares that were issued by us in connection with option exercises executed at the time of the offering 
all offered shares were from existing stockholders with no proceeds to us 
we expensed all direct costs of this offering  which were primarily legal and accounting fees with outside service firms related to the preparation of the registration statement  which totaled million 
depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation is applied using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets once the assets are placed in service 
we generally depreciate network related equipment  software and it equipment  which represents the majority of our assets  over two to seven years 
we depreciate furniture over seven years 
the value of leasehold improvements is generally amortized over three to ten years  which is the shorter of the respective lease term or duration of economic benefit of the assets 
interest expense net 
interest expense net consists of interest charges paid on our long term debt through our credit facility with cisco capital  interest charges recognized under capital lease obligations incurred in connection with certain software licenses  commitment fees under our bank of america line of credit  interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  long term investments  restricted cash equivalents  and non cash income recognized through the amortization of a portion of the gain recorded in connection with the restructuring of our debt in november in november  we repaid the full balance of our debt with cisco capital and the credit facility was terminated 
gain recognized on troubled debt restructuring 
the gain recognized in connection with the conversion of our debt with cisco capital into series b preferred stock in november was recorded as troubled debt restructuring under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by debtors and creditors for troubled debt restructurings 
a portion of the gain was recognized at the time of the transaction 
however  the total amount of the gain could not then be recorded 
therefore  the remaining carrying value in excess of principal at the restructuring was included in the balance of long term debt 
this carrying value in excess of principal was reduced on an ongoing basis as interest payments were made until the expiration or prepayment of the debt 
the reduction partially offsets interest expense 

table of contents gain from write off of carrying value in excess of principal 
the gain from write off of carrying value in excess of principal resulted from the payoff of our debt with cisco capital using the proceeds from our initial public offering in november  and represents the carrying value in excess of principal remaining from the troubled debt restructuring that occurred in loss on disposal of property and equipment 
we record losses on the disposal of equipment primarily when customer premise equipment integrated access devices is not returned to us following the disconnection of customers from our service 
we also record losses on the impairment or disposition of assets  primarily network equipment that has become obsolete or is no longer in service and software licenses that are no longer in use 
in addition  we write down the unrealized value of certain marketable securities to their fair market value if their value is dependent on variable interest rates and they are unlikely to recover their value in the near future 
income tax expense 
in may  the texas legislature enacted reforms of the texas franchise tax system and replaced it with a new tax system  referred to as the texas margin tax 
due to our operations in dallas and houston  we will be subject to this tax when it becomes effective in january the texas margin tax has been interpreted to be an income tax for accounting purposes and is expected to increase our annual state income tax expense by approximately million in if this tax had been in effect for  its effect on income tax expense would have been approximately million 
aside from the texas margin tax  we anticipate paying minimal income taxes over the next several years due primarily to our net operating loss carryforwards  although  we expect we will have some payments due under the alternative minimum tax 
we have applied a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset of approximately million  the majority of which relates to net operating loss carryforwards 
we reassess the appropriateness of our valuation allowance periodically as circumstances warrant  including at december  our conclusion to continue to record a full valuation allowance is based on our recent cumulative book and tax loss history  after excluding the gain related to the early payoff of debt  and the uncertainty of future taxable income due to  among other items  risks of accelerating the opening of new markets  industry consolidation and its effect on regulation and competition  the potential for rapid technological changes  and the highly competitive environment in which we operate in general

revenue increased  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  the increase in revenue resulted from the increase in customers from december  to december  and recognizing promotional breakage of million in the twelve months ended december   and million in the twelve months ended december  related to certain customer promotional liabilities recorded in prior periods  offset by a slight decline in average monthly revenue per customer location from the twelve months ended december  to the twelve months ended december  despite the various factors contributing to the decline of average monthly revenue per customer location  as discussed above  we expect average monthly revenue per customer location to be relatively stable in future periods or to grow moderately due to increased revenue from our mobile service and other value added applications 
revenues from access charges paid to us by other communications companies to terminate calls to our customers increased for the twelve month comparison period primarily due to our growth in customers 
our segment contributions to the increase in revenue in the twelve month period ended december  as compared to the twelve month period ended december   were million from atlanta  million from dallas  million from denver  million from houston  and million from chicago 
los angeles  which was launched in march  had revenues of million for the twelve months ended december  cost of service 
cost of service increased  from the twelve month period of to the twelve month period of as a percentage of total revenue  cost of service increased from in the twelve months ended december  to in the twelve months ended december  the increase in cost of service was mostly attributable to the increase in the average number of customers from december  to december  the remaining increase in cost of service  as well as the increase as a percentage of 
table of contents revenue  relates primarily to the impact of regulatory changes and increased level of installation charges to affect circuit changes in connection with our network optimization plan in response to the trro 
circuit access fees  or line charges  which primarily relate to our lease of t circuits connecting our equipment at network points of colocation to our equipment located at our customers premises  represented the largest component of cost of service 
the increase in circuit access fees is a direct result of the increase in the number of customers  as well as a rise in circuit access fees due to the impact of the trro and regulatory rulings in georgia 
the other principal components of cost of service include long distance charges  installation costs to connect new circuits  the cost of transport circuits between network points of presence  the cost of local interconnection with the local telephone companies networks  internet access costs  the cost of third party applications we provide to our customers  access costs paid by us to other carriers to terminate calls from our customers and certain taxes and fees  and  beginning in  the costs of mobile handsets 
as a percent of revenue  other costs of service increased for the twelve months ended december  primarily due to the impact of our network grooming activities  which involve changes in network architecture to improve efficiency or reduce costs related to the trro described below  and the impact of our new mobile offering  which involves subsidies on the sale of mobile handsets and a lower gross margin for mobile service than our overall gross margin 
although our mobile services do not currently constitute a principal component of our cost of service  we expect that as our mobile services increase over time  they will represent a larger component of our cost of service 
in february  the georgia public service commission the psc ordered a rate increase for the lease of unbundled network elements provided by bellsouth 
the increased rates are applicable both prospectively and retroactively to june the company estimated and accrued approximately million through december  for the cumulative impact of this action  which was charged to cost of service in the fourth quarter of prior to the psc staff recommendation  there was insufficient information as to whether the outcome of this matter would result in a change in pricing and whether such change in pricing  if any  would be applied retroactively or prospectively 
during the year ended december   the company accrued an additional million relating to the new pricing  resulting in a total accrual of million as of december  although the company continues to negotiate the final settlement of the retroactive payment due  the recorded accrual represents management s best estimate of the ultimate settlement of this matter 
in february  the fcc issued its trro and adopted new rules  effective march   governing the obligations of incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  to afford access to certain of their network elements  if at all  and the cost of such facilities 
the trro reduces the ilecs obligations to provide high capacity loops within  and dedicated transport facilities between  certain of the ilecs wire centers that are deemed to be sufficiently competitive  based upon various factors such as the number of fiber based colocators and or the number of business access lines within these wire centers 
in addition  certain caps are imposed regarding the number of unbundled network element  or une  facilities that companies like us may have on a single route or into a single building 
where the wire center conditions or the caps are exceeded  the trro eliminates the ilecs obligations to provide these high capacity circuits to competitors at the discounted rates historically received under the telecommunications act 
the rates charged by ilecs for our high capacity circuits in place on march  that were affected by the fcc s new rules were increased effective for one year until march in addition  by march   we were required by the fcc s new rules to transition these existing facilities to alternative arrangements  such as other competitive facilities or to other wholesale arrangements offered by the ilecs eg  special access services or other negotiated rates with the ilecs 
subject to any contractual protections under our existing interconnection agreements with ilecs or amendments to such agreements  beginning march   new circuits that were added were subject to the ilecs higher special access pricing 
new circuits include any new 
table of contents installations of ds loops and or ds and ds transport facilities in the affected ilecs wire centers  on the affected transport routes or that exceeded the caps 
we are able to estimate the probable liability for implementation of certain provisions of the trro and have accrued approximately million through december  for these increased costs  million of which was charged to cost of service in the year ended december  this cumulative estimate includes million for the total cost impact related to wire centers and transport routes determined to be sufficiently competitive to be subject to the fcc s new rules  of which million is reflected in cost of service through december  this cumulative estimate also includes million for costs associated with the caps imposed on the number of circuits that we may have on a single route or into a single building  of which approximately million is reflected in cost of service through december  this estimate is for all markets and  where alternate pricing agreements have not been reached  is based on special access rates available under volume and or term pricing plans 
we believe volume and or term pricing plans are the most probable pricing regime to which we are subject to based on our experience and our intent to enter into volume and or term commitments where more attractively priced alternatives do not exist 
certain aspects of the new fcc rules are subject to ongoing court challenges and the implementation of the new fcc rules is subject to multiple interpretations 
we cannot predict the results of future court rulings  or how the fcc may respond to any such rulings  or any changes in the availability of unbundled network elements as the result of future legislative or regulatory decisions 
we made changes in our network architecture via a network optimization project to mitigate the increases in transport circuit costs resulting from the fcc rule changes 
this network optimization project  undertaken in response to the trro  was completed in the quarter ended june  and resulted in million in installation expenses during the six months ended june   which included million for additional network optimization efforts inspired by the trro related project 
these additional network optimization efforts continued during the remainder of  in which we incurred an additional million in installation expenses 
we believe that these network optimization efforts will be an ongoing part of our business in future periods  although they may not result in significant installation expenses in each period 
selling  general and administrative dollar amounts in thousands twelve months ended december  december  change from previous period dollars of revenues dollars of revenues dollars percent selling  general and administrative exclusive of depreciation and amortization salaries  wages and benefits excluding share based compensation share based compensation marketing costs other selling  general and administrative total sg a other operating expenses public offering expenses nm other data employees selling  general and administrative expenses and other operating expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses  excluding share based compensation expense  increased at a slower rate than our 
table of contents revenue or customers for the twelve month period ended december  this change is evidenced by its decline as a percentage of revenue from in the twelve month period ended december  to in the twelve month period ended december  however  this decrease was partially offset by costs associated with the march launch of operations in los angeles  our introduction of mobile services in all our markets during the first quarter of and increased cost associated with being a public company 
we expect selling  general and administrative costs  excluding share based compensation expense  to continue to decrease over time as a percentage of revenue as our customer base and revenues grow without proportional increases in our expenses 
salaries  wages and benefits  which include commissions paid to our direct sales representatives  comprised the largest portion of our selling  general and administrative expenses for all comparison periods 
the primary factor increasing this category of costs is the growth in employees as the company grows 
however  the growth in the cost of benefits  such as medical insurance payments made by us  per employee  caused this expense line item to grow at a faster rate than the number of employees 
marketing costs  including advertising  increased in absolute dollars  as we have increased our marketing efforts into new mediums to address the increasingly competitive environment  but decreased as a percent of revenues 
our marketing costs will continue to increase as we add customers and expand to new markets 
other selling  general and administrative expenses include professional fees  outsourced services  rent and other facilities costs  maintenance  recruiting fees  travel and entertainment costs  property taxes and bad debt expense 
the increase in this category of costs is primarily due to the addition of new operations needed to keep pace with the growth in customers and the cost of being a public company  including preparing for sarbanes oxley act compliance  and professional fees associated with a heightened level of regulatory activity 
as a percentage of revenue  other selling  general and administrative costs decreased for the twelve month period ended december  when compared to the comparable period of due to realizing efficiencies from achieving economies of scale

depreciation and amortization expense increased million between the twelve month periods ended december  and depreciation and amortization expense increased because new purchases exceeded the reduction in depreciation and amortization resulting from property and equipment becoming fully depreciated

loss on disposal of property and equipment 
our loss on disposal of equipment increased by less than million for the twelve month period ended december  compared to december  our loss principally consists of unrecoverable integrated access devices from disconnected customers and write offs of certain network and software assets that we replaced due to obsolescence or upgrade 
the loss on unrecoverable integrated access devices will continue to increase as our customer base grows  and the write off of certain network and software assets will fluctuate dependent upon management decisions to replace and upgrade components of our network 
gain from write off of carrying value in excess of principal

revenue increased  for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  the increase in revenue resulted from the increase in customers from december  to december  between these periods  the ending number of customers increased by and the average number of customers increased by 
average monthly revenue per customer location declined by  from december  to december  although the proportion of our customers purchasing our beyondvoice ii and beyondvoice iii service packages  at higher average monthly revenue per customer location  was higher in the twelve months ended december  than in the twelve months ended december   the impact of this trend was more than offset by the effect of increased levels of customers under three year contracts at lower price points and competitive pricing pressure on new contracts and contract renewals  resulting in a higher level of promotions offered to customers at the time of contract signature 
revenues from access charges paid to us by other communications companies to terminate calls to our customers declined for the twelve month comparison period and grew substantially slower than our customer base due to reductions in access rates on interstate calls as mandated by the fcc  including an approximate reduction effective in june our segment contributions to the increase in revenue in the twelve month period ended december  as compared to the twelve month period ended december   were million from atlanta  million from dallas  million from denver  million from houston  which was launched in march  and million from chicago  which was launched in march cost of service 
cost of service increased  from the twelve month period of to the twelve month period of as a percentage of total revenue  cost of service increased from in the twelve months of to in the twelve months of the increase in cost of service was largely attributable to the 
table of contents increase in the number of customers from december  to december  and a increase in the average number of customers between the periods 
the increase in cost of service beyond the growth in customers  as well as the increase as a percentage of revenue  relates primarily to the impact of regulatory changes and to a million decrease in the level of service credits and performance penalties 
service credits  which are recognized as offsets to cost of service  arise from billing and service disputes between telecommunications carriers and us 
circuit access fees  or line charges  which primarily relate to our lease of t circuits connecting our equipment at network points of colocation to our equipment located at our customers premises  represented the largest component of cost of service 
the increase in circuit access fees between the twelve month periods is primarily a result of the increase in the number of customers 
in addition to the increase resulting from customer growth  circuit access fees rose due to the impact of the trro and recent regulatory rulings in georgia  which included million relating to prior periods being recognized as expense during the other principal components of cost of service include long distance charges  installation costs to connect new circuits  the cost of transport circuits between network points of presence  the cost of local interconnection with the local telephone companies networks  internet access costs  the cost of third party applications we provide to our customers  access costs paid by us to other carriers to terminate calls from our customers  and certain taxes and fees 
as a percent of revenue  other costs of service decreased for the twelve months ended december  this overall decrease is the result of negotiated price decreases with vendors and other cost savings that we achieved through network optimization efforts 
in february  the georgia public service commission  or psc  adopted a recommendation by the staff of the psc to implement increased rates for the lease of unes from bellsouth 
this recommendation relates to a complaint filed by bellsouth in with the psc 
the increase rates implemented by the psc are applicable going forward and on a retroactive basis back to september we estimated and accrued approximately million through december  for the cumulative impact of this action  which was charged to cost of service in december prior to the psc staff recommendation  there was insufficient information as to whether the outcome of this matter would result in a change in pricing and whether such change in pricing  if any  would be applied retroactively or prospectively 
in february  the fcc issued its trro and adopted new rules  effective march   governing the obligations of ilecs  to afford access to their facilities as unes at wholesale prices based on incremental cost 
the trro reduces the ilecs obligations to provide une high capacity loops within  and une dedicated transport facilities between  certain ilec wire centers that are deemed to be sufficiently competitive  based upon various factors such as the number of fiber based colocators and or the number of business access lines within these wire centers 
in addition  certain caps are imposed regarding the number of une facilities that companies like us may have on a single route or into a single building 
where the wire center conditions or the caps are exceeded  the trro eliminates the ilecs obligations to provide these high capacity circuits as unes 
the rates charged by ilecs for our high capacity circuits in place on march  that were affected by the fcc s new rules were increased effective for one year until march in addition  by march   we were required by the fcc s new rules to transition these existing facilities to alternative arrangements  such as other competitive facilities or to other wholesale arrangements offered by the ilecs eg  special access services or other negotiated rates with the ilecs 
subject to any contractual protections under our existing interconnection agreements with ilecs  beginning march   new circuits in affected areas that are added are subject to the ilecs higher special access pricing 
new circuits in affected areas include any new installations of ds loops and or ds and ds transport facilities in the affected ilec wire centers  on the affected transport routes or that exceeded the caps 
we are able to estimate the probable liability for implementation of certain provisions of the trro and accrued approximately million through december  for these liabilities  which were charged to cost 
table of contents of service in the year ended december  this estimate includes million for the total cost impact related to wire centers and transport routes deemed sufficiently competitive 
for costs associated with the caps imposed on the number of circuits that we may have on a single route or into a single building  approximately million is reflected in the results of operations through december  although the new fcc rules themselves have been upheld in their entirety  the implementation of the new fcc rules is subject to multiple interpretations and in some cases court challenges 
we cannot predict the results of future court rulings  or how the fcc may respond to any such rulings  or any changes in the availability of unbundled network elements as the result of future legislative or regulatory decisions 
for instance  recent state regulatory rulings have reduced circuit access fees in our texas markets and increased rates in the atlanta market 
in particular  the circuit access fees and other costs that we incur in texas were reduced based on a state regulatory order that went into effect in march we began realizing benefits from this state ruling in the second quarter of we made changes in our network architecture to respond to the increases in transport circuit costs in order to mitigate the impact of the fcc rule changes

the primary factor increasing this category of costs is the growth in employees 
however  the growth in the cost of benefits  such as medical insurance payments made by the company  per employee caused this expense line item to grow at a faster rate than the number of employees

at december   our operating segments were geographic and included atlanta  dallas  denver  houston  chicago and los angeles 
we launched our newest market  san diego  in january and incurred costs in related to this launch 
although san diego is not operating as of december   the costs incurred in preparing for its launch are disclosed as a separate segment 
the balance of our operations is in our corporate group  for which the operations consist of corporate executive  administrative and support functions and centralized operations  which includes network operations  customer care and provisioning 
our corporate group is treated as a separate segment consistent with the manner in which we monitor and analyze our financial results 
we do not allocate these corporate costs to the other segments because these costs are managed and controlled on a centralized  functional basis that spans all markets  with centralized  functional management held accountable for corporate results 
we also believe that the decision not to allocate these centralized costs provides a better evaluation of our revenue producing geographic segments 
we do not report assets by segment since we manage our assets and make decisions on technology deployment and other investments on a company wide rather than a local market basis 
our chief operating decision maker does not use segment assets in evaluating the performance of our operating segments 
as a result we do not believe that segment asset disclosure is meaningful information to investors 
in addition to segment results  we use total adjusted ebitda to assess the operating performance of the overall business 
because our chief operating decision maker primarily evaluates the performance of our segments on the basis of adjusted ebitda  we believe that segment adjusted ebitda data should be available to investors so that investors have the same data that we employ in assessing our overall operations 
our chief operating decision maker also uses revenue to measure our operating results and assess performance  and both revenue and adjusted ebitda are presented herein in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
ebitda is a non gaap financial measure commonly used by investors  financial analysts and ratings agencies 
ebitda is generally defined as net income loss before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
however  we use the non gaap financial measure adjusted ebitda  which  in our case  when applicable  further excludes non cash share based compensation  public offering expenses  gains relating to our troubled debt restructuring and the early payoff of our restructured debt  gain or loss on asset dispositions and other non operating income or expense 
we have presented adjusted ebitda because this financial measure  in combination with revenue and operating expense  is an integral part of the internal reporting system used by our management to assess and evaluate the performance of our business and its operating segments both on a consolidated and on an individual basis 
other public companies may define adjusted ebitda in a different manner or present varying financial measures 
accordingly  our presentation may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other 
table of contents companies 
our calculation of adjusted ebitda is also not directly comparable to ebit earnings before interest and taxes or ebitda 
we believe that adjusted ebitda  while providing useful information  should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to other financial measures determined under gaap  such as operating income or loss

table of contents the operating results from our operating segments reflect the costs of a pre launch phase in each market in which the local network is installed and initial staffing is hired  followed by a startup phase  beginning with the launch of service operations  when customer installations begin 
our sales efforts  our service offerings and the prices we charge customers for our services are generally consistent across our operating segments 
operating expenses include cost of service and selling  general and administrative costs incurred directly in the markets where we serve customers 
although our network design and market operations are generally consistent across all our operating segments  certain costs differ among the various geographical markets 
these cost differences result from different numbers of network central office colocations  prices charged by the local telephone companies for customer t access circuits  prices charged by local telephone companies and other telecommunications providers for transport circuits  office rents and other costs that vary by region 
we record costs in our markets prior to launching service to customers 
we launched service in atlanta in april  in dallas in september  in denver in january  in houston in march  in chicago in march  and in los angeles in march  in addition  we have launched san diego as of january in the last quarter of  we incurred expenses primarily relating to the staffing of our chicago office and the cost of obtaining network circuits in chicago 
in the fourth quarter of  we began incurring expenses primarily relating to the staffing of our los angeles office and the cost of obtaining network circuits in los angeles

we raised million from issuance of equity securities in december and another approximately million of net proceeds from our initial public offering in november total outstanding borrowings  of million  which were all with cisco capital  were repaid in november with proceeds from our initial public offering  and the credit facility was terminated 
cash flows from operations 
cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities of million from to is primarily comprised of an increase in net income loss of million  an elimination of million in interest expense associated with the reduction in carrying value in excess of principal from the restructuring of a portion of our cisco capital debt in  an increase of million in non cash share based compensation expense associated with the adoption of sfas r  
table of contents share based payment  an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million resulting from the growth in assets arising from the growth in customers and the addition of assets needed to support our newer markets  which include houston  chicago and los angeles  an increase of million related to the non cash gain recognized upon the payoff of our credit facility with cisco capital in  an increase of million from other assets  an increase of million from prepaid expenses and other current assets and an increase of million in other accrued expenses 
these increases in cash flow from operations were primarily offset by a decrease of million in accounts payable  a decrease of million from accounts receivable and a decrease of million from our change in inventory 
cash provided by operating activities was million in the year ended december  and million in the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities of million from to is primarily comprised of a decrease in net loss of million  an increase in the provision for doubtful accounts of million resulting from our increase in customers  an increase of million from interest expense associated with the reduction in carrying value in excess of principal from the restructuring of a portion of our cisco capital debt in  an increase of million from net changes in operating assets and liabilities and an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million resulting from the growth in assets arising from the growth in customers and the addition of assets needed to support our new operations in houston and chicago 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities was offset by a decrease of million from loss on disposal of property and equipment due to an improvement in recovery of integrated access devices from disconnected customers  a decrease of million from the write down of marketable securities  a decrease of million in non cash share based compensation and a decrease of million from the gain recognized upon the payoff of our credit facility with cisco capital 
cash flows from investing activities 
our principal cash investments are historically for purchases of property and equipment and for purchases of marketable securities 
cash purchases of property and equipment primarily include network capital expenditures such as integrated access devices  t aggregation routers  trunking gateway routers  softswitches  other network routers  associated growth expenditures related to these items  diagnostic and test equipment  certain colocation and data center buildout expenditures and equipment installation costs  and non network capital expenditures  such as the cost of software licenses and implementation costs associated with our operational support systems as well as our financial and administrative systems  servers and other equipment needed to support our software packages  personal computers  internal communications equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to our office space 
our cash purchases of property and equipment were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in and prior periods  network related capital expenditures were primarily financed through our credit facility with cisco capital and  accordingly  were non cash transactions 
after giving consideration to non cash purchases of property and equipment  capital expenditures increased million from the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  our capital expenditures resulted from growth in customers in our existing markets  network additions needed to support our entry into new markets  and enhancements and development costs related to our operational support systems in order to offer additional applications and services to our customers 
we expect that future capital expenditures will continue to be concentrated in these areas 
we believe that capital efficiency is a key advantage of the ip based network technology that we employ 
we also experienced a decrease of million in net cash flows from investment redemptions and purchases for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  during  total purchases from cisco systems were approximately million 
we invest excess cash balances in the marketable securities of highly rated commercial paper 
purchases of marketable securities were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we periodically redeem our marketable securities in order to transfer the funds into other operating and investing activities 
we redeemed million  million and million in  and  respectively 

table of contents non cash purchases of property and equipment 
purchases of property and equipment through our credit facility with cisco capital  which terminated in november  were recorded as non cash purchases because they were directly financed by cisco capital without the exchange of cash for the assets that we purchased 
network capital expenditures include the purchase of integrated access devices  t aggregation routers  trunking gateway routers  softswitches  other network routers  associated growth expenditures related to these items  diagnostic and test equipment  certain colocation and data center buildout expenditures and equipment installation costs 
our non cash additions to property and equipment were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in non cash purchases of property and equipment from to was due to reduced purchases  pricing for network components obtained and network efficiencies gained through the growth of our customer base in each market 
as noted above  the balance of our debt under the cisco capital credit facility was repaid in november using a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering and the facility was terminated 
therefore  there were no non cash purchases of property and equipment after november relating to our credit facility with cisco capital 
cash flows from financing activities 
cash flows used in financing activities were million in the year ended december  compared to cash flows provided by financing activities of in the year ended december  the principal component of cash flows provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was proceeds from the exercise of stock options of million 
the primary use of cash in the year ended december  was the repayment of long term debt and capital leases of million offset by proceeds from our initial public offering of approximately million 
we had no payments on long term debt in due to the payoff of our debt after our initial public offering in november the increase in cash flows used in financing activities of million from the year ended to is due to the repayment of principal on our debt of million  a million preferred stock offering in and a decrease in the amount of proceeds from new borrowings of million  offset by proceeds from our initial public offering of approximately million  an increase of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock arising from increased exercises of stock options and a decrease of million in financing issuance costs relating to amendments made to our loan with cisco capital and to our series c preferred stock 
upon the completion of our november  initial public offering we used a portion of our net proceeds of approximately million to pay million of principal and terminate our credit facility with cisco capital 
we believe that cash on hand plus cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to fund capital expenditures  operating expenses and other cash requirements associated with our present market expansion plan 
we anticipate launching operations into at least five additional markets by the end of  including three new markets by the end of  of which san diego was launched in january our long term cash requirements include the capital necessary to fund this next phase of our market expansion 
our business plan assumes that cash flow from operating activities of our mature markets will offset the negative cash flow from operating activities and cash flow from financing activities with respect to our five or more additional markets as they are launched on a staggered basis over the next three years 
we intend to adhere to our policy of fully funding all future market expansions in advance and do not anticipate entering markets without having more than sufficient cash on hand to cover projected cash needs 
financing arrangements with cisco capital 
in  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with our former principal lender cisco capital  under which cisco capital agreed to provide up to million in available credit 
this credit facility was subsequently amended to reduce the amount of available credit to million 
we paid off all outstanding principal and accrued interest owed under this facility  which was million  with part of the proceeds of our initial public offering and terminated the facility 
in connection with amendments to our credit facility in november  we granted to cisco capital warrants which permitted cisco capital to acquire up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price

revenue derived from local voice and data services is billed monthly in advance and deferred until earned at the end of the month 
revenues derived from other telecommunications services  including long distance  excess charges over monthly rate plans and terminating access fees from other carriers  are recognized monthly as services are provided and billed in arrears 
revenue derived from customer installation and activation  which represented less than of total revenues in and  is deferred and amortized over the average estimated customer life of three years on a straight line basis 
most of our customers enter a three year contract with us 
accordingly  we do not have sufficient experience to estimate whether the average customer life will in fact exceed the term of the customer contract and use the shorter contract period for purposes of amortizing revenues and costs from customer installation and activation 
related installation costs are deferred only to the extent that revenue is deferred and are amortized on a straight line basis in proportion to revenue recognized 
mobile handset revenue is recognized at the time of shipment 
contractual termination fees are billed to the customer  but revenue from these fees is not recognized until payment is received 
our marketing promotions include various rebates and customer reimbursements that fall under the scope of eitf issue no 
 accounting for points and certain other time based or volume based sales incentive offers  and offers for free products or services to be delivered in the future  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
in accordance with these pronouncements  we record any promotions as a reduction in revenue when earned by the customer 
for promotions earned over time  we ratably allocate the cost of honoring the promotions over the period required for eligibility as a reduction in revenue 
eitf also requires that measurement of the obligation should be based on the estimated number of customers that will ultimately earn and claim the promotion 
accordingly  we recognize the benefit of estimated breakage on customer promotions when such amounts are reasonably estimable 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts through charges to selling  general and administrative expense 
the allowance is established based upon the amount we ultimately expect to collect from customers  and is estimated based on a number of factors  including a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  as well as general factors  such as the length of time the receivables are past due  historical collection experience and the general economic environment 
customer accounts are written off against the allowance upon disconnection of the customers service  at which time the accounts are deemed to be uncollectible 
generally  customer accounts are considered delinquent and the service disconnection process commences when they are sixty days in arrears 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  or if economic conditions worsened  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of our expenses could result 

table of contents impairment of long lived assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
if an indication of impairment is present  we compare the asset s estimated fair value to its carrying amount 
if the estimated fair value of the asset is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we record an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying amount over its fair value 
the fair value is determined based on valuation techniques such as a comparison to fair values of similar assets or using a discounted cash flow analysis 
share based compensation 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas  accounting for share based compensation 
under this guidance  we recognized non cash compensation expense for stock options by measuring the excess  if any  of the estimated fair value of the common stock at the date of grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock and amortizing that excess on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the applicable stock options 
additional paid in capital and deferred compensation were recorded at the date of the grants to reflect the intrinsic value of the awards 
under apb  the deferred compensation was amortized to expense over the vesting periods on a straight line basis  with adjustments for forfeitures as they occurred 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under that transition method  compensation cost recognized on or after january  includes a compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and b compensation cost for all share based payments granted on or after january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas r 
results for prior periods have not been restated 
under sfas r  compensation is recorded over the vesting period directly to paid in capital 
thus  upon adoption  the company eliminated the deferred compensation balance relating to employee stock options with an offsetting reduction to additional paid in capital 
the impact of adopting sfas r was an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million in the year ended december  as of december   total unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested awards totals approximately million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
we evaluate the appropriateness of the underlying assumptions each time we estimate the fair value of equity instruments requiring measurement under sfas r 
to assist us in validating our assumptions  we periodically engage consultants  as we did in  with relevant experience to assess and evaluate our assumptions 
the risk free interest rate used in estimating the fair value of options is based on the us treasury zero coupon securities using the contractual term of the option 
we also use historical data  stratified into employee groups that exhibit similar behavior  to estimate the term that options are expected to be outstanding and the forfeiture rate of options granted 
through the first quarter of  we stratified employees into four groups for these purposes 
beginning in the second quarter of  we reduced our stratification to two employee groups because three of the previously stratified employee groups did not exhibit substantially different behavior over time and  accordingly  yield similar valuations 
because we are a recently public company and therefore do not have our own volatility history to rely upon  expected volatility is based on historical volatilities experienced by companies considered representative of us based on four primary categories size  stage of lifecycle  capital structure and industry 
this approach to estimating volatility has remained consistent over time  although the mix and weighting of representative volatilities has been refined periodically to ensure that the four primary categories are appropriately considered 
through the first quarter of  we included certain indices  including 
table of contents a small cap index and a telecom index  as part of the representative group 
effective in the second quarter of  we refined our representative group and included only individual stocks in our volatility analysis 
in reviewing the modifications to the development of our underlying valuation assumptions  we considered whether applying the refined assumptions would have had a material impact on recent valuations performed using the previous assumptions  noting that the effect on compensation expenses would not have resulted in a materially different amount 
through  we granted only stock options to our employees 
beginning in  we are expanding our share based compensation to include grants of restricted shares 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
we have established allowances that we use in connection with valuing expense charges associated with our deferred tax assets 
our valuation allowance for our net deferred tax asset is designed to take into account the uncertainty surrounding the realization of our net operating losses and our other deferred tax assets in the event that we record positive income for income tax purposes 
for federal and state tax purposes  our net operating loss carry forwards could be subject to significant limitations on annual use 
to account for this uncertainty  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax asset 
as a result  the value of our net deferred tax assets on our balance sheet is zero 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  which is a revision of sfas sfas r supersedes apb no 
and amends sfas no 
 statement of cash flows 
generally the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the statement of operations based on their fair values 
pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative upon adopting sfas r 
sfas r permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods a modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of sfas r for all share based payments granted after the effective date and b based on the requirements of sfas r for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of sfas r that remain unvested on the effective date 
a modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above  but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously recognized under sfas for purposes of pro forma disclosures either a all prior periods presented or b prior interim periods of the year of adoption 
we adopted sfas r on january  following the modified prospective method 
however  had we adopted sfas r in prior periods  the impact would have approximated the impact of sfas as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share in note to the financial statements 
in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting changes and error corrections a replacement of apb opinion no 
and fasb statement no 
sfas 
the fasb issued sfas to provide guidance on the accounting for and reporting of error corrections 
unless otherwise impracticable  it establishes retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
sfas also provides guidance for determining whether retrospective application is impracticable and for reporting an accounting change when retrospective application is impracticable 
furthermore  this statement addresses the reporting of a correction of an error in previously issued financial statements by restating previously issued financial statements 
sfas is effective for financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  we have adopted sfas effective 
table of contents january   and the adoption of this statement did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
in addition  it provides guidance on the measurement  derecognition  classification and disclosure of tax positions  as well as the accounting for related interest and penalties 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are evaluating the effect of fin on our financial statements and have not determined the impact that the adoption will have on our results of operations  cash flows and financial position 
in june  the emerging issues task force issued eitf issue no 
 how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation eitf 
eitf provides guidance regarding accounting for certain taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are imposed on and concurrent with specific revenue producing transactions between a seller and a customer 
these taxes and surcharges include  among others  universal service fund charges  sales  use  value added  and some excise taxes 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of eitf but do not believe the adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurement sfas 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies to other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we are currently evaluating the requirements of sfas and have not yet determined the impact that the adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all of our financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk are entered into for purposes other than trading 
our primary market risk exposure is related to our marketable securities 
we place our marketable securities investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards as specified in our investment policy guidelines 
at december   all investments were in short term commercial paper and  accordingly  had no financial instruments sensitive to market risk for fluctuations in interest rates
