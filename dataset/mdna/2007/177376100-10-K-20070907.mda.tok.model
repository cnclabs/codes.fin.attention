item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december   in the fourth quarter of  the audit committee of our board of directors commenced a voluntary  independent investigation of certain of our stock option granting practices and related accounting during the period from january through december this investigation was conducted by the audit committee with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel and outside forensic accounting consultants 
in addition  management further evaluated all grants in december  which was the month we completed our initial public offering  and all grants to non employee directors 
the audit committee and management completed its review in the second quarter of based on the facts obtained in connection with the audit committee s and management s review  we have concluded that stock options granted during the period from december to march  were accounted for using incorrect measurement dates  which required a restatement of our previously filed financial statements 
to date  we have incurred significant expenses related to legal  accounting  tax and other professional services in connection with the review of our historical stock option granting practices and the related restatements  and may incur significant expenses in the future with respect to such matters  including as a result of regulatory inquiries or proceedings  litigation matters or additional cash and non cash charges 
the occurrence of any or all of these events  even if resolved favorably  may be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcomes of regulatory proceedings or litigation matters are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of the review of our historical stock option granting practices and the associated restatements  we could not file our periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  on time and  as a result  faced the possibility that our stock would be delisted from the nasdaq global select market 
with the filing of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly reports on form q for the three months ended march  and june   we believe we have returned to full compliance with sec reporting requirements and nasdaq listing requirements and expect that the 
table of contents nasdaq delisting matter will be closed 
if  however  the sec has comments on this annual report on form k for the year ended december   our quarterly reports on form q for the three months ended march  and june  or other reports that we have previously filed that require us to file amended reports  or if nasdaq does not concur that we are in compliance with applicable listing requirements  we may be unable to maintain an effective listing of our stock on a national securities exchange 
if this happens  the price of our common stock and the ability of our stockholders to trade in our stock could be adversely affected 
in addition  we would be subject to a number of restrictions regarding the registration of our stock under federal securities laws  and we would not be able to issue stock options or other equity awards to our employees or allow them to exercise outstanding options  which could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
additionally  as described in the explanatory note to this annual report on form k for the year ended december   management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii item and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  in part iv item  after completion by the audit committee of its investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and our review of the accounting treatment for our historical stock option grants  we recorded additional stock based compensation expenses and related tax effects with regard to certain past stock option grants  and we restated previously issued financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  although we believe we have made appropriate judgments in determining the financial and tax impacts of our historical stock option granting practices and have consulted with the office of the chief accountant of the sec on certain interpretive matters  we cannot provide assurance that the sec or the internal revenue service  or irs  will agree with the manner in which we have accounted for and reported  or not reported  the financial and tax impacts 
specifically  in light of the significant judgment used in establishing revised measurement dates  alternate approaches to those used by us could have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and those differences could be considered material 
we considered various alternative approaches and believe that the approaches used by us were appropriate under the circumstances 
for a complete discussion of the judgments underlying the revised measurement dates  see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in part ii  item of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  if the sec or the irs disagrees with our financial or tax adjustments and such disagreement results in material changes to our historical financial statements  we may be required to further restate our prior financial statements  amend prior filings with the sec or take other action that is not currently contemplated 
in addition  other adjustments for non operating cash charges may be required in connection with the resolution of stock option related matters arising under any litigation or regulatory reviews commenced against us 
our long sales cycle for enterprise wide sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period 
in recent quarters  a growing number of our large and medium sized customers have decided to implement our enterprise customer license arrangements on a departmental or enterprise wide basis 
our long sales cycle for these large scale deployments makes it difficult to predict when these sales will occur  and we may not be able to sustain these sales on a predictable basis 
we have a long sales cycle for these enterprise wide sales because our sales force generally needs to explain and demonstrate the benefits of a large scale deployment of our product to potential and existing customers prior to sale  our service personnel typically spend a significant amount of time assisting potential customers in their testing and evaluation of our products and services  our customers are typically large and medium size organizations that carefully research their technology needs and the many potential projects prior to making capital expenditures for software infrastructure  and before making a purchase  our potential customers usually must get approvals from various levels of decision makers within their organizations  and this process can be lengthy 
the continued long sales cycle for these large scale deployment sales could make it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur 
delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenue and operating results for any particular period 

table of contents we face intense competition  which could result in fewer customer orders and reduced revenues and margins 
we sell our products in intensely competitive markets 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources than we do 
for example  our ability to market our application virtualization products  including presentation server  the access suite  access essentials  password manager and other future product offerings  could be affected by microsoft s licensing and pricing scheme for client devices  servers and applications 
further  the announcement of the release  and the actual release  of new windows based server operating systems or products incorporating similar features to our products could cause our existing and potential customers to postpone or cancel plans to license certain of our existing and future product and service offerings 
in addition  alternative products for application delivery directly and indirectly compete with our current product lines and our online services 
existing or new products and services that provide alternatives to our products and services  including those relating to application virtualization  web application optimization  application performance monitoring  branch office application delivery and wan optimization  virtual desktop delivery  secure sockets layers virtual private network  gateways  on demand assistance  online collaboration and ip telephony  can materially impact our ability to compete in these markets 
our current competitors in these markets include adobe systems  inc  cisco systems  inc  emc corporation  f networks  inc  hewlett packard company  ibm corporation  juniper networks  inc  microsoft corporation  oracle corporation  riverbed technology  inc  sun microsystems  inc  vmware and webex communications  inc 
as the markets for our products and services continue to develop  additional companies  including companies with significant market presence in the computer appliances  software and networking industries  could enter the markets in which we compete and further intensify competition 
in addition  we believe price competition could become a more significant competitive factor in the future 
as a result  we may not be able to maintain our historic prices and margins  which could adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
sales of products within our application virtualization product line constitute a majority of our revenue and decreases in demand for our application virtualization products could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate that sales of products within our application virtualization product line and related enhancements will constitute a majority of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
our ability to continue to generate revenue from our application virtualization products will depend on market acceptance of windows server operating systems and or unix operating systems 
declines and variability in demand for our application virtualization products could occur as a result of new competitive product releases and updates to existing products  termination of our product offerings and enhancements  potential market saturation  technological change  general economic conditions  or lack of success of entities with which we have a technology relationship 
if our customers do not continue to purchase our application virtualization products as a result of these or other factors  our revenue would decrease and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
in addition  modification or termination of certain of our application virtualization products may cause variability in our revenue and make it difficult to predict our revenue growth and trends in our application virtualization products as our customers adjust their purchasing decisions in response to such events 
if we do not develop new products and services or enhancements to our existing products and services  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the markets for our products and services are characterized by rapid technological change  evolving industry standards  fluctuations in customer demand  changes in customer requirements  and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements 

table of contents our future success depends on our ability to continually enhance our current products and services and develop and introduce new products and services that our customers choose to buy 
if we are unable to keep pace with technological developments and customer demands by introducing new products and services and enhancements  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our future success could be hindered by delays in our introduction of new products and services  delays in market acceptance of new products and services or new releases of our current products and services  and our  or a competitor s  announcement of new product or service enhancements or technologies that could replace or shorten the life cycle of our existing product and service offerings 
for example  we cannot guarantee that our application delivery infrastructure products will achieve the broad market acceptance by our channel and entities with which we have a technology relationship  customers and prospective customers necessary to generate significant revenue 
in addition  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new product announcements by others 
if we experience material delays or sales shortfalls with respect to our new products and services or new releases of our current products and services  those delays or shortfalls could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we believe that we could incur additional costs and royalties as we develop  license or buy new technologies or enhancements to our existing products 
these added costs and royalties could increase our cost of revenues and operating expenses 
however  we cannot currently quantify the costs for such transactions that have not yet occurred 
in addition  we may need to use a substantial portion of our cash and investments to fund these additional costs 
our business could be adversely impacted by a failure to renew our agreements with microsoft for source code access 
in december  we entered into a five year technology collaboration and licensing agreement with microsoft corporation and in september  we entered into a three year source code license with microsoft corporation for the general release version of windows server these arrangements include a new technology initiative for closer collaboration on terminal server functionality in future server operating systems  continued access to source code for key components of microsoft s current and future server operating systems  and a patent cross licensing agreement 
the technology collaboration and licensing agreement replaces the agreement we signed with microsoft in may that provided us access to microsoft windows server source code for current and future microsoft server operating systems  including access to windows server and terminal services source code 
there can be no assurances that our current agreements with microsoft will be extended or renewed by microsoft after their respective expirations or that we will enter into new collaboration agreements with microsoft with respect to future product offerings and enhancements 
in addition  microsoft could terminate the current agreements before the expiration of the term for breach or upon a change of control 
the early termination or the failure to renew certain terms of our current agreements with microsoft in a manner favorable to us  the failure to enter into new collaboration agreements with us or a strategic collaboration between microsoft and our competitors could negatively impact the timing of our release of future products and enhancements 
if we lose key personnel or cannot hire enough qualified employees  our ability to manage our business could be adversely affected 
our success depends  in large part  upon the services of a number of key employees 
except for certain key employees of acquired businesses  we do not have long term employment agreements with any of our key personnel 
any officer or employee can terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
the effective management of our growth  if any  could depend upon our ability to retain our highly skilled technical  managerial  finance and marketing personnel 
if any of those employees leave  we will need to attract and retain replacements for them 
we may also need to add key personnel in the future 
the market for these qualified employees is competitive 
we could find it difficult to successfully attract  assimilate or retain sufficiently qualified personnel in sufficient numbers 
furthermore  we may hire key personnel in connection with our future acquisitions  however  any of these employees will be able to terminate his or her relationship with us at any time 
if we cannot retain and add the necessary staff and resources for these acquired businesses  our ability to develop acquired products  markets and customers could be adversely affected 
also  we may need to hire additional personnel to develop new products  product enhancements and technologies 
if we cannot add the necessary staff and resources  our ability to develop future enhancements and features to our existing or future products could be delayed 
any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
if we fail to manage our operations and grow revenue or fail to continue to effectively control expenses  our future operating results could be adversely affected 
historically  the scope of our operations  the number of our employees and the geographic area of our operations and our revenue have grown rapidly 
in addition  we have acquired both domestic and international companies 
this growth and the assimilation of acquired operations and their employees could continue to place a significant strain on our managerial  operational and financial resources 
to manage our current growth and any future growth effectively  we need to continue to implement and improve 
table of contents additional management and financial systems and controls 
we may not be able to manage the current scope of our operations or future growth effectively and still exploit market opportunities for our products and services in a timely and cost effective way 
our future operating results could also depend on our ability to manage our expanding product lines  our marketing and sales organizations  and our client support organization as installations of our products increase 
in addition  to the extent our revenue grows  if at all  we believe that our cost of revenues and certain operating expenses could also increase 
we believe that we could incur additional costs  including royalties  as we develop  license or buy new technologies or enhancements to our existing products and services 
these added costs and royalties could increase our cost of revenues and operating expenses and lower our gross margins 
for example  due to our acquisitions and acquisitions and the anticipated growth of the acquired companies  we currently expect that our future revenue will include a greater level of revenue from appliance sales as compared to our historical level of appliance sales  which we expect will reduce our gross margins from their historical levels 
furthermore  as our income from the acquisitions and acquisitions increases  we expect that our effective tax rate may increase due to the taxable income from these acquisitions being earned primarily in our geographic locations that are taxed at a higher rate 
however  we cannot currently quantify the costs for such transactions that have not yet occurred or of these developing trends in our business 
in addition  we may need to use a substantial portion of our cash and investments or issue additional shares of our common stock to fund these additional costs 
during the past two years  a large portion of our growth has been attributable to the growth of our application virtualization products  as well as growth in our online services and application networking products 
we cannot provide any assurance that these markets and the revenues we derive from these markets will continue to grow 
in addition  over the last four years  we have grown our force of sales professionals that work closely with partners to sell to primary it buyers  including strategic it executives  network architects  it infrastructure managers and desktop operations managers  to address the multiple selling and buying opportunities presented by our expanded product lines 
these and other account penetration efforts are part of our strategy to increase the usage of our application delivery products within our customer s it organizations 
we cannot provide any assurance that this strategy will be successful or that the release of our application delivery infrastructure products or other new products or services will increase our revenue growth rate 
we cannot assure you that our operating expenses will be lower than our estimated or actual revenues in any given quarter 
if we experience a shortfall in revenue in any given quarter  we likely will not be able to further reduce operating expenses quickly in response 
any significant shortfall in revenue could immediately and adversely affect our results of operations for that quarter 
also  due to the fixed nature of many of our expenses and our current expectation for revenue growth  our income from operations and cash flows from operating and investing activities could be lower than in recent years 
acquisitions present many risks  and we may not realize the financial and strategic goals we anticipate at the time of an acquisition 
our growth is dependent upon market growth  our ability to enhance existing products and services  and our ability to introduce new products and services on a timely basis 
we intend to continue to address the need to develop new products and services and enhance existing products and services through acquisitions of other companies  product lines and or technologies 
however  acquisitions  including those of high technology companies  are inherently risky 
we cannot provide any assurance that any of our previous acquisitions  including our acquisitions over the past three years  or future acquisitions will be successful in helping us reach our financial and strategic goals either for that acquisition or for us generally or that the combined company resulting from any acquisition will continue to support the growth achieved by the companies separately 
the risks we commonly encounter in managing and integrating acquisitions are difficulties and delays integrating the operations  technologies  and products of the acquired companies  undetected errors or unauthorized use of a third party s code in products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from normal daily operations of the business  potential difficulties in completing projects associated with purchased in process research and development  entry into markets in which we have no or limited direct prior experience and where competitors have stronger market positions and which are highly competitive  
table of contents the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  and an uncertain sales and earnings stream from the acquired company  which could unexpectedly dilute our earnings 
our failure to manage growth effectively and successfully integrate acquired companies due to these or other factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
the benefits we anticipate from acquiring xensource may not be realized 
we entered into a merger agreement with xensource with the expectation that the acquisition will result in various benefits including  among other things  enhanced revenue and profits  greater market presence and development  and enhancements to our product portfolio and customer base 
we expect that the acquisition will move us into adjacent server and desktop virtualization markets that will allow us to extend our leadership in the broader application delivery infrastructure market by adding key enabling technologies that make the end to end computing environment more flexible  dynamic and responsive to business change 
we may not realize any of these benefits 
in addition  we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of xensource as rapidly as  or to the extent  anticipated by our management and certain financial or industry analysts  and others may not perceive the same benefits of the acquisition as we do 
for example  xensource s contribution to our financial results may not meet the current expectations of our management for a number of reasons  including the integration risks described above  and could dilute our profits beyond the current expectations of our management 
operations and costs incurred and potential liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisition of xensource also could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
if these risks materialize  our stock price could be materially adversely affected 
although we currently expect to close the xensource acquisition in the fourth quarter of  our acquisition of xensource is subject to a number of closing conditions  including approval by the xensource stockholders and regulatory approvals 
if these closing conditions are not met  we may not be able to complete our acquisition of xensource 
if we determine that any of our goodwill or intangible assets  including technology purchased in acquisitions  are impaired  we would be required to take a charge to earnings  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets  such as product and core technology  related to our acquisitions 
we expect to record significant additional goodwill and other intangible asset amounts in connection with the acquisition of xensource when the acquisition is consummated 
we do not amortize goodwill and intangible assets that are deemed to have indefinite lives 
however  we do amortize certain product and core technologies  trademarks  patents and other intangibles 
we periodically evaluate our intangible assets  including goodwill  for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment 
as of december  we had million of goodwill 
we review for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current business model 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy and product portfolio  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill and other intangible assets could change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  impairment testing requires significant judgment  including the identification of reporting units based on our internal reporting structure that reflects the way we manage our business and operations and to which our goodwill and intangible assets would be assigned 
significant judgments are required to estimate the fair value of our goodwill and intangible assets  including estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates  estimating the applicable tax rates  foreign exchange rates and interest rates  projecting the future industry trends and market conditions  and making other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions  including changes in our reporting structure  could materially affect our determinations of fair value 
we recorded approximately million of goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions and our acquisitions 
if the actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired intangible assets are less than the projections we used to initially value these intangible assets when we acquired them  then these intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired 
if we determine that any of the goodwill or other intangible assets associated with our recent acquisitions are impaired  then we would be required to reduce the value of those assets or to write them off completely by taking a related charge to earnings 
if we are required to write down or write off all or a portion of those assets  or if financial analysts or investors believe we may need to take such action in the future  our stock price and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
at december   we had million  net  of unamortized identified intangibles  which include core and product technology we purchased in acquisitions or under third party licenses 
we currently market the technologies acquired in our acquisitions through our citrix online division products  application networking products  advanced solutions products and management systems products 
however  our channel distributors and entities with which we have technology relationships  customers or prospective customers may not purchase or widely accept our new appliances and continue to accept our citrix online division products 
if we fail to complete the development of our anticipated future product and service offerings  including product offerings acquired through our acquisitions  if we fail to complete them in a timely manner  or if we are unsuccessful in selling any new lines of products  appliances and services  we could determine that the value of the purchased technology is impaired in whole or in part and take a charge to earnings 
we could also incur additional charges in later periods to reflect costs associated with completing those projects that could not be completed in a timely manner 
an impairment charge could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if the actual revenues and operating profit attributable to acquired product and core technologies are less than the projections we used to initially value product and core technologies when we acquired it  such intangible assets may be deemed to be impaired 
if we determine that any of our intangible assets are impaired  we would be required to take a related charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
our business could be adversely impacted by conditions affecting the information technology market 
the demand for our products and services depends substantially upon the general demand for business related computer appliances and software  which fluctuates based on numerous factors  including capital spending levels  the spending levels and growth of our current and prospective customers and general economic conditions 
fluctuations in the demand for our products and services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in the past  adverse 
table of contents economic conditions decreased demand for our products and negatively impacted our financial results 
future economic projections for the information technology sector are uncertain 
if an uncertain information technology spending environment persists  it could negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to expand and diversify our distribution channels 
we currently intend to continue to expand our distribution channels by leveraging our relationships with independent hardware and software vendors and system integrators to encourage them to recommend or distribute our products 
in addition  an integral part of our strategy is to diversify our base of channel relationships by adding more channel members with abilities to reach larger enterprise customers and to sell our newer products 
this will require additional resources  as we will need to expand our internal sales and service coverage of these customers 
if we fail in these efforts and cannot expand or diversify our distribution channels  our business could be adversely affected 
in addition to this diversification of our base  we will need to maintain a healthy mix of channel members who cater to smaller customers 
we may need to add and remove distribution members to maintain customer satisfaction and a steady adoption rate of our products  which could increase our operating expenses 
through our accesspartner network  citrix authorized learning centers and other programs  we are currently investing  and intend to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these channels  which could reduce our profits 
we could change our licensing programs or subscription renewal programs  which could negatively impact the timing of our recognition of revenue 
we continually re evaluate our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs  including specific license models  delivery methods  and terms and conditions  to market our current and future products and services 
we could implement new licensing programs and subscription renewal programs  including offering specified and unspecified enhancements to our current and future product and service lines 
such changes could result in recognizing revenues over the contract term as opposed to upon the initial shipment or licensing of our software product 
we could implement different licensing models in certain circumstances  for which we would recognize licensing fees over a longer period 
changes to our licensing programs and subscription renewal programs  including the timing of the release of enhancements  upgrades  and maintenance releases  the term of the contract  discounts and other factors  could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products  related enhancements and services and could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
sales of our subscription advantage product constitute substantially all of our license updates revenue and a large portion of our deferred revenue 
we anticipate that sales of our subscription advantage product will continue to constitute a substantial portion of our license updates revenue 
our ability to continue to generate both recognized and deferred revenue from our subscription advantage product will depend on our customers continuing to perceive value in automatic delivery of our software upgrades and enhancements 
a decrease in demand for our subscription advantage product could occur as a result of a decrease in demand for our application virtualization  application networking and management systems products 
if our customers do not continue to purchase our subscription advantage product  our license updates revenue and deferred revenue would decrease significantly and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
as our international sales and operations grow  we could become increasingly subject to additional risks that could harm our business 
we conduct significant sales and customer support  development and engineering operations in countries outside of the united states including  as a result of our acquisition of netscaler  product development in bangalore  india 
during the twelve months ended december   we derived approximately of our revenues from sales outside the united states 
our continued growth and profitability could require us to further expand our international operations 
to successfully expand international sales  we must establish additional foreign operations  hire additional personnel and recruit additional international resellers 
our international operations are subject to a variety of risks  which could cause fluctuations in the results of our international operations 
these risks include compliance with foreign regulatory and market requirements  variability of foreign economic  political and labor conditions  changing restrictions imposed by regulatory requirements  tariffs or other trade barriers or by united states export laws  longer accounts receivable payment cycles  
table of contents potentially adverse tax consequences  difficulties in protecting intellectual property  burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and as we generate cash flow in non us jurisdictions  if required  we may experience difficulty transferring such funds to the us in a tax efficient manner 
our results of operations are also subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
in order to minimize the impact on our operating results  we generally initiate our hedging of currency exchange risks one year in advance of anticipated foreign currency expenses 
when the dollar is weak foreign currency denominated expenses will be higher 
as a result of our hedging practice these higher expenses will be partially offset by the gain in our hedging contracts 
if the dollar is strong  foreign currency denominated expenses will be lower 
these lower expenses will in turn be partially offset by the loss in our hedging contracts 
there is a risk that there will be fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates beyond the one year timeframe for which we hedge our risk 
in our operating expenses were generally lower due to a stronger dollar compared to during which our operating expenses were higher due to the dollar being generally weaker 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to anticipate and address these risks 
we cannot guarantee that these or other factors will not adversely affect our business or operating results 
our proprietary rights could offer only limited protection 
our products  including products obtained through acquisitions  could infringe third party intellectual property rights  which could result in material costs 
our efforts to protect our proprietary rights may not be successful 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions  to protect our proprietary rights 
the loss of any material trade secret  trademark  tradename  patent or copyright could have a material adverse effect on our business 
despite our precautions  it could be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy or reverse engineer certain portions of our products or to otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information 
if we cannot protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use  we may not remain competitive 
any patents owned by us could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
any of our pending or future patent applications  whether or not being currently challenged  may not be issued with the scope we seek  if at all  and if issued  may not provide any meaningful protection or competitive advantage 
in addition  our ability to protect our proprietary rights could be affected by differences in international law  enforceability of licenses 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our intellectual property to the same extent as do the laws of the united states and canada 
for example  we derive a significant portion of our sales from licensing our packaged products under shrink wrap or click to accept license agreements that are not signed by licensees and electronic enterprise customer licensing arrangements that are delivered electronically  all of which could be unenforceable under the laws of many foreign jurisdictions in which we license our products 
third party infringement claims 
we may become increasingly subject to infringement claims and claims alleging the unauthorized use of a third party s code in our products 
this may occur for a variety of reasons  including the expansion of our product lines  such as our application networking products  our citrix online division products  through product development and acquisitions  including our acquisition of xensource  and the increase in the number of competitors in our industry segments and the resulting increase in the number of related products and the overlap in the functionality of those products 
companies and inventors are more frequently seeking to patent software and business methods because of developments in the law that could extend the ability to obtain such patents 
as a result  we could receive more patent infringement claims 
responding to any infringement claim  regardless of its validity  could result in costly litigation  injunctive relief or require us to obtain a license to intellectual property rights of those third parties 
licenses may not be available on reasonable terms  on terms compatible with the protection of our proprietary rights  or at all 
in addition  attention to these claims could divert our management s time and attention from developing our business 
if a successful claim is made against us and we fail to develop or license a substitute technology  our business  results of operations  financial condition or cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we are subject to risks associated with our strategic and technology relationships 
our business depends on strategic and technology relationships 
we cannot assure you that those relationships will continue in the future 
in addition to our relationship with microsoft  we rely on strategic or technology relationships with such companies as dell inc  hewlett packard company  international business machines corporation  sap and others 
we depend on the entities with which we have strategic or technology relationships to successfully test our products  to incorporate our technology into their 
table of contents products and to market and sell those products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain our current strategic and technology relationships or to develop additional strategic and technology relationships 
if any entities in which we have a strategic or technology relationship are unable to incorporate our technology into their products or to market or sell those products  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if we lose access to third party licenses  releases of our products could be delayed 
we believe that we will continue to rely  in part  on third party licenses to enhance and differentiate our products 
third party licensing arrangements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties  including undetected errors or unauthorized use of another person s code in the third party s software  disagreement over the scope of the license and other key terms  such as royalties payable  infringement actions brought by third party licensees  and termination or expiration of the license 
if we lose or are unable to maintain any of these third party licenses or are required to modify software obtained under third party licenses  it could delay the release of our products 
any delays could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to attract and retain and further penetrate large enterprise customers 
we must retain and continue to expand our ability to reach and penetrate large enterprise customers by adding effective channel distributors and expanding our consulting services 
our inability to attract and retain large enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
large enterprise customers usually request special pricing and generally have longer sales cycles  which could negatively impact our revenues 
by granting special pricing  such as bundled pricing or discounts  to these large customers  we may have to defer recognition of some or all of the revenue from such sales 
this deferral could reduce our revenues and operating profits for a given reporting period 
additionally  as we attempt to attract and penetrate large enterprise customers  we may need to increase corporate branding and marketing activities  which could increase our operating expenses 
these efforts may not proportionally increase our operating revenues and could reduce our profits 
our success may depend on our ability to attract and retain small sized customers 
in order to successfully attract new customer segments to our presentation server products and expand our existing relationships with enterprise customers  we must reach and retain small sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger enterprise customers 
we have begun a marketing initiative to reach these customers that includes extending our advisor rewards program to include a broader range of license types 
in  we also introduced a new product  access essentials tm  specifically developed  packaged and priced to bring secure application virtualization and efficient centralized management of information resources to small and mid sized businesses 
we cannot guarantee that our small sized customer marketing initiative or new product will be successful 
our failure to attract and retain small sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger enterprise customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
additionally  as we attempt to attract and retain small sized customers and small project initiatives within our larger enterprise customers  we may need to increase corporate branding and broaden our marketing activities  which could increase our operating expenses 
these efforts may not proportionally increase our operating revenues and could reduce our profits 
we rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that we do not control 
we rely significantly on independent distributors and resellers to market and distribute our products and appliances 
we do not control our distributors and resellers 
additionally  our distributors and resellers are not obligated to buy our products and could also represent other lines of products 
some of our distributors and resellers maintain inventories of our packaged products for resale to smaller end users 
if distributors and resellers reduce their inventory of our packaged products  our business could be adversely affected 
further  we could maintain individually significant accounts receivable balances with certain distributors 
the financial condition of our distributors could deteriorate and distributors could significantly delay or default on their payment obligations 
any significant delays  defaults or terminations could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents for certain of our products we rely on third party suppliers and contract manufacturers  making us vulnerable to supply problems and price fluctuations 
we rely on a number of third party suppliers who provide hardware or the components thereof  many of which are sole source suppliers 
for example  all of the production  final test  warehousing and shipping for our application networking products  including our netscaler products  access gateway products and wanscaler products are primarily performed by a third party contract manufacturer 
we do not typically have long term supply agreements with our suppliers  and  in most cases  we purchase the products and components on an as needed purchase order basis 
in some instances  such as with respect to our application networking products  we maintain internal manufacturing capabilities to supplement third party contract manufacturers and provide us with the flexibility needed to meet our product delivery requirements on sales orders on a limited basis 
while we have not  to date  experienced any material difficulties or delays in the manufacture and assembly of our products  our suppliers may encounter problems during manufacturing due to a variety of reasons  including failure to follow specific protocols and procedures  failure to comply with applicable regulations  equipment malfunction and environmental factors  any of which could delay or impede their ability to meet our demand 
our reliance on these third party suppliers and contract manufacturers subjects us to risks that could harm our business  including we may have difficulty locating and qualifying alternative suppliers for our sole source supplies  our suppliers  especially new suppliers  may make errors in manufacturing components that could negatively affect the efficacy of our products or cause delays in shipment  our suppliers manufacture products for a range of customers  and fluctuations in demand for the products these suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability to deliver components and products to us in a timely manner  and our suppliers may encounter financial hardships unrelated to our demand for components  which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements 
there may be delay associated with establishing additional or replacement suppliers  particularly for components that are available only from sole or limited sources 
any interruption or delay in the supply of products or components  or our inability to obtain products or components from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner  could impair our ability to meet the demand of our customers and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our products could contain errors that could delay the release of new products and may not be detected until after our products are shipped 
despite significant testing by us and by current and potential customers  our products  especially new products or releases or acquired products  could contain errors 
in some cases  these errors may not be discovered until after commercial shipments have been made 
errors in our products could delay the development or release of new products and could adversely affect market acceptance of our products 
additionally  our products depend on third party products  which could contain defects and could reduce the performance of our products or render them useless 
because our products are often used in mission critical applications  errors in our products or the products of third parties upon which our products rely could give rise to warranty or other claims by our customers 
our synthetic lease is an off balance sheet arrangement that could negatively affect our financial condition and results 
in april  we entered into a seven year synthetic lease with a lessor for our headquarters office buildings in fort lauderdale  florida 
the synthetic lease qualifies for operating lease accounting treatment under sfas no 
 accounting for leases  so we do not include the property or the associated lease debt on our consolidated balance sheet 
however  if the lessor were to change its ownership of our property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds  under fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities revised we could be required to consolidate the entity  the leased facility and the debt at that time 
if we elect not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a minimum residual value of approximately million to the lessor 
therefore  if the fair value of the property declines below million  our residual value guarantee would require us to pay the difference to the lessor  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our synthetic lease contains a number of affirmative and negative covenants 
because of delays in filing our annual report on form k for the year ended december   our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended march  and our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended june   we were at risk of breaching the affirmative covenants requiring our annual report on form k for the year ended december  to be provided to the lessor within days after the end of our fiscal year and our quarterly reports on form q within days after the end of our fiscal quarters  
table of contents respectively 
we received waivers related to these anticipated covenant breaches to extend the due date of this annual report on form k for the year ended december   our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended march  and our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended june  until october  we have notified our lessor that we will provide such reports to the lessor by the extension date 
we have entered into credit facility agreements that restrict our ability to conduct our business and failure to comply with such agreements may have an adverse effect on our business  liquidity and financial position 
we and our subsidiary  citrix systems international gmbh  maintain a credit facility agreement that contains financial covenants tied to maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage  among other things 
the credit facility agreement also contains affirmative and negative covenants  including limitations related to our ability to incur future indebtedness  contingent obligations or liens  conduct certain mergers or acquisitions  make certain investments and loans  alter our capital structure  sell stock or assets and pay dividends 
if we fail to comply with these covenants or any other provision of the credit facility agreement  we may be in default under the credit facility agreement  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the necessary amendments or waivers of such default 
upon an event of default under our credit facility agreement not otherwise amended or waived  the affected lenders could accelerate the repayment of any outstanding principal and accrued interest on their outstanding loans and terminate their commitments to lend additional funds  which may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial position 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under our credit facility agreement 
our credit facility agreement contains a number of affirmative and negative covenants 
because of delays in filing our annual report on form k for the year ended december   our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended march  and our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended june   we were at risk of breaching the affirmative covenants requiring certain financial statements to be provided to our lenders within days after the end of our fiscal year and days after the end of our fiscal quarters 
we received waivers related to these covenant breaches to extend the due date of such financial statements until september  we have notified our lenders that we will provide such financial statements by the extension date 
if our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our citrix online division customers data  our services may be perceived as not being secure and customers may curtail or stop using our service 
use of our gotomypc  gotomeeting  gotoassist or gotowebinar services involves the storage and transmission of customers proprietary information and security breaches could expose us to a risk of loss of this information  litigation and possible liability 
if our security measures are breached as a result of third party action  employee error  malfeasance or otherwise and  as a result  someone obtains unauthorized access to one of our online customers data  our reputation will be damaged  our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability 
because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures 
if any compromises of security were to occur  it could have the effect of substantially reducing the use of the web for commerce and communications 
anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services or operations 
the internet is a public network and data are sent over this network from many sources 
in the past  computer viruses  software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet 
computer viruses could be introduced into our systems or those of our customers or suppliers  which could disrupt our network or make it inaccessible to our citrix online division customers 
if an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs  the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed and we could lose sales and customers for our citrix online division  which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our citrix online division 
evolving regulation of the web may adversely affect our citrix online division 
as web commerce continues to evolve  increasing regulation by federal  state or foreign agencies becomes more likely 
for example  we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy  and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation  collection  processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our online customers ability to use and share data and restricting our ability to store  process and share data with these customers 
in addition  taxation of services provided over the web or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the web may also be imposed 
any regulation imposing greater fees for web use or restricting information exchange over the web could result in a decline in the use of the web and the viability of web based services  which would significantly adversely affect our financial condition and the operating results for our citrix online division 

table of contents natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes that result in a disruption of our operations could negatively impact our results of operations 
our worldwide operations are dependent on our network infrastructure  internal technology systems and website 
significant portions of our computer equipment  intellectual property resources and personnel  including critical resources dedicated to research and development and administrative support functions are presently located at our corporate headquarters in fort lauderdale  florida  an area of the country that is particularly prone to hurricanes  and at our various locations in california  an area of the country that is particularly prone to earthquakes 
we also have operations in various domestic and international locations that expose us to additional diverse risks 
the occurrence of natural disasters  such as hurricanes or earthquakes  or other unanticipated catastrophes  such as telecommunications failures  cyber attacks  fires or terrorist attacks  at any of the locations in which we do business  could cause interruptions in our operations 
for example  in october  hurricane wilma passed through southern florida causing extensive damage to the region  including some minor damage to our corporate headquarters facility 
in addition  even in the absence of direct damage to our operations  large disasters  terrorist attacks or other casualty events could have a significant impact on our partners and customers businesses  which in turn could result in a negative impact on our results of operations 
extensive or multiple disruptions in our operations  or our partners or customers businesses  due to natural disasters or other unanticipated catastrophes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
if we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future  we may not be able to fund our product development and acquisitions and fulfill our future obligations 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to fund our operations and product development  including the payment of cash consideration in acquisitions and the payment of our other obligations  depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations  or that we will be able to liquidate our investments  repatriate cash and investments held in our overseas subsidiaries  sell assets or raise equity or debt financings when needed or desirable 
an inability to fund our operations or fulfill outstanding obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for further information  please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
if stock balancing returns or price adjustments exceed our reserves  our operating results could be adversely affected 
we provide most of our distributors with stock balancing return rights  which generally permit our distributors to return products to us by the forty fifth day of a fiscal quarter  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter 
we also provide price protection rights to most of our distributors 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors if we lower our prices for those products within a specified time period 
to cover our exposure to these product returns and price adjustments  we establish reserves based on our evaluation of historical product trends and current marketing plans 
however  we cannot assure you that our reserves will be sufficient to cover our future product returns and price adjustments 
if we inadequately forecast reserves  our operating results could be adversely affected 
our stock price could be volatile  and you could lose the value of your investment 
our stock price has been volatile and has fluctuated significantly in the past 
the trading price of our stock is likely to continue to be volatile and subject to fluctuations in the future 
your investment in our stock could lose some or all of its value 
some of the factors that could significantly affect the market price of our stock include actual or anticipated variations in operating and financial results  analyst reports or recommendations  changes in interest rates  and other events or factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the stock market in general  the nasdaq global select market formerly  the nasdaq national market  and the market for software companies and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market and industry factors could materially and adversely affect the market price of our stock  regardless of our actual operating performance 

table of contents changes or modifications in financial accounting standards related to share based compensation may have a material adverse impact on our reported results of operations 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  a complex accounting standard that requires companies to expense the fair value of employee stock options and similar awards 
as a result of adopting the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  our income before taxes and net income for are million and million lower  respectively  than if we had continued to account for stock based compensation under apb opinion no 
the application of sfas no 
r requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding stock price volatility  option forfeiture rates and expected option lives  to build a model for appropriately valuing share based compensation 
there is little experience or guidance with respect to developing these assumptions and models 
there is a risk that  as we and others gain experience with sfas no 
r or as a result of subsequent accounting guidelines  we could determine that the assumptions or model we used requires modification 
any such modification could result in significantly different charges in future periods and  potentially  could require us to correct the charges taken in prior periods 
these modifications  as well as any such corrections of charges taken in a prior period could negatively affect our results of operations  stock price and our stock price volatility 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  our net revenues have fluctuated quarterly and have generally been the highest in the fourth quarter of our fiscal year due to corporate calendar year end spending trends 
in addition  our european operations generally provide lower revenues in the summer months because of the generally reduced level of economic activity in europe during the summer 
this seasonal factor also typically results in higher fourth quarter revenues 
quarterly results are also affected by the timing of the release of new products and services 
because of the seasonality of our business  results for any quarter  especially our fourth quarter  are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year 
our business and investments could be adversely impacted by unfavorable economic political and social conditions 
general economic and market conditions  and other factors outside our control including significant natural disasters  terrorist attacks or military actions  could adversely affect our business and impair the value of our investments 
any downturn in general economic conditions could result in a reduction in demand for our products and services and could harm our business 
these conditions make it difficult for us  and our customers  to accurately forecast and plan future business activities and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  an economic downturn could result in an impairment in the value of our investments requiring us to record losses related to such investments 
impairment in the value of these investments may disrupt our ongoing business and distract management 
as of december  we had million of short and long term investments  including restricted investments  with various issuers and financial institutions 
in many cases we do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these investments and could incur losses related to the impairment of these investments 
fluctuations in economic and market conditions could adversely affect the value of our investments  and we could lose some of our investment portfolio 
a total loss of an investment could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
for further information on these investments  please refer to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources

in january  a similar suit naming citrix systems  inc was filed in the united states district court of the eastern district of texas  and we have filed a response denying infringement and alleging that the asserted patent is invalid 
on november   the court in the northern district of ohio held a hearing for the purpose of construing disputed terms of the claims of the patent in suit  and on march   the court issued a claim construction ruling

to correct these errors  we have recorded a pre tax cumulative charge of million million on an after tax basis in our consolidated financial statements through december  to reflect additional stock based compensation expense 
background on november   after our management conducted a preliminary  limited scope review of certain of our stock option granting practices  our audit committee commenced a voluntary  independent investigation of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting during the period from january through december none of the members of our audit committee has ever served on the compensation committee of the board of directors 
this voluntary investigation was not in response to any governmental investigation  stockholder lawsuit  whistleblower complaint  or inquiries from media organizations 
the investigation was conducted with the assistance of independent outside legal counsel and outside forensic accounting consultants  and covered option grants made to all employees during the period from january through december management further evaluated all grants consisting of two employee new hire grants in december  which was the month we completed our initial public offering  and all grants to non employee directors 
the investigation and related review consisted of approximately grant dates representing over  individual option grants and approximately million stock options 
in connection with its investigation  the audit committee retained independent outside legal counsel that had not previously been engaged by us  to assist in the investigation 
in turn  legal counsel retained outside forensic accounting experts and other consultants to assist it and the audit committee with financial accounting issues and related analytics during the investigation 
the investigation occurred over a period of approximately seven months 
the investigative work conducted by the audit committee included the following tasks  among others reviewing hard copy and electronic files obtained from us as well as other sources  totaling approximately  pages of hard copy documents and approximately  electronic documents  typically consisting of multiple pages each  conducting more than interviews with present and former directors who have served on the compensation committee during the relevant period  present and former members of senior management  other present and former employees  and former outside professionals who had provided legal services to us during the period of the investigation  in connection with its investigation  the members of our audit committee met both telephonically and in person numerous times and the chairman of the audit committee communicated with the audit committee s counsel on a frequent basis  and engaging outside consultants to conduct various analyses of our option grants

r 
as permitted by the terms of our various stock plans as amended and restated from time to time  the compensation committee of our board of directors was vested with the authority to administer and grant stock options under the plans 
until november  all employee stock option grants were required to be approved by the compensation committee 
beginning in november and continuing to the present  the compensation committee delegated authority  subject to specific parameters  to our chief executive officer and our chief financial officer to grant options to non executive employees 
grants to section officers  to employees whose compensation was subject to section m of the of the internal revenue code of  as amended  or the irc  and other grants outside of the parameters discussed below continued to require compensation committee approval in order to complete the required granting actions 
in the restatement  for grants requiring compensation committee approval  we generally determined that compensation committee approval was likely obtained at the next in person meeting after the date of grant 
this conclusion was based on the fact that compensation committee members recall signing consents in person at board meetings  that members of management recalled that it was our objective to present consents to the committee at in person meetings  that the consents contained in our records typically contain all signatures on a single page consistent with having been signed in person  and that the available meta data for such consents generally indicated that the consent forms were available for signature at that time 
we generally used the in person board meeting dates when determining revised measurement dates  because members of management responsible for approval and processing of these grants believed or acted as if approval was an important and required granting action for all grants that were not subject to the delegation of authority described below 
for example  managers involved in processing grants i said that they typically refrained from correcting grants approved by the committee without further committee action  but ii believed that alteration or correction of grant recipient and amount lists prior to committee approval was permitted and performed such corrections and alterations and did not consider them to be modifications  and iii believed committee approval was necessary to grant options 
there was some evidence that signatures were sometimes solicited at such meetings for consents previously signed and transmitted by fax or other means but because we did not retain these earlier obtained consents there was little evidence to indicate for which grants these approvals were obtained and when they were received 
where meta data or other evidence led us to conclude that approval was not complete at the next in person meeting  we relied on the other evidence to select a later date 
from december through december  the exercise price for all grants was typically set at the closing price of our common stock on the original intended grant date 
during this period  we made the following types of grants of stock options to employees  including officers  and members of our board of directors annual grants in conjunction with our annual merit review process  which generally occurred a few months following our fiscal year end referred to as annual grants 
non annual grants to newly hired and promoted employees and from time to time to officers in recognition of performance or as incentives 
beginning january  we replaced promotion grants with performance grants that were granted to employees upon recommendation by their manager for recognition new hire and performance  incentive or promotion grants are referred to collectively as non annual grants 
options granted or assumed in connection with acquisitions 
options granted to non employee members of our board of directors 
from december through mid  all employee grants required approval by the compensation committee to complete the required granting actions 
in addition  we did not have a defined process for determining the date on which we made grants and no granting pattern could be established for grants made during this period 
following the investigation  the audit committee concluded that we likely set grant dates retrospectively for many stock options granted to employees and executives during the to mid period 
beginning in mid through late  all employee grants required approval by the compensation committee to complete the required granting actions 
during this period  we made changes in our stock option granting practices which included implementing a practice where we typically dated non annual grants to non executives on the first business day of the month following the start or promotion date  unless that date was the first day of the month  in which case the grant date would be that date 
we dated non annual new hire and promotion grants to executives either on their start date or the first business day of the month following the start date or the promotion date  we awarded the incentive grants on an ad hoc basis 
during this period  we made annual grants to executive and non executive employees on dates that were typically previously discussed with the compensation committee 
however  during these earlier discussions  the compensation committee did not approve the terms and allocation of 
table of contents grants to individual recipients or delegate to management the authority to do so without further action by the compensation committee 
until  annual grants were generally made in july or august of each year pursuant to a merit evaluation process 
beginning in  annual grants were split into two grant dates in march and august 
during this period all employee grants required approval by the compensation committee to complete the required granting actions and for most grants we did not obtain approval from the compensation committee  typically on unanimous written consent forms  until after the grant date and for certain grants  we had not completed the process of identifying the recipients or number of options to be granted until after the grant date 
beginning in november  the compensation committee delegated its authority to our chief executive officer and chief financial officer to issue stock options pursuant to specific parameters 
the delegation provided authority to grant no more than million stock options per year in the aggregate and to grant up to  options per year to any employee who was not an officer subject to section of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and whose compensation was not subject to section m of the internal revenue code of as amended  or the irc 
in july the compensation committee increased that number to  options per employee per year 
the delegation was also subject to other parameters  including that each grant be consistent in number with guidelines that provided the range of grants that could be awarded to each employee grade 
compensation committee approval continued to be a required granting action for all stock option grants outside of the parameters of the delegated authority 
for grants outside of the delegation of authority  the compensation committee often approved such grants at a meeting or by unanimous written consent form 
in some cases the amount granted to each recipient was not final and or the compensation committee had not approved the grants by the intended grant date 
we also made grants to the employees of companies we acquired in connection with acquisitions 
grants made in conjunction with acquisitions were typically authorized at the time of the board s approval of the acquisition 
the exercise price of such grants was typically set at the closing stock price of our common stock on the closing date of the acquisition 
during the investigation  we noted one grant date where the grant was approved by our board of directors in conjunction with the acquisition  however  we had not completed the required granting actions by the stated grant date and the measurement date was revised to the date that the evidence indicated that we completed our allocation 
we also grant options to the non employee members of our board of directors  or the board grants  pursuant to a stockholder approved plan  as amended from time to time 
the timing of the grant date and amount of such awards was granted pre determined pursuant to a formula set forth either in the terms of the plan or via board resolution 
certain board grants were issued on a date other than the automatic grant date prescribed by the plan or differed by nominal amounts from the option amount pre determined by the plan formula 
prior to the restatement discussed below  we used the grant dates as set forth above as the measurement date for financial accounting purposes 
accordingly  in each case the exercise price did not exceed the closing stock price of our common stock on that date  and we did not record stock based compensation expense in connection with these grants 
in the restatement  we revised the measurement dates for many grants and recorded stock based compensation expense when the revised measurement date resulted in intrinsic value which we accounted for in the restatement 
adjustments to measurement dates arising from errors identified by audit committee investigation based on the facts obtained as a result of the audit committee s investigation  we identified certain grants for which we used an incorrect measurement date for financial accounting purposes  as defined under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  or gaap 
to determine the correct measurement dates for these grants under applicable accounting principles  we followed the guidance in apb no 
 which deems the measurement date to be the first date on which all of the following are known with finality the identity of the individual employee who is entitled to receive the option grant  the number of options that the individual employee is entitled to receive  and the option s exercise price 
we completed a grant date by grant date analysis of approximately option grant dates during the relevant period for compliance with apb no 
each individual grant on each grant date was evaluated based on its particular facts and circumstances 
where we determined that we did not complete the required granting actions by the original grant date  we used judgment to determine corrected measurement dates consistent with what the evidence suggested was our practice or process or other information obtained as part of the investigation that suggested the date upon which all requirements for a measurement date had been satisfied under applicable accounting principles 
if the measurement date was not the same date we used previously  we made accounting adjustments as required  which resulted in stock based compensation and related tax effects when an option had intrinsic value on the revised measurement date 
the documents and information considered in connection with the measurement date adjustments that we have made included  but was not limited to minutes of board of directors and compensation committee meetings and related presentations  unanimous written consents signed by the compensation committee members  and evidence relating to the date such consents were created and circulated for signature and or signed  
table of contents information contained in personnel files maintained for employees who were granted options  electronic mail messages and other electronic files retrieved from our computer system and in back up media  documentation prepared in connection with our annual performance reviews of employees as part of the process of determining the allocation of stock option grants to individual employees  information as to the date of hire of the employee receiving the option grant  including if the grant was a new hire grant the date of any offer letter  correspondence  memoranda and other documentation supporting the option grant  information concerning the date or dates on which a stock option was entered into our stock option tracking system  equity edge  information obtained during interviews conducted by the audit committee s outside counsel of numerous individuals  including current and former officers  directors  employees and outside professionals  and analyses of our option grant performed by consultants engaged on behalf of the audit committee 
consistent with current accounting literature and published guidance from the staff of the sec  we classified grants during the eleven year period subject to the investigation into categories based on grant type and process by which the grant was finalized 
the principal categories related to annual and non annual grants in three time periods january through may  may through november  and november through december we also separately categorized grants to non employee directors 
the last grant with a revised measurement date was awarded in march there were no revised measurement dates in a summary of pre tax stock based compensation expense related to options awarded in each time period  in thousands  is as follows time period pre tax stock based compensation expense january through may includes two grants made in december may through november november through december cumulative effect at december  january may in the restatement  we corrected the measurement dates for all original grants dates during this period  consisting of approximately million options 
we also revised measurement dates for all grants consisting of two employee new hire grants in december  which was the month we completed our initial public offering 
after completion of its investigation  the audit committee concluded that we likely selected grant dates retrospective for many stock options granted to employees and executives during the january through may period 
in addition  the required granting actions for many of these grants were not completed on the original measurement date 
during this period  a substantial majority of the grants were approved using unanimous written consent forms signed by the compensation committee for which  in most cases  there was no documentary evidence of when approval was obtained 
as discussed above  for grants where there was insufficient evidence to determine when approval was obtained  we generally used the date of the first in person board of directors meeting after the evidence suggested that the amount and terms of the grant were final as the revised measurement date for financial accounting purposes 
where evidence existed of advance approval by the compensation committee such as facsimile header dates on signed unanimous written consent forms  we used this information as evidence of when the compensation committee approval was obtained  and used that date as the revised measurement date for financial accounting purposes 
may november during this period we issued approximately million options over grant dates 
in the restatement  we corrected measurement dates for approximately million options granted on of the grants dates 
we made these corrections because we did not complete the required granting actions by the original grant date  including  obtaining approvals from the compensation committee and not finalizing the amounts or recipients as of the original grant date 

table of contents during this period  a substantial majority of the grants were approved using unanimous written consent forms signed by the compensation committee for which  in most cases  there was no documentary evidence of when approval was actually obtained 
as discussed above  where there was insufficient evidence to determine when approval conclusively was obtained  we generally used the date of the first in person board of directors meeting after the evidence suggested that the amount and terms of the grant were final as determined by management as the revised measurement date for financial accounting purposes 
however  if there was evidence sufficient for us to conclude that the required granting actions were completed on a date that was earlier than the next in person board meeting  in accordance with apb no 
 we set the revised measurement date at the earlier date 
november december beginning in november  we granted million options to employees on grant dates pursuant to delegated authority described above 
in virtually all cases these grants were made on predetermined annual grant dates or the first business day of the month following the employee s hire date or performance recognition and were issued pursuant to an underlying system of processes  controls and management approvals 
after the award was communicated to the employee and the administrative processes were complete the cfo signed an internal delegation of authority form after the grant date 
we concluded that the cfo s signature on these documents was perfunctory and was not a required granting action 
during this period  approximately of the individual non executive employee grants or of the total non executive employee options awarded pursuant to the delegation process exceeded the delegation limitations discussed above and should have been presented for approval by the compensation committee 
although these grants were not approved by the compensation committee  they were communicated to employees and processed pursuant to the same system of processes  controls and management approvals as grants within the limitations 
we have concluded that these grants were legally outstanding and that the requirements to establish a measurement date were met on the original grant date 
we revised the measurement date for the non executive annual grant originally dated april  the grant was issued pursuant to the delegation of authority above and was revised because we had not completed the process of determining grant amounts and recipients until after the grant date 
we determined revised measurement dates for each individual recipient through may  by assessing when each grant was fixed with finality as reflected in hard copy and electronic documents and other information 
this was the only grant date that options issued under delegated authority were revised and we recognized total pre tax stock compensation expense of approximately million related to this grant 
compensation committee approval continued to be a required granting action for all stock option grants outside of the parameters of the delegated authority  as described above 
for grants outside of the delegation of authority  the compensation committee typically approved such grants at a meeting or by unanimous written consent form 
during this period  the compensation committee approved million options on grant dates 
we determined that for seven of these grant dates  the original grant date differed from the appropriate measurement date for financial accounting purposes 
we recorded approximately  in pre tax stock based compensation expense related to these grants 
the last grant for which we revised the measurement date was march  board grants 
from through  we made grants to non employee directors on grant dates for a total of million options 
we revised the measurement dates for certain of these grants because they were awarded on dates other than the automatic dates prescribed in the applicable stockholder plan and in amounts that differed nominally from the formulas set forth in the plan 
we recognized approximately million in pre tax stock based compensation expense related to the following grants we awarded to non employee directors an aggregate of million options on five grant dates between and instead of awarding these options on the anniversary date of the directors appointment to the board  they were awarded on the first day of the month containing the directors anniversary date  in error 
these options were issued between three and days in advance of the actual anniversary date 
we determined that the grants were not fixed with finality until the anniversary date prescribed by the plan because that date represents the date on which approval existed pursuant to the stockholder approved plan 
we revised the measurement dates accordingly  and recognized pre tax compensation expense of million representing the difference in intrinsic value between grant date prescribed by the plan and the original grant date 
we awarded approximately million options in june to non employee directors 
the grant was one day later than the automatic date prescribed by the stockholder approved plan and the number of options were nominally different from the plan formula aggregate difference of options 
based on the available evidence  we concluded that the grant date error constituted a modification of the automatic grant that should have occurred on the previous day 
we concluded that the grant was fixed with finality on the date awarded and the dating error and share differences resulted in compensation expense of approximately  representing the difference in the intrinsic value between the automatic grant date prescribed by the plan and the original grant date 

table of contents in  we awarded an anniversary grant for approximately million options in error one year after the actual anniversary date of the director 
we considered the grant a modification of the prescribed automatic grant under the stockholder approved plan and concluded that the grant was fixed with finality on the grant date 
however  no compensation expense resulted as the closing price of our common stock increased from the automatic grant date to the grant date of the award 
other measurement date judgments we identified other circumstances related to approximately million options approximately of options issued that resulted in revised measurement dates 
in some instances  we made changes after the grant date to add individuals to the list of grant recipients and received later approval by the compensation committee 
in other instances  we issued options that were different in amount than that approved by the compensation committee or issued options for which we were unable to locate the approval documentation during the investigation 
in each of these circumstances  we evaluated the existing information related to each individual grant and we established a new measurement date when we determined that the terms of the award were fixed with finality 
impact of the errors on our financial statements we have determined that after accounting for forfeitures  the errors described above resulted in an understatement of stock based compensation expense over the vesting terms of the grants corrected 
most of the adjusted measurement dates were with respect to grants made prior to december  we recorded pre tax stock based compensation expense of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and million related to years prior to fiscal there was no impact on revenue or cash and investments as a result of this additional stock compensation expense and the adjustments related to our historical stock option granting practices 
as a result of the review  we determined that we failed to properly withhold employment the employee and our portions of fica and supplemental federal withholding taxes associated with certain stock option exercises 
we recorded such amounts in the consolidated statements of income in the period in which we were originally obligated to make the withholding 
additionally  for tax years where the statute of limitations has lapsed  we have recorded the reduction in previously recorded liabilities in the period the statute of limitations expires 
we have recorded approximately million  net of income tax  through december  for employment taxes and related charges 
additionally  we believe that united states income tax deductions taken for stock option exercises in prior years  which pertained to certain executives  may not be deductible under limitations imposed by irc section m 
section m limits the deductibility of compensation above million to certain executive officers of public companies when such compensation is not incentive based 
as a result  we have reduced our available tax net operating loss carry forwards arising from certain previously exercised stock options 
we restated our tax provisions in the periods in which the benefits were recorded 
the additional compensation expense in and reflected below primarily relates to the impact of vesting of awards granted prior to a summary of total charges  including estimated employment related tax charges  which are comprised of withholding taxes  penalties and interest  by fiscal period  in thousands  is as follows year ended december  pre tax expense employment related tax charges income taxes net charge to net income cumulative effect at december  total in addition  to the amounts reflected above  for the year ended december   we had previously recognized million in stock based compensation expense related to stock based awards 
accordingly  the total pre tax stock based compensation expense for was approximately million 
previously recorded stock based compensation expense  if any  for each of the years ended december  through december  was not material 
the total pre tax stock based compensation expense for the period from january  through december  was approximately million 

table of contents the following table reflects the impacts of the restatement adjustments on our consolidated statements of income for the periods presented below in thousands category of adjustments cumulative effect from january  through december  pre tax stock based compensation expense related to stock option measurement date changes other tax charges income tax impact on other tax charges income tax adjustments related to irc section m income tax impact related to stock option compensation expense date changes total income tax adjustments total charge to net income the cumulative effect of the restatement adjustments on the consolidated balance sheet at december  was an increase in additional paid in capital  offset by a corresponding decrease in retained earnings and deferred compensation  which results in no net effect on stockholders equity 
there were also adjustments made to increase our short and long term deferred tax assets and our accrued expenses due to the tax effects of the restatement 
the adjustments decreased previously reported basic net income per share by for the year ended december  and had no impact on previously reported basic net income per share for the year ended december  the adjustments had no impact on previously reported diluted net income per share for the years ended december  and judgment most of the revised measurement dates could not be determined with certainty  and we made judgments  as described above  to establish the revised dates 
judgments different from those used by us regarding the timing of the revised measurement dates would have resulted in different compensation expense charges than those recorded by us in the restatement 
we therefore prepared a sensitivity analysis to determine the hypothetical minimum and maximum compensation expense charge that could occur if different judgments to determine the revised measurement dates were used 
we provided a minimum and maximum range to the sensitivity analysis as a result of significant volatility in prices versus the revised measurement date prices 
in reviewing all available data  we considered other possible alternative grant dates for determining a sensitivity analysis  but were unable to find any such data or evidence that would provide an alternative we believed to be better than the one we selected 
we applied our sensitivity methodology on a grant date by grant date basis to examine the largest hypothetical variations in stock based compensation expense within a range of possible approval dates for each grant event 
we developed this range by generally using the date that the allocation and recipients were determined to be final as the earliest possible date and the revised measurement date as the end date 
in some cases  the earliest possible date was the original date of grant  while for others it was a date that the allocation and recipients were subsequently determined to have been completed based on documentary evidence  such as for example e mails  electronic and printed dating evidence on grant recommendation listings and the metadata creation dates on unanimous written consent forms 
in the few cases where there was some evidence suggesting the possibility that the grant had been approved after the revised measurement date  the end date was subsequent to the revised measurement date 
based on all available evidence  such as for example unanimous written consents  email dates  and board of director or committee meeting dates  we were unable to identify dates that would provide a more reasonable range of dates for this sensitivity analysis 
while we believe the evidence and methodology used to determine the revised measurement dates to be the most appropriate  we also believe that illustrating differences in stock based compensation expense using these alternative date ranges provides some insight into the extent to which hypothetical stock based compensation expense would have fluctuated if we chose other dates 
after developing the range for each grant event  we selected the highest closing price of our stock within the range and calculated the difference in stock based compensation expense to determine the maximum possible compensation expense 
we then selected the lowest closing price within the range and calculated the difference in stock based compensation expense to determine the minimum possible compensation expense 
if the low closing price was less than the closing price on the original date of grant  there was no resulting compensation charge 
we compared these aggregated amounts to the stock based compensation that we recorded 
if we had used the highest closing price of our stock within the range  our total restated stock based compensation adjustment relating to the revision in measurement dates would have been increased by approximately million 
conversely  had we used the lowest closing price of our stock within the range  our total restated compensation expense would have decreased by million 

table of contents our hypothetical ranges of stock based compensation expense were affected by the high level of volatility in our stock price and the date ranges used in our sensitivity analysis  generally the time period between the original grant dates of certain stock options and the revised measurement dates 
for example  in the year in our restatement period with the largest sensitivity range based on option grant date  our stock price closed at a low of per share and a high of per share during the range of potential alternative measurement dates 
in the year in our restatement period with the second largest sensitivity range based on option grant date  our stock price closed at a low of per share and a high of per share during the range of potential alternative measurement dates 
since we do not have evidence that the grant dates and exercise prices were selected on the date when our stock price was at its highest or lowest during each period  we concluded that selecting a revised measurement date on the highest or lowest closing price when measuring compensation expense would not have been consistent with the requirements of apb no 
 which looks to the first date on which the terms of the grants were fixed with finality 
the following tables set forth the effect on earnings before income taxes net of estimated forfeitures that would result from using different alternate measurement date determinations as compared to the measurement date selected in our evaluation and used for accounting purposes 
the first table  titled sensitivity analysis by option grant year illustrates actual pre tax stock based compensation expense and the hypothetical stock based compensation expense based on the year each option in the restatement was granted 
the second table  titled sensitivity analysis by option vest year illustrates the actual amortization of the pre tax stock based compensation recognized in our consolidated financial statements and the hypothetical stock based compensation expense in the period that the options are earned 
the difference in the total compensation set forth in each table is due to stock based compensation that will be expensed in future periods when earned

critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
we base these estimates on our historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and these estimates form the basis for our judgments concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we periodically evaluate these estimates and judgments based on available information and experience 
actual results could differ from our estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors and our independent auditors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also important to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition the accounting related to revenue recognition in the software industry is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
in addition  our judgment is required in assessing the probability of collection  which is generally based on evaluation of customer specific information  historical collection experience and economic market conditions 
if market conditions decline  or if the financial condition of our distributors or customers deteriorate  we may be unable to determine that collectibility is probable  and we could be required to defer the recognition of revenue until we receive customer payments 
we license most of our products bundled with a one year contract for license updates that provide the end user with free enhancements and upgrades to the licensed product on a when and if available basis 
customers may also elect to purchase subscriptions for license updates  when not bundled with the initial product release or purchase  technical support  product training or consulting services 
we allocate revenue to license updates and any other undelivered elements of the arrangement based on vendor specific objective evidence  or vsoe  of fair value of each element and such amounts are deferred until the applicable delivery criteria and other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the balance of the revenue  net of any discounts inherent in the arrangement  is recognized at the outset of the arrangement using the residual method as the product licenses are delivered 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of each undelivered element based on the vsoe fair value  we defer revenue recognition until all elements are delivered  all services have been performed  or until fair value can be objectively determined 
we must apply judgment in determining all elements of the arrangement and in determining the vsoe of fair value for each element  considering the price charged for each product or applicable renewal rates for license updates 
in the normal course of business  we do not permit product returns  but we do provide most of our distributors with stock balancing and price protection rights 
stock balancing rights permit distributors to return products to us up to the forty fifth day of the fiscal quarter  subject to ordering an equal dollar amount of our other products prior to the last day of the same fiscal quarter 
price protection rights require that we grant retroactive price adjustments for inventories of our products held by distributors or resellers if we lower our prices for such products 
we establish provisions for estimated returns for stock balancing and price protection rights  as 
table of contents well as other sales allowances  concurrently with the recognition of revenue 
the provisions are established based upon consideration of a variety of factors  including  among other things  recent and historical return rates for both specific products and distributors  estimated distributor inventory levels by product  the impact of any new product releases and projected economic conditions 
actual product returns for stock balancing and price protection provisions incurred are  however  dependent upon future events  including the amount of stock balancing activity by our distributors and the level of distributor inventories at the time of any price adjustments 
we continually monitor the factors that influence the pricing of our products and distributor inventory levels and make adjustments to these provisions when we believe actual returns and other allowances could differ from established reserves 
our ability to recognize revenue upon shipment to our distributors is predicated on our ability to reliably estimate future stock balancing returns 
if actual experience or changes in market condition impairs our ability to estimate returns  we would be required to defer the recognition of revenue until the delivery of the product to the end user 
allowances for estimated product returns amounted to approximately million at december  and million at december  we have not reduced and have no current plans to reduce our prices for inventory currently held by distributors or resellers 
accordingly  there were no reserves required for price protection at december  and december  we also record reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings including volume based incentives  at the time the sale is recorded 
if market conditions were to decline  we could take actions to increase our customer incentive offerings  which could result in an incremental reduction to our revenue at the time the incentive is offered 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment on january   the effective date for such adoption 
prior to january   we accounted for our stock based compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we did not recognize compensation cost related to stock options granted to our employees and non employee directors that had an exercise price equal to or above the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant in our consolidated statement of income prior to january  we elected to adopt sfas no 
r using the modified prospective method  under which compensation cost  based on the requirements of sfas no 
r  is recognized beginning with the effective date for all stock based awards granted to employees after the effective date and prior to the effective date that remain unvested as of the effective date 
in addition  under the modified prospective method prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares 
the determination of the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  the expected term of the award  the risk free interest rate and any expected dividends 
for purposes of determining the expected volatility factor  we considered the implied volatility in two year market traded options on our common stock based on third party volatility quotes in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
our decision to use implied volatility was based upon the availability of actively traded options on our common stock and our assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility 
the expected term of our options is based on historical and projected employee exercise patterns 
we also analyzed our historical pattern of option exercises based on certain demographic characteristics and we determined that there were no meaningful differences in option exercise activity based on the demographic characteristic 
the approximate risk free interest rate is based on the implied yield available on us treasury zero coupon issues with remaining terms equivalent to the expected term on our options 
we do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future and  accordingly  we used a dividend yield of zero in the option pricing model 
we are required to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures and record stock based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 
all stock based payment awards  including those with graded vesting schedules  are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are generally the vesting periods 
beginning in  we began issuing non vested stock units and non vested stock with performance goals to certain senior members of management 
the number of non vested stock units or non vested stock underlying each award may be determined based on a range of attainment within defined performance goals 
we are required to estimate the attainment that will be achieved related to the defined performance goals and number of non vested stock units or non vested stock that will ultimately be awarded in order to recognize compensation expense over the vesting period 
if our initial estimates of performance goal attainment change  the related expense may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on those estimates and if the performance goals are not met  
table of contents no compensation cost will be recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost will be reversed 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to options  non vested stock and non vested stock units 
that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions for estimating stock based compensation expense in future periods or if we decide to use a different valuation model  the stock based compensation expense we recognize in future periods may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period and could materially affect our operating income  net income and earnings per share 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
the black scholes option pricing model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
these characteristics are not present in our option grants and employee stock purchase plan shares 
existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our stock based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our stock based compensation awards on the grant dates may bear little resemblance to the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those stock based payments in the future 
certain stock based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire with little or no intrinsic value compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  the value realized from these instruments may be significantly higher than the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
the guidance in sfas no 
r and sab no 
is relatively new from an application perspective and the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time

for information regarding our audit committee s voluntary  independent review of our historical stock option granting practices and the related accounting see the explanatory note to this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  core and product technology assets we review acquired core and product technology assets for impairment on a periodic basis by comparing the estimated net realizable value to the unamortized cost of the technology 
we have acquired our core and product technology assets from our business combinations and other third party agreements 
the recoverability of these technologies is primarily dependent upon our ability to commercialize products utilizing these technologies 
the estimated net realizable value of the purchased technology is based on the estimated undiscounted future cash flows derived from such technology 
our assumptions about future revenues and expenses require significant judgment associated with the forecast of the performance of our products 
actual revenues and costs could vary significantly from these forecasted amounts 
as of december   the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from core and product technology assets from these acquisitions is sufficient to recover their carrying value 
if these products are not ultimately accepted by our customers and distributors  and there is no alternative future use for the technology  we could determine that some or all of their remaining million carrying value is impaired 
in the event of impairment  we would record an impairment charge to earnings that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
goodwill at december   we had million in goodwill primarily related to our acquisitions 
the goodwill recorded in relation to these acquisitions is not deductible for tax purposes 
we operate in a single industry segment consisting of the design  development and marketing of technology solutions that deliver applications on demand 
our revenues are derived from sales of our application delivery infrastructure products and related technical services in the americas  europe  the middle east and africa  or emea  and asia pacific regions and from online services sold by our citrix online division 
these three geographic regions and the citrix online division constitute our reportable segments 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  for additional information regarding our reportable segments 
we evaluate goodwill along these segments  which represent our reporting units 
substantially all of our goodwill at december  was associated with our americas and online services reportable segments 
excluding goodwill  we have no intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill for impairment 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment annually  or sooner if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount could exceed fair value 
fair values are based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate determined by our management to be consistent with industry discount rates and the risks inherent in our current 
table of contents business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we completed the required annual impairment tests of goodwill as of december  there were no impairment charges recorded as a result of our annual impairment tests 
due to uncertain market conditions and potential changes in our strategy  product portfolio or reportable segments  it is possible that the forecasts we use to support our goodwill could change in the future  which could result in non cash charges that would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we have approximately million in current and long term deferred tax assets 
sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires a valuation allowance to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if  based on the weight of the evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we review deferred tax assets periodically for recoverability and make estimates and judgments regarding the expected geographic sources of taxable income  gains from investments  as well as tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
at december   we determined that a valuation allowance of approximately million relating to foreign tax credit carryovers was necessary to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized 
if the estimates and assumptions used in our determination change in the future  we could be required to revise our estimates of the valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and adjust our provisions for additional income taxes 
in the ordinary course of global business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain  thus judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes 
we provide for income taxes on transactions based on our estimate of the probable liability 
we adjust our provision as appropriate for changes that impact our underlying judgments 
changes that impact provision estimates include such items as jurisdictional interpretations on tax filing positions based on the results of tax audits and general tax authority rulings 
due to the evolving nature of tax rules combined with the large number of jurisdictions in which we operate  it is possible that our estimates of our tax liability and the realizability of our deferred tax assets could change in the future  which may result in additional tax liabilities and adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the following discussion relating to the individual financial statement captions  our overall financial performance  operations and financial position should be read in conjunction with the factors and events described in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and risk factors  which could impact our future performance and financial position

net revenues include the following categories product licenses  license updates  online services and technical services 
product licenses primarily represent fees related to the licensing of our application virtualization products  which primarily consists of our access suite products  including presentation server  access essentials and password manager  our application networking products  which are comprised of netscaler products  ssl access gateway products  application firewall products and wanscaler products  and our other products  which include our edgesight  application gateway and in our ardence products 
in addition  we offer incentive programs to our channel distributors and value added resellers to stimulate demand for our products 
revenues associated with these programs are partially offset by these incentives to our channel distributors and value added resellers 
our application virtualization product license revenue accounted for approximately of our product license revenue for the year ended december   of our product license revenue for the year ended december  and of our product 
table of contents license revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in our application virtualization product license revenue as a percent of our total product license revenue when comparing the year ended december  to the year ended december  is primarily due to the full year impact and increased sales of our application networking products  including the addition of our wanscaler products in  and to a lesser extent  the addition of our edgesight products in during  we expect our application virtualization product license revenue to continue to decrease as a percent of our total product license revenue due to expected increases in sales of our application networking products  edgesight products and our newly acquired ardence products 
license updates consist of fees related to our subscription advantage program that are recognized ratably over the term of the contract  which is typically to months 
subscription advantage is an annual renewable program that provides subscribers with automatic delivery of software upgrades  enhancements and maintenance releases when and if they become available during the term of the subscription 
we anticipate that subscription advantage will continue to be of strategic importance to our business throughout because it fosters long term customer relationships and gives us improved visibility and predictability due to the recurring nature of this revenue stream 
online services revenues consist primarily of fees related to online service agreements and are recognized ratably over the contract term 
technical services revenues are comprised of fees from technical support services which are recognized ratably over the contract term  as well as  revenues from product training and certification  and consulting services revenue related to implementation of our products  which is recognized as the services are provided 
year ended december  compared to compared to in thousands revenues product licenses license updates online services technical services total net revenues product license revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to the full year impact and increased sales of our application networking products and  to a lesser extent  increased sales of our application virtualization products

online services revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to increased customer adoptions and renewals of our online services products 
technical services revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to the full year impact and increased sales of support and services related to our application networking products and an increase in sales of services and support related to the implementation of our application virtualization products 
we currently anticipate that our application virtualization product license revenue will be flat to slightly down when comparing the first quarter of to the fourth quarter of  however  for fiscal year  we expect product license revenue to increase overall primarily due to expected growth from sales of our application networking products  and to a lesser extent  growth from our application virtualization products 
we also anticipate that license updates revenue will increase in due primarily to increased renewals and continued growth in our installed customer base 
online services revenues are also expected to increase in product license revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to increased sales of our application networking products which were acquired in our and acquisitions and increased sales of our application virtualization products

online services revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to continued acceptance of our new and existing online services products 
technical services revenue increased during when compared to primarily due to increased sales of consulting services related to implementation of our products and  to a lesser extent  services related to our application networking products 
deferred revenues are primarily comprised of license updates revenue from our subscription advantage product  online services revenues from annual service agreements for our online services products and technical services revenues related to our support services and consulting contracts 
deferred revenues increased approximately million as of december  compared to december  is primarily due to increased renewals of subscription advantage product  increased sales of our online service agreements and  to a lesser extent  sales of services related to our application virtualization and application networking products 
we currently expect deferred revenue to continue to increase in 
table of contents we do not believe that backlog  as of any particular date  is a reliable indicator of future performance 
while it is generally our practice to promptly ship our products upon receipt of properly finalized purchase orders  we sometimes have product license orders that have not shipped or have otherwise not met all the required criteria for revenue recognition 
although the amount of such product license orders may vary  the amount  if any  of such product license orders at the end of a particular period has not been material to total revenue at the end of the same period 
international revenues international revenues sales outside the united states accounted for approximately of our net revenues for the year ended december   of our net revenues for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the decrease in international revenue as a percent of net revenues for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is primarily due to increased performance in the united states  increased sales performance and growth in our online services products and application networking products  which are currently primarily comprised of domestic revenues

during the second quarter of fiscal  we completed our evaluation of the effects of the repatriation provision of the ajca and our chief executive officer and board of directors approved our dividend reinvestment plan  or drp  under the ajca 
during  we repatriated approximately million of certain foreign earnings  of which million qualified for the dividends received deduction 
during  we recorded an estimated tax provision of approximately million related to the repatriation 
additionally  during  we recorded the reversal of approximately million for income taxes on certain foreign earnings for which a deferred tax liability had been previously recorded 
we maintain certain operational and administrative processes in overseas subsidiaries and its foreign earnings are taxed at lower foreign tax rates 
other than the one time repatriation provision under the ajca described above  we do not expect to remit earnings from our foreign subsidiaries 
we establish tax reserves when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  certain of these positions may be challenged

stock repurchase program our board of directors has authorized an ongoing stock repurchase program with a total repurchase authority granted to us of billion  of which million was authorized in february and million was authorized in october we may use the approved dollar authority to repurchase stock at any time until the approved amounts are exhausted 
the objective of our stock repurchase program is to improve stockholders return 
at december   approximately million was available to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to the stock repurchase program 
all shares repurchased are recorded as treasury stock 
we are authorized to make open market purchases of our common stock using general corporate funds 
additionally  during and  we entered into structured stock repurchase arrangements with large financial institutions using general corporate funds as part of our stock repurchase program in order to lower the average cost to acquire shares 
these programs include terms that require us to make up front payments to the counterparty financial institution and result in the receipt of stock during and or at the end of the agreement or depending on market conditions  the receipt of either stock or cash at the maturity of the agreement 
we made prepayments to financial institutions  net of premiums received of approximately million in and million in  under our structured stock repurchase arrangements

other items  such as operating lease obligations  are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements  but are required to be disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements in thousands payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations synthetic lease obligations purchase obligations total contractual obligations purchase obligations represent non cancelable commitments to purchase inventory ordered before year end 
total contractual obligations do not include agreements where our commitment is variable in nature or where cancellations without payment provisions exist 
as of december   we did not have any individually material capital lease obligations  purchase obligations  or other material long term commitments reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
off balance sheet arrangement during  we became a party to a synthetic lease arrangement totaling approximately million for our corporate headquarters office space in fort lauderdale  florida 
the synthetic lease represents a form of off balance sheet financing under which an unrelated third party lessor funded of the costs of acquiring the property and leases the asset to us 
the synthetic lease qualifies as an operating lease for accounting purposes and as a financing lease for tax purposes 
we do not include the property or the lease debt as an asset or a liability on our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
consequently  payments made pursuant to the lease are recorded as operating expenses in our consolidated statements of income 
we entered into the synthetic lease in order to lease our headquarters properties under more favorable terms than under our previous lease arrangements 
we do not materially rely on off balance sheet arrangements for our liquidity or as capital resources 
for information regarding cash outflows associated with our lease payments see contractual obligations 
the initial term of the synthetic lease is seven years 
upon approval by the lessor  we can renew the lease twice for additional two year periods 
the lease payments vary based on libor  plus a margin 
at any time during the lease term  we have the option to sublease the property and upon thirty days written notice  we have the option to purchase the property for an amount representing the original property cost and transaction fees of approximately million plus any lease breakage costs and outstanding amounts owed 
upon at least days notice prior to the termination of the initial lease term  we have the option to remarket the property for sale to a third party 
if we choose not to purchase the property at the end of the lease term  we have guaranteed a residual value to the lessor of approximately million and possession of the buildings will be returned to the lessor 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the property for indications of permanent impairment 
if an evaluation were to indicate that the fair value of the property were to decline below million  we would be responsible for the difference under our residual value guarantee  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
the synthetic lease includes certain financial covenants including a requirement for us to maintain a restricted cash  cash equivalent or investment balance of approximately million as collateral  which is classified as restricted cash equivalents and investments in our accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
we maintain the ability to manage the composition of restricted investments within certain limits and to withdraw and use excess investment earnings from the pledged collateral for operating purposes 
additionally  we must maintain a minimum net cash and investment balance of million  excluding our collateralized investments  equity investments and outstanding debt as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and investments in excess of this required level 
the synthetic lease includes non financial covenants  including the maintenance of the property and adequate insurance  prompt delivery of financial statements to the administrative agent of the lessor and prompt payment of taxes associated with the property 
as of december   we were in compliance with all material provisions of the arrangement 
our synthetic lease contains a number of affirmative and negative covenants 
because of delays in filing this annual report on form k for the year ended december   our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended march  and our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended june   we were at risk of breaching the affirmative covenants requiring our annual report on form k to be provided to the lessor within days after the end of our fiscal year and 
table of contents our quarterly reports on form q within days after the end of our fiscal quarters  respectively 
we received waivers related to these anticipated covenant breaches to extend the due date of this annual report on form k for the year ended december  and our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended march  and our quarterly report on form q for the three months ended june  until october  we have notified our lessor that we will provide such reports to the lessor by the extension date 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which addresses the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
in december  the fasb issued fin no 
revised  which replaced fin no 
fin no 
revised was effective immediately for certain disclosure requirements and variable interest entities referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after december  and for other types of entities for financial statements for periods ending after march  we determined that we are not required to consolidate the lessor  the leased facility or the related debt associated with our synthetic lease in accordance with fin no 
revised 
accordingly  there was no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows from adoption 
however  if the lessor were to change its ownership of the property or significantly change its ownership of other properties that it currently holds  we could be required to consolidate the entity  the leased facility and the debt in a future period 
commitments capital expenditures were million during  million during and million during during  capital expenditures were primarily related to the implementation of certain systems to streamline business operations and enhance management reporting capabilities and leasehold improvements 
during  capital expenditures were primarily related to computer equipment purchases associated with our research and development activities  software purchases related to improving our internal infrastructure and leasehold improvements 
during and  we took actions to consolidate certain of our offices  including the exit of certain leased office space and the abandonment of certain leasehold improvements 
during the third quarter of  we entered into an agreement  which assigned the operating lease and all remaining liability related to one of the closed offices to a third party 
lease obligations related to the remaining existing operating lease continue to with a total remaining obligation at december  of approximately million  of which million was accrued as of december   and is reflected in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
in calculating this accrual  we made estimates  based on market information  including the estimated vacancy periods and sublease rates and opportunities 
we periodically re evaluate our estimates  and if actual circumstances prove to be materially worse than management has estimated  the total charges for these vacant facilities could be significantly higher 
because virtually all holders of stock options granted by us were not involved in or aware of the incorrect pricing of certain options  we have taken and intend to take further actions to address certain adverse tax consequences that may be incurred by the holders of such incorrectly priced options 
the primary adverse tax consequence is that the re measured options vesting after december  subject the option holder to a penalty tax under section a of the irc and  as applicable  similar excise taxes under state laws 
as a result during the first quarter of  we recorded million  net of income tax  in liabilities related to the anticipated payment by us of payroll and excise taxes on behalf of our employees for options that were exercised during open tax years under the related statutes 
we expect to incur approximately million  net of income tax  in additional charges to correct future adverse tax consequences under irc section a related to future employee option exercises of incorrectly priced stock options 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
the analysis methods we used to assess and mitigate risk discussed below should not be considered projections of future events  gains or losses 
we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates that could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
to mitigate foreign currency risk  we utilize derivative financial instruments 
the counterparties to our derivative instruments are major financial institutions 
all of the potential changes noted below are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results could differ materially 

table of contents discussions of our accounting policies for derivatives and hedging activities are included in notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  exposure to exchange rates a substantial majority of our overseas expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in local currencies  including euros  british pounds sterling  australian dollars  swiss francs  japanese yen  hong kong dollars  canadian dollars  danish krone and swedish krona 
to reduce exposure to reduction in us dollar value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in currency exchange rates  we have established a hedging program 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain forecasted foreign currency expenditures 
our hedging program significantly reduces  but does not entirely eliminate  the impact of currency exchange rate movements 
at december  and  we had in place foreign currency forward sale contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  and foreign currency forward purchase contracts with a notional amount of million and million  respectively 
at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair asset value of million and at december   these contracts had an aggregate fair liability value of million 
based on a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates  the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts would decrease the asset by million  resulting in a net liability position 
conversely  a hypothetical depreciation of the us dollar from december  market rates would increase the fair value of our foreign currency forward contracts by million 
in these hypothetical movements  foreign operating costs would move in the opposite direction 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates quantified above  changes in exchange rates could also change the dollar value of sales and affect the volume of sales as competitors products become more or less attractive 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows as a result of these foreign exchange forward contracts 
exposure to interest rates we have interest rate exposures resulting from our interest based available for sale securities 
we maintain available for sale investments in debt securities and we limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or type of instrument 
the securities in our investment portfolio are not leveraged 
the securities classified as available for sale are subject to interest rate risk 
the modeling technique used measures the change in fair values arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market interest rates and assumes that ending fair values include principal plus accrued interest and reinvestment income 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points from december  and levels  the fair value of the available for sale portfolio would decline by approximately million and million  respectively 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate movements on our available for sale investment portfolios 
this analysis does not consider the effect of credit risk as a result of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
during the third quarter of  we terminated all of our interest rate swap agreements due to the sale of the underlying available for sale investments 
for more information see notes and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the year ended december  during  we entered into the credit facility  as amended in  or the amended credit facility 
accordingly  we could be exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on our long term debt 
this exposure relates to our million amended credit facility 
borrowings under the amended credit facility currently bear interest at variable rates based on libor plus and adjusts in the future in the range of to above libor based on our level of total debt and our adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
a hypothetical interest rate change would not have any current impact on our results of operations as we have no amounts outstanding on the amended credit facility as of december  in april  we entered into a synthetic lease with a substantive lessor totaling approximately million related to office space utilized for our corporate headquarters in fort lauderdale  florida 
payments under this synthetic lease are indexed to a variable interest rate libor plus a margin 
based upon our interest rate exposure under this synthetic lease at december   a basis point change in the current interest rate would have an immaterial effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in addition to interest rate exposure  if the fair value of our headquarters property  under this synthetic lease  were to significantly decline  there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition
