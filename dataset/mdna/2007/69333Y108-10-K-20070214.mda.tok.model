no cash dividends were paid during any of the five previous years 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following section presents an overview of our restaurant concepts and the related growth strategy and challenges we face 
a summary of our financial results and our outlook are also presented 
our restaurants we own and operate three restaurant concepts in the asian niche pf chang s china bistro bistro  pei wei asian diner pei wei and taneko japanese tavern taneko 
as of december   we owned and operated full service bistro restaurants that feature a blend of high quality  traditional chinese cuisine with attentive service and american hospitality in a sophisticated  contemporary bistro setting 
pf chang s was formed in early with the acquisition of the four original bistro restaurants and the hiring of an experienced management team 
utilizing a partnership management philosophy  we embarked on a strategic expansion of the concept targeted at major metropolitan areas throughout the united states 
we own and operate all of our restaurants with the exception of a new bistro located in honolulu  hawaii which opened in september under a joint venture arrangement in which we own a minority interest 
as of december   we also owned and operated quick casual pei wei restaurants that offer a modest menu of freshly prepared  high quality asian cuisine served in a relaxed  warm environment offering attentive counter service and take out flexibility 
pei wei opened its first unit in july in the phoenix  arizona area and has expanded significantly since then 
additionally  on october   we opened our first taneko restaurant in scottsdale  arizona  featuring natural  organic and seasonal ingredients highlighting the diverse cooking styles of japan 
inspired by izakayas  or local taverns  taneko offers an extensive variety of food and beverages in a comfortable atmosphere 
our strategy our vision is to be the best operator of asian restaurants as viewed by our guests and our employees 
we aim to develop and operate a nationwide system of asian inspired restaurants that offer guests a sophisticated dining experience  create a loyal customer base that generates a high level of repeat business and provide superior returns to our investors 
to achieve our objectives  we strive to offer high quality asian cuisine in a memorable atmosphere while delivering exceptional customer service and an excellent dining value 
we are currently operating exclusively asian restaurants due in part to the rising popularity of asian cuisine  combined with a relatively lower level of organized competition in this segment compared to other popular cuisines such as mexican and italian 
we believe this creates a significant opportunity for us to both grow our existing restaurant sales and open new locations in new and existing markets 
we are selective when choosing our new restaurant locations and currently assess anticipated returns on invested capital at both an individual restaurant and market level when determining future development plans 
we seek an average unit level return on invested capital of percent and plan to continue opening new restaurants to the extent that we continue to achieve our required rate of return 
historically  we have focused on domestic operations and organic business growth by developing new concepts and opening new restaurants 
while this growth strategy remains unchanged for  we may consider 
table of contents additional expansion opportunities into international markets and potential acquisitions as well as brand expansion through sales of our proprietary products in the future 
our challenges the restaurant business is intensely competitive with respect to food quality  price value relationships  ambiance  service and location  and many existing restaurants compete with us at each of our locations 
key competitive factors in the industry include the quality and value of the food  quality of service  price  dining experience  restaurant location and the ambiance of the facilities 
additionally  the rising popularity of asian cuisine may result in increased competition from new asian branded concepts as well as non asian restaurants that may increase their asian inspired menu offerings 
in addition to being highly competitive  the restaurant industry is often affected by changes in consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns  economic conditions  lifestyle trends and cost fluctuations 
accordingly  we strive to continuously evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concepts to help maintain and enhance the strength of our brands and remain fresh and relevant to our guests 
as we continue to expand  we are faced with increasing demand for high quality human resources and must attract  develop and retain top talent to ensure the future success of our business 
additionally  we are focused on leveraging our infrastructure to support our growth and yield increasing returns as we reach higher capacity 
our financial results our financial results include consolidated revenue growth of million or percent to million  driven primarily by new restaurant openings  offset by a decline in comparable store sales at both the bistro and pei wei  consolidated net income decline of million or percent to million and a decrease in diluted earnings per share of or percent to  primarily due to lower income from operations resulting from the recognition of million after tax in share based compensation expense and million after tax in preopening rent during the construction period during  and new bistro openings  new pei wei openings  one joint venture bistro opening and the first taneko opening 
our results continue to be affected by concept growth in  particularly as the number of pei wei restaurants increased by almost percent during the year 
as we continue to develop and expand our restaurant concepts at different rates  our financial results will be impacted by the mix of the number of restaurants in our concepts and the ratio of newer restaurants to more established restaurants within those concepts 
this is due to the different operating characteristics of our brands as well as variations in the economics of our new restaurants compared to our more seasoned restaurants 
we opened taneko this year as our third restaurant concept  marking our entrance into japanese inspired cuisine 
it is still very early in the development of this concept and we are closely monitoring taneko s operations and results 
there is currently no assurance we will open another taneko in the future 
share based compensation we grant stock options for a fixed number of shares to certain employees and directors with an exercise price equal to or greater than the fair value of the shares at the date of grant 
we also grant restricted stock with a fair value determined based on our closing stock price on the date of grant 
we previously accounted for stock option grants in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations for fiscal and prior  and  accordingly  recognized no compensation expense for the stock option grants for those periods 
on january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  and sec staff 
table of contents accounting bulletin no 
sab  share based payment  requiring the measurement and recognition of all share based compensation under the fair value method 
we implemented sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which does not result in the restatement of previously issued financial statements 
the fair value of options granted was estimated at the date of grant using a black scholes option pricing model 
option valuation models  including black scholes  require the input of highly subjective assumptions  and changes in the assumptions used can materially affect the grant date fair value of an award 
these assumptions include the risk free rate of interest  expected dividend yield  expected volatility  and the expected life of the award 
the risk free rate of interest is based on the zero coupon us treasury rates appropriate for the expected term of the award 
expected dividends are zero based on history of not paying cash dividends on our common stock 
expected volatility is based on historic  daily stock price observations of our common stock during the period immediately preceding the share based award grant that is equal in length to the award s expected term 
sfas r also requires that estimated forfeitures be included as a part of the grant date estimate 
we use historical data to estimate expected employee behaviors related to option exercises and forfeitures 
prior to our adoption of sfas r  we reduced pro forma share based compensation expense  presented in the notes to our financial statements  for actual forfeitures as they occurred 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models or assumptions  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values  except for annual adjustments to reflect actual forfeitures 
the fair value of restricted stock is determined based on our closing stock price on the date of grant 
restricted stock vests and becomes unrestricted three years after the date of grant 
share based compensation expense is recognized ratably over the three year service period 
non vested share based compensation totaled million for stock options and million for restricted stock at december  and will be expensed over the remaining weighted average vesting period which is approximately years for stock options and years for restricted stock 
we granted options to purchase  shares of our common stock and issued restricted stock totaling  shares during fiscal preopening expense preopening expense  consisting primarily of manager salaries and relocation expense  employee payroll and related training costs incurred prior to the opening of a restaurant  is expensed as incurred 
also included in preopening expense is the accrual for straight line rent recorded prior to a restaurant s opening date 
in accordance with fasb staff position no 
 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period  as of january   we ceased the capitalization of rent during the construction period which resulted in million in preopening rent during fiscal unit economics we believe that unit economics are critical to the long term success of any restaurant concept 
accordingly  we focus on unit level returns over time  as a key measurement of our success or failure 
for analysis purposes  we group our restaurants by the year in which they opened 
we then compare each class to its peers over time as well as to the performance of the entire system 
these unit economics are available on our website at www

new development we intend to open new bistros in we will continue our development in existing markets and plan to enter eight new markets in we have signed lease agreements for all of our development planned for fiscal we intend to continue to develop bistro restaurants that typically range in size from  to  square feet  and that require  on average  a total cash investment of approximately million to million and total invested capital of approximately million per restaurant net of estimated landlord reimbursements 
this total capitalized investment includes the capitalized lease value of the property  which can vary greatly depending on the specific trade area 
see risk factors development and construction risks 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  per restaurant during  which includes approximately  per restaurant in preopening rent 

table of contents we also intend to open pei wei restaurants in we will continue our development in existing markets and plan to enter nine new markets in we have signed lease agreements for all of our development planned for fiscal our pei wei restaurants are generally  to  square feet in size and require an average total cash investment of approximately  to  and total invested capital of approximately million per restaurant net of estimated landlord reimbursements 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  per restaurant during  which includes approximately  per restaurant in preopening rent 
change in partnership structure we utilize a partnership philosophy to facilitate the development  leadership and operation of our restaurants 
historically  this philosophy was embodied in a traditional legal partnership structure  which included capital contributions from our partners in exchange for an ownership stake in the profits and losses of our restaurants 
effective january for new store openings  the bistro will employ a different structure to achieve the same goal 
at the restaurant level  our operating partner and culinary partner partners in the philosophical not legal sense will share in the profitability of the restaurant as well as participate in a long term incentive program that rewards enhancement of economic value 
due to this change in partnership structure  individuals participating in the new plan will receive amounts classified as compensation rather than a share of partnership earnings 
accordingly  compensation expense for our operating and culinary partners will be reflected in the consolidated income statement as labor expense 
additionally  a similar structure exists for our market partners and regional vice presidents  with related compensation reflected as general and administrative expense in the consolidated income statement 
partner investment expense will no longer be recognized for new bistro restaurant openings beginning in as a result of this change 
see critical accounting policies below for further information regarding partnership accounting 
the pei wei partnership structure is not affected by the changes at the bistro and the traditional partnership structure remains in effect for new pei wei restaurant openings during critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require significant judgment 
partnership structure under our existing partnership program  each partner who wishes to participate in our legal partnership structure  to the extent applicable  is required to make a cash capital contribution in exchange for a specified interest in the partnership 
the ownership interest purchased by each partner generally ranges between two and ten percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees generally no more than ten percent of an individual restaurant is owned in total by minority partners 
we perform an assessment of what the imputed fair value of these interests might be for a passive equity investor ie not someone actually working in the restaurant  utilizing a discounted cash flow model and updated assumptions based on the results of an annual valuation analysis performed by a third party valuation specialist 
this methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 
any excess of the imputed fair value of these interests  determined by using the discounted cash flow model  over the cash contribution paid by our partners is currently recognized as expense upon purchase of the respective interest 
see change in partnership structure section above for information regarding changes to be implemented during fiscal to the bistro partnership program 
at the end of a specific term generally five years  we have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the minority partner s interest in the partner s respective restaurant or region at fair value 
the estimated fair value for such purchases and sales is determined by reference to current industry purchase metrics as well as the historical cash flows or net income of the subject restaurant or region 
we have the option to pay the agreed upon purchase price in cash over a period of time not to exceed five years 
given that there is no public market for these interests  the fair value determinations are subjective and require the use of various estimates for which significant judgments 
table of contents are required 
the excess of the purchase price over the imputed fair value of these interests was recognized as expense in the month the repurchase occurred for all fiscal years prior to and including any excess of the purchase price over the imputed fair value is currently recorded as an intangible asset and amortized over approximately years for our bistro restaurants and approximately years for our pei wei restaurants 
there is also the possibility of additional charges relating to the modification if  within the initial five year period of the respective interest  we repurchase that interest at a value greater than required by the agreements prior to modification 
as of december   this requirement relates to percent of our total partnership interests outstanding 
lease obligation we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
the lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we obtain possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
prior to january   we capitalized rent expense from possession date through construction completion and reported the related asset in property and equipment 
capitalized rent was amortized through depreciation and amortization expense over the estimated useful life of the related assets limited to the lease term 
straight line rent recorded during the preopening period construction completion through restaurant open date was recorded as preopening expense 
beginning january   we expense rent from possession date through restaurant open date as preopening expense  in accordance with fasb staff position no 
 accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
once a restaurant opens for business  we record straight line rent over the lease term plus contingent rent to the extent it exceeded the minimum rent obligation per the lease agreement 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in store opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lesser occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on the straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rents paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
certain leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rentals 
contingent rentals are accrued each period as the liabilities are incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
this results in some variability in occupancy expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements forfeitures 
we contracted with a third party consultant who utilized our historical data to validate our assumptions for the 
table of contents option grants 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized on the consolidated statements of income 
impairment of long lived assets we review property and equipment which includes leasehold improvements and intangible assets with finite lives those assets resulting from the acquisition of minority interests in the operating rights of certain of our restaurants for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired  but at least annually 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the restaurant or partnership level for indicators of permanent impairment 
judgments and estimates made related to long lived assets are affected by factors such as economic conditions  changes in historical resale values and changes in operating performance 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our current and prior years exposures related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and dental programs 
we have paid to our insurance carrier amounts that approximate the cost of claims known to date and we have accrued additional liabilities for our estimate of ultimate costs related to those claims 
we develop these estimates with our insurance providers and use historical experience factors to estimate the ultimate claim exposure 
we validate our self insurance reserve by contracting with third party actuaries who utilize estimates of expected losses  based on statistical analyses of historical industry data as well as our actual historical trends 
the liabilities recorded in our consolidated financial statements are consistent with the actuarial estimates 
if actual claims experience differs from our assumptions and estimates  changes in our insurance reserves would impact the expense recorded in our consolidated income statements 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state liabilities 
these estimates include  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time that we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
tax contingency reserves result from our estimates of potential liabilities resulting from differences between actual and audited results 
changes in the tax contingency reserve result from resolution of audits of prior year filings  the expiration of the statute of limitations  changes in tax laws and current year estimates for asserted and unasserted items 
inherent uncertainties exist in estimates of tax contingencies due to changes in tax law  both legislated and concluded through the various jurisdictions tax court systems 
significant changes in our estimates could adversely affect our reported results 
results of operations we operate on a week year  with the fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to december fiscal years and were comprised of weeks and fiscal year was comprised of weeks

table of contents revenues our revenues are derived primarily from food and beverage sales 
each segment contributed to current year revenue growth as follows bistro the increase in revenues was attributable to revenues of million generated by the new bistro restaurants opened in and a million increase in revenues generated by the bistro restaurants that opened during  partially offset by a million net decrease in revenues for restaurants that opened prior to the increase in revenues is the result of new store openings and a full year of revenue for those stores opened during as well as an approximate effective price increase impacting all restaurants 
such increases were partially offset by a slight decline in overall guest traffic during fiscal bistro revenues also include licensing fees of million related to our portion of revenues from a bistro in hawaii which opened in september and is operated under a joint venture arrangement 
pei wei the increase in revenues was attributable to revenues of million generated by new restaurants opened in and a million increase in revenues generated by the restaurants that opened during  partially offset by a million net decrease in revenues for restaurants that opened prior to the increase in revenues is the result of new store openings and a full year of revenue for those stores opened during as well as an approximate effective price increase impacting all restaurants 
such increases were partially offset by a slight decline in overall guest traffic during fiscal in addition to the revenues earned by our bistro and pei wei restaurants  consolidated revenues include million in revenues at our new taneko concept 
costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales is comprised of the cost of food and beverages 
each segment contributed as follows bistro cost of sales as a percentage of revenues at the bistro decreased primarily due to lower poultry costs partially offset by higher meat and dry food costs 
pei wei cost of sales as a percentage of revenues at pei wei decreased primarily due to lower poultry costs partially offset by higher dry and other food expense 
labor labor expenses consist of restaurant management salaries  hourly staff payroll costs  other payroll related items and imputed partner bonus expense 
imputed partner bonus expense represents the portion of restaurant level operating results that are allocable to minority partners  but are presented as bonus expense for accounting purposes see note to our consolidated financial statements for further details 
each segment contributed as follows bistro labor expenses as a percentage of revenues at the bistro were unchanged as increases in efficiency as measured by sales per labor hour and the benefit of reduced health insurance and workers compensation liabilities  resulting from lower than anticipated claims activity were offset by higher management incentives and wage rate pressure in our culinary positions 
pei wei labor expenses as a percentage of revenues at pei wei increased primarily due to wage rate pressure in our culinary positions  increased management salaries due to higher staffing and decreased leverage due to lower average weekly sales 
operating operating expenses consist primarily of various restaurant level costs such as repairs and maintenance  utilities and marketing  which are generally variable and fluctuate with revenues 
our experience to date has been that operating costs during the first four to nine months of a newly opened restaurant are materially greater than 
table of contents what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
each segment contributed as follows bistro operating expenses as a percentage of revenues at our bistro restaurants increased primarily due to higher utility costs related to an increase in rates and usage  an adjustment resulting from a second quarter modification of our accounting policy related to utility accruals and higher repairs and maintenance costs  partially offset by a reduction in radio advertising usage 
additionally  decreased leverage due to lower average weekly sales contributed to the increase 
pei wei operating expenses as a percentage of revenues at our pei wei restaurants increased primarily due to higher utility costs related to an increase in rates and an adjustment resulting from a second quarter modification of our accounting policy related to utility accruals 
additionally  decreased leverage due to lower average weekly sales contributed to the increase while lower take out supplies costs partially offset the increase 
occupancy occupancy costs include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property insurance and property taxes 
each segment contributed as follows bistro occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues at the bistro increased primarily due to the benefit of a cumulative adjustment for capital lease assets recorded in fiscal  decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales and higher property tax expense in the current year 
pei wei occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues at pei wei increased primarily due to decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales and higher property tax expense in the current year 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with corporate and administrative functions that support development and restaurant operations and provide infrastructure to support future growth  including management and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  legal and professional fees  technology and market research 
each segment contributed as follows bistro general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenues at the bistro increased primarily due to the recognition of share based compensation expense during fiscal as well as higher management incentive accruals and  to a lesser extent  an increase in compensation and benefits expense 
these items were partially offset by the benefit of reduced health insurance liabilities resulting from lower than anticipated claims activity 
pei wei general and administrative costs at pei wei increased primarily due to an increase in compensation and benefits expense related to the addition of corporate management personnel as well as the recognition of share based compensation expense during fiscal and  to a lesser extent  higher travel related expenses and greater health insurance expenses resulting from higher enrollment  offset by lower than anticipated claims activity 
as a percentage of revenues  pei wei s general and administrative costs were unchanged from the prior year 
shared services and other general and administrative costs for shared services and other increased primarily due to the recognition of share based compensation expense during fiscal other factors that contributed to the increase were higher compensation and benefits expense primarily related to the addition of corporate management personnel  an increase in accounting  consulting and legal fees and  to a lesser extent  higher management incentive accruals 
these items were slightly offset by a reduction in rent expense due to the purchase of our new headquarters building in fiscal 
table of contents depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation and amortization of fixed assets  gains and losses on disposal of assets and the amortization of intangible assets and non transferable liquor license fees 
each segment contributed as follows bistro depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to a full year s depreciation and amortization on restaurants opened in fiscal  additional depreciation and amortization on restaurants that opened during fiscal and  to a lesser extent  an increase in amortization of intangible and other assets 
the increase was also due to higher average capital expenditures for new restaurants and a change in the amortization of non transferable liquor license fees during fiscal these items were partially offset by a decrease relating to a cumulative adjustment for capital lease assets recorded in fiscal pei wei depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to a full year s depreciation and amortization on restaurants opened in fiscal and additional depreciation and amortization on restaurants that opened during fiscal the increase was also due to decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales  higher average capital expenditures for new restaurants and a change in the amortization of non transferable liquor license fees during fiscal preopening expense preopening expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist of expenses incurred prior to opening a new restaurant and are comprised principally of manager salaries and relocation  employee payroll and related training costs 
beginning in fiscal  preopening expenses also include straight line rent for the period between the possession date of leased premises and the restaurant opening date 
prior to fiscal  only straight line rent for the period between construction completion date and the restaurant opening date  which generally approximated two weeks  was included in preopening expense 
each segment contributed as follows bistro preopening expense increased primarily due to the recognition of preopening rent during construction recognized in  the impact of opening new bistro restaurants in compared to new bistro restaurants in and a slight increase in the average per location preopening costs incurred during fiscal  due to a delay in the opening date of certain new restaurants 
pei wei preopening expense increased primarily due to the recognition of preopening rent during construction recognized in and the impact of opening new pei wei restaurants in compared to new pei wei restaurants in  partially offset by a slight decrease in the average per location preopening costs incurred during fiscal this decrease in overage costs was primarily due to lower manager salary and travel costs associated with the higher ratio of restaurant openings in mature markets versus new markets during partner investment expense partner investment expense represents the difference between the imputed fair value of our partners ownership interests at the time the partners invest in their restaurants and our partners cash contributions for those ownership interests  as well as the change in the fair value of partner s interest at inception compared to fair value at the date of repurchase for those partners who are bought out prior to the expiration of the initial five year period of the partnership 
each segment contributed as follows bistro partner investment expense at the bistro decreased slightly primarily due to increased expense reductions related to minority partner buyouts in the current year and the impact of a lower imputed fair value of partnership interests in new bistro restaurants in  partially offset by expense associated with two additional restaurants that opened in fiscal as compared to fiscal pei wei partner investment expense at pei wei decreased primarily due to increased expense reductions related to minority partner buyouts in the current year and the impact of a lower imputed fair value of partnership interests in new pei wei restaurants in 
table of contents interest and other income expense  net consolidated interest and other income expense  net decreased primarily due to the recognition of accretion expense related to our conditional asset retirement obligations see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion and lower interest income resulting from the sale of interest bearing securities to finance our share repurchase program  which commenced during third quarter see share repurchase program in the liquidity and capital resources section for further detail  partially offset by a higher year over year rate of return on our investments 
minority interest minority interest represents the portion of our net earnings which is attributable to the collective ownership interests of our minority investors 
we employ a partnership management structure whereby we have entered into a series of partnership agreements with our regional managers  certain of our general managers  and certain of our executive chefs 
we also had minority shareholders in our pei wei asian diner  inc subsidiary as of january  each segment contributed as follows bistro minority interest as a percentage of revenues at the bistro decreased due to the impact of partner buyouts occurring during fiscal as well as the impact of lower restaurant net income 
pei wei minority interest as a percentage of revenues at pei wei decreased slightly due to the impact of lower restaurant net income 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal disregarding the benefit of million in reserve adjustments due to closure of audits during offset by million in newly identified tax exposure items  our effective tax rate was 
in accordance with accounting principles board no 
 interim financial reporting  we estimate our effective tax rate for the entire year and apply it to our interim operating results 
when significant unusual charges occur  the income tax effect for such charges is computed separately and is not included in the estimated annual effective tax rate 
the income tax rates for fiscal and fiscal differed from the expected provision for income taxes  which is derived by applying the statutory income tax rate  primarily as a result of fica tip credits

 interim financial reporting  we estimate our effective tax rate for the entire year and apply it to our interim operating results 
when significant unusual charges occur  such as the million charge during the first quarter of relating to the modification of our partnership agreements and the  charge relating to a legal settlement  the income tax effect for such charges is computed separately and not included in the estimated annual effective tax rate

historically  we have experienced variability in the amount and percentage of revenues attributable to preopening expenses 
we typically incur the most significant portion of preopening expenses associated with a given restaurant within the two months immediately preceding  and the month of  the opening of the restaurant 
additionally  there may be variability in the amount and percentage of revenues attributable to partner investment expense as a result of the timing of opening new restaurants and the timing of purchasing partner interests 
partner 
table of contents investment expense generally represents the difference between the imputed fair value of our partners ownership interests and our partners cash capital contribution for these interests 
in addition  our experience to date has been that labor and operating costs associated with a newly opened restaurant for the first several months of operation are materially greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
accordingly  the volume and timing of new restaurant openings has had and is expected to continue to have  a meaningful impact on preopening expenses  labor  operating and partner investment costs until such time as a larger base of restaurants in operation mitigates such impact 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity is cash provided by operations  though we also borrow under our credit facility from time to time 
historically  our need for capital resources has primarily resulted from our construction of new restaurants

future capital requirements our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and any potential repurchases of our common stock 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  together with our current cash reserves and available credit lines  will be sufficient to fund our projected capital requirements through and the foreseeable future 
in the unlikely event that additional capital is required  we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financing 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to current shareholders 
we can not assure you that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all
