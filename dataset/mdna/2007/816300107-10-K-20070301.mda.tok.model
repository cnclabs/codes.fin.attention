introduction selective insurance group  inc  selective  the company  we  or our offers property and casualty insurance products and diversified insurance services through its various subsidiaries 
selective classifies its businesses into three operating segments i insurance operations  ii investments  and iii diversified insurance services 
the purpose of the management s discussion and analysis md a is to provide an understanding of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition and known trends and uncertainties that may have a material impact in future periods 
for convenience and reading ease  we have written the md a in the first person plural 
in the md a  we will discuss and analyze the following critical accounting policies and estimates  financial highlights of results for years ended december    and  results of operations and related information by segment  financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources  off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments  federal income taxes  and adoption of accounting pronouncements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have identified the policies and estimates described below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of the results of our operations 
our preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
those estimates that were most critical to the preparation of the financial statements involved the following i reserve for losses and loss expenses  ii deferred policy acquisition costs  iii pension and postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions  and iv other than temporary investment impairments 

table of contents reserves for losses and loss expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss expenses  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and loss expenses 
as of december   the company had accrued billion of gross loss and loss expense reserves compared to billion at december  how reserves are established when a claim is reported to an insurance subsidiary  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments and periodic reviews of the case 
in addition to case reserves  we maintain estimates of reserves for losses and loss expenses incurred but not yet reported ibnr 
using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we project our estimate of ultimate losses and loss expenses at each reporting date 
the difference between i projected ultimate loss and loss expense reserves and ii case loss reserves and loss expense reserves thereon are carried as the ibnr reserve 
the actuarial techniques used are part of a comprehensive reserving process that includes two primary components 
the first component is a detailed quarterly reserve analysis performed by our internal actuarial staff  which is managed independently from the operating units 
in completing this analysis  the actuaries are required to make numerous assumptions  including  for example  the selection of loss development factors and the weight to be applied to each individual actuarial indication 
these indications include paid and incurred versions for the following actuarial methodologies loss development  bornhuetter ferguson  berquist sherman  and frequency severity 
additionally  the actuaries must gather substantially similar data in sufficient volume to ensure the statistical credibility of the data 
the second component of the analysis is the projection of the expected ultimate loss ratio for each line of business for the current accident year 
this projection is part of the company s planning process wherein the expected loss ratios are reviewed and updated each quarter 
this review includes actual versus expected pricing changes  loss trend assumptions  and updated prior period loss ratios from the most recent quarterly reserve analysis 
in addition to the most recent loss trends  a range of possible ibnr reserves is determined annually and continually considered  among other factors  in establishing ibnr for each reporting period 
loss trends include  but are not limited to  large loss activity  environmental claim activity  large case reserve additions or reductions for prior accident years  and reinsurance recoverable issues 
the company also considers factors such as i per claim information  ii company and industry historical loss experience  iii legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and iv trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
based on the consideration of the range of possible ibnr reserves  recent loss trends  uncertainty associated with actuarial assumptions and other factors  ibnr is established and the ultimate net liability for losses and loss expenses is determined 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment given that it is frequently not possible to determine whether a change in the data is an anomaly until some time after the event 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to reliably determine the extent of the change until some time later 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by many factors 
the changes in these estimates  resulting from the continuous review process and the differences between estimates and ultimate payments  are reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the period in which such estimates are changed 
any changes in the liability estimate may be material to the results of operations in future periods 
major trends by line of business creating additional loss and loss expense reserve uncertainty the insurance subsidiaries are multi state  multi line property and casualty insurance companies and  as such  are subject to reserve uncertainty stemming from a variety of sources 
these uncertainties are considered at each step in the process of establishing loss and loss expense reserves 
however  as market conditions change  certain trends are identified that management believes create an additional amount of uncertainty 
a discussion of recent trends  by line of business  that have been recognized by management follows 
workers compensation with million  or of our total recorded reserves  net of reinsurance at december   workers compensation is our largest reserved line of business 
in addition to the uncertainties associated with actuarial assumptions and methodologies described above  workers compensation is the line of business that is most susceptible to unexpected changes in the cost of medical services because of the length of time over which medical services are provided and the unpredictability of medical cost inflation 
in  we had sufficient evidence of greater than expected increases in our workers compensation medical costs and raised our reserves in this line of business by million for 
table of contents accident years and prior 
in  while medical cost trends were higher than historical amounts  they were lower than and were close to expected amounts in our reserve analysis 
as a result  in  reserves for prior accident years were reduced by the relatively moderate amount of million 
the higher than historical increase in medical costs in and could be a relatively short term anomaly  in which case our historical patterns would be the best basis for future projections 
if higher trends continue on a longer term  our historical patterns will be less meaningful in predicting future loss costs and could result in significant adverse reserve development 
general liability at december   our general liability line of business had recorded reserves  net of reinsurance of million  which represented of our total net reserves 
in recent years  this line of business has experienced adverse development mainly due to coverage for completed work under policies issued to contractors and higher than expected legal expenses 
contractors general liability business in the late s was our fastest growing class of business  which brought with it more complex claims and created challenges in estimating the related reserves 
by  we had gained a better understanding of the underwriting complexities and were able to implement initiatives to improve the financial results for this line 
accordingly  our adverse development in of million for this line of business was driven by reserve increases for accident years and prior  and was partially offset by favorable development in accident years and as we compiled additional experience to improve our actuarial projections of expected ultimate losses 
at this time  management has not identified any recent trends that would create additional significant reserve uncertainty for this line of business 
commercial automobile at december   our commercial automobile line of business had recorded reserves  net of reinsurance  of million  which represented of our total net reserves 
this line of business has experienced favorable loss development in recent years driven by a downward trend in large claims 
the number of large claims has a high degree of volatility from year to year and  therefore  requires a longer period before true trends are recognized and can be acted upon 
we have experienced lower than expected severity in accident years through  which resulted in favorable development in and of million and million  respectively 
this result is driven by trends that are positively affecting the commercial auto insurance market in general  as well as by selective specific initiatives such as i the increase in lower hazard auto business as a percentage of our overall commercial auto book of business  ii a re underwriting of our newest operating region  and iii a more proactive approach to loss prevention 
at this time  the lower trend in large claims has to some extent leveled off and management has not identified any other recent trends that would create significant reserve uncertainty for this line of business 
personal automobile at december   our personal automobile line of business had recorded reserves  net of reinsurance  of million  which represented of our total net reserves 
the majority of this business is written in the state of new jersey  where the judicial and regulatory environment has been subject to significant changes over the past few decades 
the most recent change occurred in june  when the new jersey supreme court ruled that the serious life impact standard does not apply to the automobile insurance cost reduction act s limitation on lawsuit threshold 
consequently  we increased reserves for this line of business by million in the second quarter of this recent judicial decision  however  also has increased the amount of uncertainty surrounding our personal automobile reserves  as much of the historical information used to make assumptions has been rendered less effective as a basis for projecting future results 
other lines of business at december   no other individual line of business had recorded reserves of more than million  net of reinsurance 
management  at this time  has not identified any recent trends that would create additional significant reserve uncertainty for these other lines of business 
the following tables provide case and ibnr reserves for losses  reserves for loss expenses  and reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses as of december  and 
table of contents reinsurance recoverable on unpaid loss reserves loss losses and as of december  case ibnr expense loss in thousands reserves reserves total reserves expenses net reserves commercial automobile workers compensation general liability commercial property business owners policy bonds other total commercial lines personal automobile homeowners other total personal lines total reinsurance recoverable on unpaid loss reserves loss losses and as of december  case ibnr expense loss in thousands reserves reserves total reserves expenses net reserves commercial automobile workers compensation general liability commercial property business owners policy bonds other total commercial personal automobile homeowners other total personal lines total range of reasonable reserves the company established a range of reasonably possible reserves for net claims of approximately  million to  million at december  and of  million to  million at december  a low and high reasonable reserve selection was derived primarily by considering the range of indications calculated using generally accepted actuarial techniques 
such techniques assume that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  are an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
although this range reflects the most likely scenarios  it is possible that the final outcomes may fall above or below these amounts 
this range does not include a provision for potential increases or decreases associated with environmental reserves  as management believes it is not meaningful to calculate a range given the uncertainties associated with environmental claims 
management s best estimate is consistent with the actuarial best estimate 
the company does not discount to present value that portion of its loss reserves expected to be paid in future periods  however  the loss reserves take into account anticipated recoveries for salvage and subrogation claims 

table of contents sensitivity analysis potential impact on reserve volatility due to changes in key assumptions our process to establish reserves includes a variety of key assumptions 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the following the selection of loss development factors  the weight to be applied to each individual actuarial indication  projected future loss trend  and expected ultimate loss ratios for the current accident year 
the importance of any single assumption depends on several considerations  such as the line of business and the accident year 
if the actual experience emerges differently than the assumptions used in the process to establish reserves  changes in our reserve estimate are possible and may be material to the results of operations in future periods 
set forth below is a discussion of the potential impact of using certain key assumptions that differ from those used in our latest reserve analysis 
it is important to note that the following discussion considers each assumption individually  without any consideration of correlation between lines of business and accident years  and therefore  does not constitute an actuarial range 
while the following discussion represents possible volatility from variations in key assumptions as identified by management  there is no assurance that the future emergence of our loss experience will be consistent with either our current or alternative set of assumptions 
by the very nature of the insurance business  loss development patterns have a certain amount of normal volatility 
workers compensation in addition to the normal amount of volatility  medical loss development factors for workers compensation are particularly sensitive to assumptions relating to medical inflation 
actual medical loss development factors could be significantly different than those which are selected from historical loss experience if actual medical inflation is materially different than what was observed in the past 
in our judgment  it is possible that actual medical loss development factors could range from below those actually selected in our latest reserve analysis to above those selected in our latest reserve analysis 
if the medical loss development assumptions were reduced by  that would decrease our indicated workers compensation reserves by approximately million for accident years and prior 
alternatively  if the medical loss development factors were increased by  that would increase our indicated workers compensation reserves by approximately million 
general liability in addition to the normal amount of volatility  general liability loss development factors have greater uncertainty due to the complexity of the coverages and the possibly significant periods of time that can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
in our judgment  it is possible that general liability loss development factors could be from those actually selected in our latest reserve analysis 
if the loss development assumptions were changed by  that would increase decrease our indicated general liability reserves by approximately million for accident years and prior 
commercial automobile in addition to the normal amount of volatility  the commercial automobile line of business of the company has experienced significant favorable development in recent years 
this favorable development has been driven in large part by a reduction in our bodily injury large loss experience 
the actual number of large claims has a high degree of volatility from year to year  and therefore  requires a longer period of time before a company would respond to this type of information 
under these circumstances  the difference between a traditional loss development method and the expected ultimate loss ratio is larger than usually expected 
for this reason the weight to be applied to each individual actuarial indication in this situation is another key assumption 
if the impact of changing the weights to be applied to each actuarial indication is combined with the impact of possible changes to selected loss development factors of  it is our judgment that the possible impact to overall reserves could range from approximately million reduction to approximately million increase for accident years and prior 
personal automobile in addition to the normal amount of volatility  the uncertainty of personal automobile loss development factors is greater than usual due to the number of judicial and regulatory changes in the new jersey personal automobile market over the years 
in our judgment  it is possible that personal auto bodily injury loss development factors could range from below those actually selected in our latest reserve analysis to above those selected in our latest reserve analysis 
if the loss development assumptions were reduced by  that would decrease our indicated personal automobile reserves by 
table of contents approximately million for accident years and prior 
alternatively  if the loss development factors were increased by  that would increase our indicated personal automobile reserves by approximately million 
current accident year for the accident year  the expected ultimate loss ratio by line of business is a key assumption 
this assumption is based upon a large number of inputs that are assessed periodically  such as historical loss ratios  projected future loss trend  and planned pricing amounts 
in our judgment  it is possible that the actual ultimate loss ratio for the accident year could be from the one selected in our latest reserve analysis for each of our four major long tailed lines of business 
the table below summarizes the possible impact on our reserves of varying our expected loss ratio assumption by by line of business for the accident year 
reserve impact of changing current year expected ultimate loss ratio assumption if assumption if assumption was reduced was raised in millions by by workers compensation general liability commercial automobile liability personal automobile liability prior year reserve development in in light of the many uncertainties associated with establishing the estimates and making the assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  the company reviews its reserve estimates on a regular basis as described above and makes adjustments in the period that the need for such adjustment is determined 
these reviews could result in the company identifying information and trends that would require the company to increase some reserves and or decrease other reserves for prior periods and could also lead to additional increases in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  which could materially adversely affect the company s results of operations  equity  business  insurer financial strength  and debt ratings 
the company experienced positive prior year development in its loss and loss expense reserves totaling million in  adverse prior year development of million in and adverse prior year development of million in for further discussion on the adverse development in loss and loss expense reserves  see the discussion on net loss and loss expense reserves in item business and note of
