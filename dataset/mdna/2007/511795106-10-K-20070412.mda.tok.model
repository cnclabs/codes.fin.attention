item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k and annual report and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this form k 
this document may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview we manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of safety garments and accessories for the industrial protective clothing market 
our products are sold by our in house sales force and independent sales representatives to a network of over safety and mill supply distributors 
these distributors in turn supply end user industrial customers such as chemical petrochemical  automobile  steel  glass  construction  smelting  janitorial  pharmaceutical and high technology electronics manufacturers  as well as hospitals and laboratories 
in addition  we supply federal  state and local governmental agencies and departments such as fire and police departments  airport crash rescue units  the department of defense  the department of homeland security and the centers for disease control 
our net sales attributable to customers outside the united states were million  million and million  in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our sales of limited use disposable protective clothing grew approximately in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  subsequent to january   we have seen a strong competitive push in the marketplace for disposable protective clothing  with a large competitor offering an aggressive rebate program 
we are meeting competitive offers with the help of support from a large supplier 
we expect to lose a modest amount of our volume in this area with only a moderate net effect on our ultimate margins 
our cost of goods sold will be further impacted by an approximately two month s supply of material purchased earlier in fy with no rebates 
we estimate this material will be charged to our cost of goods sold under strict fifo accounting at the end of q and the beginning of q  after which we expect to have a smooth flow of material costs 
we expect that distributors will continue to stock inventory at historical levels as economic conditions in the united states continue to remain slightly positive 
in addition  our net sales are driven in part by government funding and health related events 
our net sales attributable to chemical suits decreased in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  these sales decreases were due primarily to a lull in government 
index spending utilizing fire act monies and delays by state and local governmental purchasers in spending their bio terrorism monies 
these governmental sales are driven primarily by grants from the federal government under the fire act of and the bio terrorism preparedness and response act of as part of the homeland security initiatives 
during fiscal  as a result of the sars virus outbreak in various cities in  we sold approximately million of sars related garments in china  toronto  hong kong and taiwan 
the centers for disease control has recommended protective garments be used to protect healthcare workers in the fight against the spread of the sars virus and the avian flu 
in the event of future outbreaks of sars or other similar contagious viruses  such as avian flu in  we have positioned ourselves with increased production capacity 
we have operated manufacturing facilities in mexico since and in china since beginning in  we moved the labor intensive sewing operation for our limited use disposable protective clothing lines to these facilities 
our facilities and capabilities in china and mexico allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the united states and permit us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than they are available domestically 
as we have increasingly moved production of our products to our facilities in mexico and china  we have seen improvements in the profit margins for these products 
we are close to completion of moving the production of our reusable woven garments and gloves to these facilities and expect to complete this process by the fourth quarter of fiscal as a result  we expect to see profit margin improvements for these product lines as well 
the company has decided to restructure its manufacturing operations in mexico  by closing its current facilities in celaya and opening new facilities in jerez 
the company estimates the costs to close  move and start up will aggregate approximately  pretax 
this restructuring will allow for lower occupancy and labor costs and a more efficient production configuration 
the company anticipates this cost will be charged to its first quarter fy results critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base estimates on our past experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we periodically evaluate these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our sales primarily from our limited use disposable protective clothing and secondarily from our sales of high end chemical protective suits  fire fighting and heat protective apparel  gloves and arm guards  and reusable woven garments 
sales are recognized when goods are shipped to our distributors at which time title and the risk of loss passes 
sales are reduced for sales returns and allowances 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days for international sales 
inventories 
inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for accounts receivable that may not be collectible 
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the collectibility of individual large or past due accounts customer by customer 
we establish reserves for accounts that we determine to be doubtful of collection 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences  together with net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on our balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination 

index valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are assessed for impairment annually and upon occurrence of an event that indicates impairment may have occurred 
goodwill impairment is evaluated utilizing a two step process as required by sfas no 
factors that we consider important that could identify a potential impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon one or more of these indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method 
estimating future cash flows requires our management to make projections that can differ materially from actual results 
in august we purchased mifflin valley  a manufacturing facility in pennsylvania 
this purchase resulted in the recording of  in goodwill as of january  self insured liabilities 
we have a self insurance program for certain employee health benefits 
the cost of such benefits is recognized as expense based on claims filed in each reporting period and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported during such period 
our estimate of claims incurred but not reported is based upon historical trends 
if more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increases beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
we maintain separate insurance to cover the excess liability over set single claim amounts and aggregate annual claim amounts 
results of operations the following table set forth our historical results of operations for the years ended january   and as a percentage of our net sales 
year ended january  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating profit interest expense  net minority interest in net income of variable interest entities income tax expense net income significant balance sheet fluctuation january  as compared to january  balance sheet accounts 
the increase in cash and cash equivalents of million and the decrease in borrowings of million under the revolving credit agreement is principally due to the decrease in inventories of million as we restructured purchasing of raw materials from our major supplier 
we had built raw material reserves due to an anticipated increase in the cost of these raw materials 
accounts receivable increased million due to increased january sales 
plant property and equipment increased as a result of purchasing million of facilities in india in november year ended january  compared to the year ended january  net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the increase was due primarily to an increase in the sales by our new foreign subsidiaries and the acquisition of mifflin valley in july increased sales were offset by a slowing us economy which decreased demand for our products  particularly in the industrial non woven disposable markets we serve  and decreased demand for our chemical protective suits and fire turnout gear for homeland security purposes 
gross profit 
gross profit increased 
million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percent of net sales held steady at 
index for the year ended january  and for the year ended january   primarily because of cost reductions achieved by shifting production of additional tyvek based products and chemical suits to china and mexico and changes in the mix resulting from sales of the higher margin chemical suits while incurring costs related to the new facilities in india  chile and japan 
we have increasingly shifted and will continue to shift production to these lower cost facilities 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  as a percent of net sales  operating expenses increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  the million increase in operating expenses in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was principally due to increases in o million of mifflin valley operating expenses included for the full twelve months ended january in excess of the seven months through january included in the year ended january o million of labor costs resulting from personnel reassigned to sga departments and vacation accruals which had been assigned to cogs departments in the prior fiscal year

income tax expense decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  our effective tax rate was and for the year ended january  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate varied from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to lower foreign tax rates and that the prior year included million repatriation in china subsidiary profits and a reserve of  covering a portion of irs audit claims  the resolution of which cannot be determined at this time 
net income 
net income decreased million or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the decrease in net income was the result of an increase in expenses related to the new foreign facilities in india  chile  japan and a decrease in profit by the domestic operations 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  
index net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the increase was due primarily to an increase in the sales in our core non woven disposable products line and secondarily by our fire and glove lines respectively 
increased sales were also driven by an improving us and canadian economy which increased demand for our products  particularly in the industrial non woven disposable markets we serve  the acquisition of mifflin valley  inc in july  offset by decreased demand for our chemical protective suits for homeland security purposes which decreased month over month from february to october but then started increasing from november to our fiscal year ended january  gross profit 
gross profit increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january   primarily because of cost reductions achieved by shifting production of additional tyvek based products and chemical suits to china and mexico and changes in product mix

million for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  because of decreased borrowings and interest rates 
other income net 
other income net increased million principally as a result of the settlement by the company as plaintiff for million of an outstanding litigation involving two former employees of the company 
minority interest 
minority interest in net income of variable interest entities decreased by 
million for the year ended january  as a result of our adoption on financial interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  effective february  and then our purchasing such properties in fiscal year subsequent to our adoption of fin r  we determined that certain entities from which we lease real property and which are partially owned by related parties are variable interest entities governed by fin r 
as a result  these 
index entities were consolidated in our statement of income for the year ended january  these facilities were purchased in april and may thereby negating the recording of variable interest entities in fiscal income tax expense 
income tax expenses consist of federal  state and foreign income taxes 
income tax expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  our effective tax rate was and for the years ended january  and  respectively 
our effective tax rate increased from the federal statutory rate of due primarily to the repatriation of million in profits from our chinese subsidiaries and a reserve of  covering the portion of the claims of the irs which can be determined due to a recent audit 
the resolution of their claims cannot be determined at this time 
net income 
net income increased million or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase in net income was the result of an increase in net sales and productivity as a result of shifts in production to our china facilities  partially offset by an increase in costs and expenses due to higher sales and increases in our tax rates as mentioned above 
liquidity and capital resources management measures our liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short term and long term operational funding needs and fund additional investments  including acquisitions 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital under satisfactory terms 
internal cash generation  together with currently available cash and investment and an ability to access credit lines if needed are expected to be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  and any increase in working capital that we would need to accommodate a higher level of business activity 
we are actively seeking to expand by acquisitions as well as through organic growth of our business 
while a significant acquisition may require additional borrowings  equity financing or both  we believe that we would be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms based  among other things  on our earnings performance and current financial position 
cashflows as of january  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million  an increase and decrease of 
million and million  respectively  from january  our primary sources of funds for conducting our business activities have been from cash flow provided by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities described below 
we require liquidity and working capital primarily to fund increases in inventories and accounts receivable associated with our net sales and  to a lesser extent  for capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended january  was due primarily to net income from operations of million  and a decrease in inventories of million  offset by an increase in accounts receivable of 
million 
net cash used in operating activities of million for the year ended january  was due primarily to net income from operations of million offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable of million  an increase in inventories of million and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in investing activities of million and million in the years ended january  and  respectively  was due to purchases of real estate  property and equipment and the acquisitions of the india facility current year and mifflin valley prior year 
net cash used in and provided by financing activities in the years ended january  and was primarily attributable to a decreased and increased borrowing under our credit facilities  respectively 
creditfacilities we currently have one credit facility a five year  million revolving credit facility  of which we had borrowings outstanding as of january  amounting to million 
index our million revolving credit facility permits us to borrow up to the lower of million and a borrowing base determined by reference to a percentage of our eligible accounts receivable and inventory 
our million revolving credit facility expires on july  borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offering rate libor plus basis points and were at january  as of january   we had million of borrowing availability under this revolving credit facility 
our credit facility requires that we comply with specified financial covenants relating to interest coverage  debt coverage  minimum consolidated net worth  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these restrictive covenants could affect our financial and operational flexibility or impede our ability to operate or expand our business 
default under our credit facilities would allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
our lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit facilities 
we believe that our current cash position of million  our cash flow from operations along with borrowing availability under our million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated operating  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
capitalexpenditures our capital expenditures principally relate to purchases of manufacturing equipment  computer equipment  leasehold improvement and automobiles  as well as payments related to the construction of our facilities in china 
our facilities in china are not encumbered by commercial bank mortgages and thus chinese commercial mortgage loans may be available with respect to these real estate assets if we need additional liquidity 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million to purchase our capital equipment primarily computer equipment and apparel manufacturing equipment and approximately million for a new facility in canada in fiscal contractual obligations we had no off balance sheet arrangements at january  as shown below  at january   our contractual cash obligations totaled approximately million  including lease renewals entered into subsequent to january  payments due by period total less than year years years after years canada facility construction operating leases revolving credit facility total seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in february  march  april and may when scheduled maintenance occurs on nuclear  coal  oil and gas fired utilities  chemical  petrochemical and smelting facilities  and other heavy industrial manufacturing plants  primarily due to cooler temperatures 
sales decline during the warmer summer and vacation months  and generally increase from labor day through february with slight declines during holidays 
as a result of this seasonality in our sales  we have historically experienced a corresponding seasonality in our working capital  specifically inventories  with peak inventories occurring between september and march coinciding with lead times required to accommodate the spring maintenance schedules 
we believe that by sustaining higher levels of inventory  we gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
certain of our large customers seek sole sourcing to avoid sourcing their requirements from multiple vendors whose prices  delivery times and quality standards differ 
in recent years  due to increased demand by first responders for our chemical suits and fire gear  our historical seasonal pattern has shifted 
governmental disbursements are dependent upon budgetary processes and grant administration processes that do not follow our traditional seasonal sales patterns 
due to the size and timing of these 
index governmental orders  our net sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between different reporting periods 
as a result  we expect to experience increased variability in net sales  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
effects of recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 

fin no 
clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin no 
prescribes a two step process to determine the amount of tax benefit to be recognized 
first  the tax position must be evaluated to determine the likelihood that it will be sustained upon external examination 
if the tax position is deemed more likely than not to be sustained  the tax position is then assessed to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the amount of the benefit that may be recognized is the largest amount that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
we are required to adopt fin no 
effective as of february  we are currently evaluating the effect fin no 
will have on our financial statement 
we do not expect the impact will be material 
in september  the fasb issued fas no 
 fair value measurements fas no 
 which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under generally accepted accounting principles 
fas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
fas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  and should be applied prospectively  except in the case of a limited number of financial instruments that require retrospective application 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of fas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued fas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fas fas no 

the new statement allows entities to choose  at specified election dates  to measure eligible financial assets and liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value 
if a company elects the fair value option for an eligible item  changes in that item s fair value in subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings 
fas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating the potential impact of fas no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab provides interpretive guidance on how the effects of the carryover or reversal of prior year misstatements should be considered in quantifying a current year misstatement 
the sec staff believes that registrants should quantify errors using both a balance sheet and an income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in quantifying a misstatement that  when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered  is material 
sab is effective for the company s fiscal year ending january  the application of sab did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations as of january  or for the year then ended 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates 
to manage the volatility relating to these exposures  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases 
foreign currency risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our purchases and sales in other countries 
to manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases and sales 
in connection with our operations in china  we purchase a significant amount of products from outside of the united states 
however  our purchases in china are primarily made in chinese yuan  the value of which has been 
index largely pegged to the us dollar for the last decade 
however  the chinese yuan has recently been decoupled from the us dollar and allowed to float by the chinese government  and therefore  we will be exposed to additional foreign exchange rate risk on our chinese purchases 
our primary risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes is presently related to non us dollar denominated sales in canada and  to a smaller extent  in europe 
our sales to customers in canada are denominated in canadian dollars 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the canadian dollar  then our net sales could decrease as our products would be more expensive to our canadian customers because of the exchange rate change 
our sales in china are denominated in the chinese yuan  however  our sales there are presently not material 
at this time  we do not manage the foreign currency risk through the use of derivative instruments 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the landed costs into the us but would make our selling price for international sales more attractive with respect to foreign currencies 
as non us dollar denominated international purchases and sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our credit facilities  which have variable interest rates based upon the london interbank offered rate 
at january   we had million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
if the interest rate applicable to this variable rate debt rose in the year ended january   our interest expense would have increased and our income before income taxes would have decreased by less than  
index
