item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion reflects our historical results of operations  which do not include results from the  mtpy expansion capacity of nordural that was completed in the fourth quarter of  our ownership of nordural until acquired in late april  and  our ownership interest in the gramercy assets until acquired in october accordingly  the results for fiscal years and are not fully comparable to the results of operations for fiscal year our historical results are not indicative of our current business 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
overview we produce primary aluminum 
the aluminum industry is cyclical and the price of primary aluminum which trades as a commodity is determined by global supply and demand 
the key determinants of our results of operations and cash flow from operations are as follows our selling price is based on the lme and us midwest prices of primary aluminum and fixed price sales contracts 
our facilities operate at or near capacity  and fluctuations in volume  other than through acquisitions  generally are small 
the principal components of cost of goods sold are alumina  electrical power  and labor  which in aggregate were in excess of of the cost of goods sold 
many of these costs are covered by long term contracts  as described below 
shipment volumes  average realized price and cost of goods sold per pound shipped are our key performance indicators 
revenue can vary significantly from period to period due to fluctuations in the lme and midwest price of primary aluminum 
any adverse changes in the conditions that affect shipment volumes or the market price of primary aluminum could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows 
revenue is also impacted by our hedging activities 
fluctuations in working capital are influenced by shipments  the lme and midwest price of primary aluminum and by the timing of cash receipts and disbursements from major customers and suppliers 
cost of goods sold  excluding alumina and energy costs  is expected to remain relatively stable because our facilities generally operate near capacity and our major cost drivers are covered by long term contracts 
fluctuations in the cost of alumina in our us facilities are expected as the pricing in these contracts is variable and except for the gramercy alumina contract  is based on lme prices 
power contracts for our us facilities primarily provide for fixed priced power through  subject to adjustments for fuel costs in mt 
holly and possible adjustments in tariff rates in ravenswood 
approximately of hawesville s power requirements mw are unpriced beginning in through we have negotiated short term contracts to cover this requirement through at approximately market prices 
we are currently reviewing our options for pricing the unpriced power in through we are working with big rivers electric corporation and kenergy corporation on a proposal that would restructure and extend hawesville s existing power supply contract from through we expect power rates for the unpriced power to be significantly higher than the rates paid under our current long term power contracts 
effective july   the public service commission for the state of west virginia approved an experimental rate design in conjunction with an increase in the applicable tariff rates 
under the experimental rate  ravenswood may be excused from or may defer the payment of the increase in the tariff rate if aluminum prices as quoted on the lme fall below pre determined levels 
power contract pricing for nordural is variable and based on lme prices 
in  we entered into lme based  long term alumina contracts for the supply of alumina to our ravenswood and mt 
holly facilities beginning in january and expiring at the end of and  respectively 
these contracts were negotiated during a period of tight supply in the alumina market and as a result  the lme pricing in our new alumina contracts will be higher than under the contracts they replaced 
labor agreements with the united steelworkers of america at our hawesville and ravenswood facilities were ratified in and will expire in and  respectively 
through our ownership of ravenswood  hawesville and nordural  and our ownership interest in mt 
holly  we have an annual rated production capacity of approximately  metric tons of primary aluminum 
our annual production capacity should increase to  metric tons by the end of as a result of expansions at nordural

table of contents recent developments reservoir water levels on the cumberland river may impact hawesville s power costs in february  we were informed that the corps of engineers coe is planning to lower water levels in reservoirs on the cumberland river for repair and maintenance 
this will reduce electrical production from the dams of these reservoirs that were expected to provide a portion of the electrical power we purchase from big rivers electrical corp 
for the use by our hawesville facility during based on current expectations of reservoir levels  we expect any impact to be limited to the summer months  when usage rates on the big rivers system are at peak consumption 
based on our most recent information from the coe  we expect this to affect only approximately of hawesville s load requirements during this period 
we are exploring alternative sources of energy during the summer period 
we may have to pay a premium over and above our power contracts for this energy 
based on the current market for electrical power  we don t expect the premium to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operation or liquidity 
republic of the congo aluminum venture memorandum of understanding signed in february  we signed a memorandum of understanding mou with the republic of the congo roc for the exclusive right to develop an integrated aluminum business in the roc consisting of an aluminum smelter  an alumina refinery and a bauxite mine 
the mou is subject to satisfaction of certain conditions and the project that it contemplates is in the early stages of feasibility study and review 
the roc port area of pointe noire has been identified as a potential site for the aluminum smelter and alumina refinery 
the location of the bauxite mine is dependent upon a future assessment and mapping of the roc bauxite reserves 
the mou specifies that the government of roc will provide a minimum commitment of mw of gas generated electrical energy to the facility 
anode supplier declares force majeure on february   the anode supplier for nordural s  mtpy expansion  alcan trading ltd  declared a force majeure due to delays in their raw material supply 
the reduction in anode deliveries is not expected to have a significant impact on operations in the near term 
however  a prolonged shortage could deplete nordural s inventory which could significantly impact nordural s future operations 
alcan trading has informed us that they expect anode delivery schedules to return to normal in april helguvik power memorandum of understanding signed in june  nordural signed a mou to purchase electrical energy with two major icelandic geothermal power producers  hitaveita sudurnesja hs and orkuveita reykjavikur or 
under the mou  power will be supplied to the planned helguvik facility in stages  beginning with an initial phase of up to mw  which will support production capacity of up to  mtpy 
hs will provide up to mw in this initial stage  and or will supply up to mw 
electricity delivery for this first phase is targeted for the mou provides for a total of mw  which will ultimately provide power for a  mtpy facility 
the mou is subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions  including conditions relating to environmental licensing and the construction of the new facility 
it is our intention to sign an electrical energy agreement in helguvik harbor and site agreements in april  in furtherance of a joint action plan to evaluate the possible construction of a new aluminum smelter in the vicinity of helguvik  iceland  approximately miles from the city of reykjavik  we signed a harbor and site agreement with the reykjanesbaer municipal council  the gardur municipal council and the reykjanes harbour board

labor agreement with uswa at hawesville ratified in may  our hawesville  kentucky plant employees represented by the united steelworkers of america uswa ratified a four year collective bargaining agreement that will extend through march  the agreement covers approximately hourly workers at the hawesville plant 
labor agreement with uswa at ravenswood ratified on august   the membership of the uswa local voted to ratify a three year labor agreement covering the hourly workers at the ravenswood facility 
potline shutdown and restart at ravenswood on july   we received a hour notice of termination of extension agreement and intent to strike the employer from the uswa  which represents the hourly workers at the ravenswood facility 
based on the uswa s notice to strike  we completed an orderly shut down of one of the four potlines at the ravenswood facility 
following the ratification of the labor contract on august   we began the process of restarting the affected potline 
as of december   ravenswood reached full production on that line and in the plant 
as a result of the strike notice and subsequent potline shutdown at ravenswood  on august   we delivered force majeure notices to alcan and glencore and  pursuant to these notices  reduced deliveries under the alcan metal agreement and the glencore metal agreement ii 
on november   we rescinded the force majeure notices and have resumed full deliveries under these contracts 
joint venture with minmetals aluminum company in may  we entered into a joint venture agreement with minmetals aluminum company to explore the potential of developing a bauxite mine and associated million mtpy alumina refining facility in jamaica 
the first stage of the project  a pre feasibility stage  will assess the quality and quantity of bauxite reserves 
this stage is expected to take up to months 
if this stage is successful  a full feasibility study would follow 
the parties estimate that the mine and alumina refinery could be operational within three years following the completion of the full feasibility study

we have not designated the glencore metal agreement i as normal because it replaced and substituted for a significant portion of a sales contract which did not qualify for this designation 
because the glencore metal agreement i is variably priced  we do not expect significant variability in its fair value  other than changes that might result from the absence of the us midwest premium 
we account for the glencore metal agreement ii as a derivative instrument under sfas no 
under the glencore metal agreement ii  pricing is based on then current market prices  adjusted by a negotiated us midwest premium with a cap and a floor as applied to the current us midwest premium

nordural entered into a year lme based alumina tolling agreement with glencore for  metric tons of the expansion capacity at nordural 
deliveries under this agreement started in july in december  glencore assigned to hydro of its tolling rights under this agreement for the period to nordural consented to the assignment 
nordural s tolling revenues include a premium based on the european union eu import duty for primary aluminum 
the european commission has considered and is currently considering various proposals that would phase out this import duty 
while the import duty remains intact to date  any decrease in the eu import duty will negatively impact nordural s revenue

table of contents labor agreements our labor costs at ravenswood and hawesville are subject to the terms of labor contracts which generally have provisions for annual fixed increases in hourly wages and benefits adjustments 
the five labor unions represented at nordural operate under a labor contract that establishes wages and work rules for covered employees

ann jamaican labor unions through april  st 
ann has two labor unions  the university and allied workers union the uawu and the union of technical and supervisory personnel the utasp 
the uawu labor agreement will expire on april  on february   the utasp agreed to a labor contract that will expire on december  application of critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of the financial statements requires that management make subjective estimates  assumptions and judgments in applying these accounting policies 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience about past and current events and on assumptions about future events 
critical accounting estimates require management to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate and a change in these estimates may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial position or results of operations 
significant judgments and estimates made by our management include expenses and liabilities related to pensions and other postemployment benefits and forward delivery contracts and financial instruments 
pension and other postemployment benefit liabilities we sponsor various pension plans and also participate in a union sponsored multi employer pension plan for the collective bargaining unit employees at hawesville 
the liabilities and annual income or expense of our pension and other postemployment benefit plans are determined using methodologies that involve several actuarial assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate and the long term rate of asset return 
in developing our expected long term rate of return assumption for pension fund assets  we evaluated input from our actuaries  including their review of asset class return expectations as well as long term inflation assumptions 
projected returns are based on historical returns of broad equity and bond indices 
we also considered our historical year compound returns 
we anticipate that our pension investments will generate long term rates of return of 
our expected long term rate of return is based on an assumed asset allocation of equity funds and fixed income funds 
discount rate selection it is our policy to select a discount rate for purposes of measuring obligations under the pension and retiree medical plans by matching cash flows separately for each plan to yields on zero coupon bonds 
we use the citigroup pension liability index for determining these yields 
the citigroup pension liability index was specifically developed to meet the criteria set forth in paragraph of sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the published information at the end of each calendar month includes spot rate yields zero coupon bond yield estimates in half year increments for use in tailoring a discount rate to a particular plan s projected benefit cash flows 
the citigroup pension liability index rate represents the discount rate developed from these spot rate yields  based on the pattern and duration of the benefit payments of a typical  large  somewhat mature pension plan 

table of contents 
table of contents the individual characteristics of each plan  including projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  have been taken into account  since discount rates are determined on a plan by plan basis 
we will generally select a discount rate rounded to the nearest  unless specific circumstances provide for a more appropriate non rounded rate to be used 
we believe the projected cash flows used to determine the citigroup pension liability index rate provide a good approximation of the timing and amounts of our defined benefits payments under our plans and no adjustment to the citigroup pension liability index rate has been made 
therefore  as of december   century selected a discount rate of for all of the pension and post employment benefit plans and for our worker s compensation plans 
although the duration of the supplemental executive retirement benefits serb plan is slightly shorter than our other pension plans  century aluminum will also use a discount rate for this plan  because we do not believe that the difference in duration is significant  and because the obligations of the serb are small in comparison to the other plans  we believe that the disclosure of a single rate that was used for the majority of the obligations will enhance the reader s understanding of the employee benefit footnote  rather than a weighted average rate that may complicate any determinations the reader may have 
lowering the expected long term rate of return by from to would have increased our pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
lowering the discount rate assumptions by would have increased our pension expense for the year ended december  by approximately million 
century provides postemployment benefit plans that provide health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all retired employees of our us based operations 
sfas no 
requires the accrual of the estimated cost of providing postretirement benefits during the working careers of those employees who could become eligible for such benefits when they retire 
we fund these benefits as the retirees submit claims 
measurement of our postretirement benefit obligations requires the use of several assumptions about factors that will affect the amount and timing of future benefit payments 
the assumed health care cost trend rates are the most critical assumptions for measurement of the postretirement benefits obligation 
changes in the health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the health care benefit obligations 
century assumes medical inflation is initially  declining to over six years and thereafter 
a one percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effects in one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease in thousands effect on total of service and interest cost components effect on accumulated postretirement benefit obligation forward delivery contracts and financial instruments estimating the fair value of certain of our forward financial and physical delivery contracts requires us to make assumptions about future market prices of primary aluminum and the us midwest premium 
we routinely enter into market priced physical and fixed priced financial contracts for the sale of primary aluminum and the purchase of raw materials in future periods 
we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  in accounting for these types of contracts 
we have fixed price financial contracts for the sale of primary aluminum with settlement dates through  but the lme futures quotes run through determining the fair value of these forward contracts requires us to make certain assumptions about future market prices of primary aluminum beyond the quoted future market prices in in addition  our glencore metal agreement ii forward physical sales contract is accounted for as derivative and contains pricing provisions based on the us midwest market price of primary aluminum 
because there is no quoted futures market price for the us midwest premium component of the market price for primary aluminum  it is necessary for us to estimate the us midwest premium for future periods 
for those physical delivery contracts which management believes are probable of future delivery  such contracts are classified as normal purchases and normal sales and are not accounted for as derivatives 

table of contents 
table of contents the aluminum based financial and physical delivery contracts that are derivatives and do not qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception  as provided for in current accounting standards  are marked to market using the lme spot and forward market for primary aluminum 
for derivative contracts extending beyond the quoted lme market periods  we estimate the forward lme market price beyond the quoted periods based upon market price trends in the final months of the quoted lme market 
we estimate the us midwest premium by using third party expectations for future us midwest premiums  when available 
third party estimates rarely extend beyond months 
for periods beyond the third party information  we estimate the us midwest premium by using its year rolling average 
fluctuations in the lme price of primary aluminum and us midwest premium have a significant impact on gains and losses included in our financial statements from period to period 
unrealized gains and losses are either included in other comprehensive income loss for cash flow hedges or net gain loss on forward contracts for derivative instruments  depending on criteria as provided for in the accounting standards 
the forward natural gas purchase contracts are marked to market using the nymex spot and forward market for natural gas 
fluctuations in the nymex price of natural gas can have an impact on other comprehensive income in our financial statements from period to period 
we have designated these forward contracts as cash flow hedges for forecasted natural gas transactions in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
as amended 
we assess the effectiveness of these cash flow hedges quarterly 
the effective portion of the gains and losses are recorded in other comprehensive income loss and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
the principal contracts affected by these standards and the resulting effects on the financial statements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included herein

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and nordural s term loan facility

we have not determined the sources of funding for our long term debt repayment requirements  however  we believe that our cash flow from operations  available borrowing under our revolving credit facility and  to the extent necessary and or economically attractive  future financial market activities will be adequate to address our long term liquidity requirements 
our principal uses of cash are operating costs  payments of interest on our outstanding debt  the funding of capital expenditures and investments in related businesses  working capital and other general corporate requirements

for example  the convertible senior notes are classified as current because they may be converted by the holder at any time 
our adjusted working capital increased during primarily due to higher market prices for primary aluminum  which drove increases in accounts receivable  inventory and cash 
this increase was offset somewhat by increases in our current due to affiliates and current portion of long term debt

we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately to million in  exclusive of costs associated with nordural s expansion to  mtpy phase iv and nordural s phase v expansion 
we expect the nordural expansion projects will require approximately million of capital expenditures in through december   we had outstanding capital commitments related to the nordural expansion of million related to phase iv and phase v expansion projects 
we expect to incur approximately to million in capital expenditures for the helguvik greenfield project in our cost commitments for the nordural expansion may materially change depending on the exchange rate between the us dollar and certain foreign currencies  principally the euro and the icelandic krona

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price sensitivity we are exposed to price risk for primary aluminum 
we manage our exposure to fluctuations in the price of primary aluminum by selling aluminum at fixed prices for future delivery and through financial instruments  as well as by purchasing certain of our alumina and power requirements under supply contracts with prices tied to the same indices as our aluminum sales contracts the lme price of primary aluminum 
our risk management activities do not include any trading or speculative transactions 
the following table shows our forward priced sales as a percentage of our estimated production capacity 
forward priced sales as of december  base volume pounds metric tons percent of capacity potential additional volume pounds metric tons percent of capacity the forward priced sales in exclude january shipments to customers that are priced based upon the prior month s market price 
certain financial contracts included in the forward priced sales base volume for the period through contain clauses that trigger potential additional sales volume when the market price for a contract month is above the base contract ceiling price 
these contacts will be settled monthly and  if the market price exceeds the ceiling price for all contract months through  the potential sales volume would be equivalent to the amounts shown above 
apart from the alcan metal agreement  glencore metal agreement i  glencore metal agreement ii and southwire metal agreement  we had forward delivery contracts to sell  metric tons and  metric tons of primary aluminum at december  and december   respectively 
of these forward delivery contracts  we had fixed price commitments to sell  metric tons and  metric tons of primary aluminum at december  and december   respectively  of which none were with glencore at december  and metric tons were with glencore at december  
table of contents 
table of contents financial sales agreements to mitigate the volatility in our unpriced forward delivery contracts  we enter into fixed price financial sales contracts  which settle in cash in the period corresponding to the intended delivery dates of the forward delivery contracts 
certain of these fixed price financial sales contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges depending on our designation of each contract at its inception 
glencore is our counterparty for all of these financial sales contracts 
substantially all of the contracts accounted for as derivatives contain clauses that trigger additional shipment volume when the market price for a contract month is above the contract ceiling price 
if the market price exceeds the ceiling price for all contract months through  the maximum additional shipment volume would be  metric tons 
these contracts will be settled monthly 
we had no fixed price financial contracts to purchase aluminum at december  or december  primary aluminum financial sales contracts as of metric tons december  december  cash flow hedges derivatives total cash flow hedges derivatives total total additionally  to mitigate the volatility of the natural gas markets  we enter into fixed price financial purchase contracts  accounted for as cash flow hedges  which settle in cash in the period corresponding to the intended usage of natural gas 
one decatherm dth is equivalent to one million british thermal units btu 
natural gas financial purchase contracts as of thousands of dth december  total on a hypothetical basis  a per metric ton increase in the market price of primary aluminum is estimated to have an unfavorable impact of million after tax on accumulated other comprehensive income for the contracts designated as cash flow hedges  and million on net income for the contracts designated as derivatives  for the period ended december  as a result of the forward primary aluminum financial sales contracts outstanding at december  on a hypothetical basis  a per dth decrease in the market price of natural gas is estimated to have an unfavorable impact of million after tax on accumulated other comprehensive income for the period ended december  as a result of the forward natural gas financial purchase contracts outstanding at december  
table of contents 
table of contents our metals and natural gas risk management activities are subject to the control and direction of senior management 
these activities are regularly reported to century s board of directors 
this quantification of our exposure to the commodity price of aluminum is necessarily limited  as it does not take into consideration our inventory or forward delivery contracts  or the offsetting impact on the sales price of primary aluminum products 
because all of our alumina contracts  except hawesville s alumina contract with gramercy  are indexed to the lme price for primary aluminum  they act as a natural hedge for approximately of our production 
as of december   approximately including  metric tons of potential additional volume under our derivative sales contracts of our production for was hedged by our lme based alumina contracts  nordural s electrical power and tolling contracts  and by fixed price forward delivery and financial sales contracts 
nordural 
substantially all of nordural s revenues are derived from toll conversion agreements with glencore  hydro and a subsidiary of bhp billiton ltd 
whereby nordural converts alumina provided by these companies into primary aluminum for a fee based on the lme price for primary aluminum 
nordural s lme based toll revenues are subject to the risk of decreases in the market price of primary aluminum  however  nordural is not exposed to increases in the price for alumina  the principal raw material used in the production of primary aluminum 
in addition  under its power contract  nordural purchases power at a rate which is a percentage of the lme price for primary aluminum  providing nordural with a natural hedge against downswings in the market for primary aluminum 
nordural s tolling revenues include a premium based on the exemption available to icelandic aluminum producers from the european union eu import duty for primary aluminum 
the european commission has considered and is currently considering various proposals that would phase out this import duty 
while the import duty remains intact to date  any decrease in the eu import duty will negatively impact nordural s revenue 
nordural is exposed to foreign currency risk due to fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the euro and the icelandic krona 
nordural s revenues and power costs are based on the lme price for primary aluminum  which is denominated in us dollars 
there is no currency risk associated with these contracts 
nordural s labor costs are denominated in icelandic krona and a portion of its anode costs are denominated in euros 
as a result  an increase or decrease in the value of those currencies relative to the us dollar would affect nordural s operating margins 
nordural does not currently have financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk 
nordural may hedge such risks in the future  including through the purchase of aluminum put options 
we have entered into currency options to mitigate a portion of our foreign currency exposure to the icelandic krona for the phase v expansion capital expenditures 
see the discussion in the capital resources section of item  management s discussion and analysis 
interest rates interest rate risk 
our primary debt obligations are the million of outstanding senior unsecured notes  million of outstanding convertible notes  million in industrial revenue bonds irbs  borrowings under our revolving credit facility  and the nordural debt  including million of borrowings under its term loan facility 
our senior unsecured notes and convertible notes bear a fixed rate of interest  so changes in interest rates do not subject us to changes in future interest expense with respect to these borrowings 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility are at variable rates at a margin over libor or the bank base rate  as defined in the credit agreement 
there were no outstanding borrowings on our revolving credit facility at december  the irbs bear interest at variable rates determined by reference to the interest rate of similar instruments in the industrial revenue bond market 
borrowings under nordural s term loan facility bear interest at a margin over the applicable eurodollar rate 
at december   we had million of variable rate borrowings 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the interest rate would increase our net loss by million  assuming no debt reduction 
we have not hedged our interest rate risk  but may do so in the future through interest rate swaps which would have the effect of fixing a portion of our floating rate debt 
our primary financial instruments are cash and short term investments  including cash in bank accounts and other highly rated liquid money market investments and government securities
