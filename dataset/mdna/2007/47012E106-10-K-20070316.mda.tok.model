item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of various factors 
you should read this section in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in item 
critical accounting policies the accompanying consolidated financial statements and supplementary information were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
significant accounting policies are discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  item inherent in the application of many of these accounting policies is the need for management to make estimates and judgments in the determination of certain revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities 
as such  materially different financial results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known 
the policies with the greatest potential effect on our results of operations and financial position include allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there were a deterioration of a major customer s creditworthiness  or actual defaults were higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be overstated  which could have an adverse impact on our operating results 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is significant because our revenue is a key component of our results of operations 
in addition  our revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
we follow very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenues  however  certain judgments affect the application of our revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net long lived assets  including goodwill  amounted to million as of december  reserve inventory obsolescence 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost or market 
we accrue a reserve for obsolete  slow moving inventory which is based on management s assessment of all relevant information 
we periodically review and adjust our assumptions as circumstances warrant 
income allocation for income taxes 
our income tax provision and related income tax assets and liabilities are based on actual income as allocated to the various tax jurisdictions based upon our transfer pricing study  us and foreign statutory income tax rates  and tax regulations and planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in interpreting tax regulations in the us and foreign jurisdictions  and in evaluating worldwide uncertain tax positions 
actual results could differ materiality from those judgments  and changes in judgments could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
we accrue a tax reserve for additional income taxes and interest  which may become payable in future years as a result of audit adjustments by tax authorities 
the reserve is based on management s assessment of all relevant information  and are periodically reviewed and adjusted as circumstances warrant 
as of december   our income tax reserves are approximately million and relate to the potential income tax audit adjustments  primarily in the areas of income allocation and transfer pricing 
share based payments 
we grant restricted stock and options to purchase our common stock to our employees including officers and non employee directors under our stock award and incentive plan the plan  which incorporated our third amended and restated stock option plan 
the benefits provided under the plan are share based payments subject to the provisions of revised statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment 
effective january   we began to use the fair value method to apply the provisions of sfas r with a modified prospective application 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards that were outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified  cancelled or became vested 
under the modified prospective application  prior periods are not restated for comparative purposes 
share based compensation expense recognized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period under sfas r for the year ended december  was million  relating to stock options  and million relating to restricted stock 
at december   total unrecognized estimated compensation expense related to non vested stock options granted prior to that date was million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years  and million related to non vested restricted stock  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
net stock options  after forfeitures and cancellations  granted during the year ended december  represented of outstanding shares as of december  there were no stock options granted in we estimate the value of share based awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the estimated value of each share based award was used for the pro forma information required to be disclosed under sfas the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  cancellations  terminations  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ from what we have recorded in the current period 
option pricing models were developed for use in estimating the value of traded options that have no vesting or hedging restrictions  are fully transferable and do not cause dilution 
because our share based payments have characteristics significantly different from those of freely traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect our estimates of fair values  in our opinion  existing valuation models  including the black scholes and lattice binomial models  may not provide reliable measures of the fair values of our share based compensation 
consequently  there is a risk that our estimates of the fair values of our share based compensation awards on the grant dates may differ from the actual values realized upon the exercise  expiration  early termination or forfeiture of those share based payments in the future 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
alternatively  value may be realized from these instruments that is significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with sfas r and the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
estimates of share based compensation expenses do have an impact on our financial statements  but these expenses are based on the aforementioned option valuation model and will never result in the payment of cash by us 
for this reason  and because we do not view share based compensation as related to our operational performance  we exclude estimated share based compensation expense when evaluating the business performance of our operating segments 
the guidance in sfas r and sab is relatively new  and best practices are not well established 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of share based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
furthermore  theoretical valuation models and market based methods are evolving and may result in lower or higher fair value estimates for share based compensation 
the timing  readiness  adoption  general acceptance  reliability and testing of these methods is uncertain 
sophisticated mathematical models may require voluminous historical information  modeling expertise  financial analyses  correlation analyses  integrated software and databases  consulting fees  customization and testing for adequacy of internal controls 
market based methods are emerging that  if employed by us  may dilute our earnings per share and involve significant transaction fees and ongoing administrative expenses 
the uncertainties and costs of these extensive valuation efforts may outweigh the benefits to investors 
recent developments on february   we acquired substantially all of the assets of creative designs international  ltd 
and a related hong kong company  arbor toys company limited collectively  creative designs

comparison of the years ended december  and net sales 
net sales were million in compared to million in  representing an increase of million or

as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of approximately million for which no allowance has been provided since  in the opinion of management  realization of the future benefit is probable 
in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act created a one time incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed earnings from their international subsidiaries by providing an dividends received deduction for certain international earnings 
the deduction was available to corporations during the tax year that included october  or in the immediately subsequent tax year 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a plan to repatriate million in foreign earnings  which was completed in december the federal and state income tax expense related to this repatriation was approximately million 
quarterly fluctuations and seasonality we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate these fluctuations in the future 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
our first quarter is typically expected to be the least profitable as a result of lower net sales but substantially similar fixed operating expenses 
this is consistent with the performance of many companies in the toy industry

recent accounting standards in july  the fasb issued final interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainly in income taxes  an interpretation of sfas  which clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing the minimum recognition threshold an uncertain tax position is required to meet before tax benefits associated with such uncertain tax position are recognized in the financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
in addition  fin excludes income taxes from the scope of sfas  accounting for contingencies 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  differences between the amounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets prior to the adoption of fin and the amounts reported after adoption are accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings upon adoption of fin fin also requires that amounts recognized in the balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions be classified as a current or non current liability  based upon the timing of the ultimate payment to a taxing authority 
we will adopt fin as of january  and are in the process of finalizing the effect fin will have on our financial statements 
under the guidance of fin  management estimates that our income tax reserve may increase by approximately million to million  which is subject to revision when management completes an analysis of the impact of fin as required by fin  upon adoption on january   this difference will be recorded in retained earnings as a cumulative effect adjustment 
in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements  which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
under sfas  fair value refers to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets and the lowest priority to unobservable data  for example  the reporting entity s own data 
fair value measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to reduce both the complexity in accounting for financial instruments and the volatility in earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently 
sfas is effective for us as of january  and we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our operating results or financial position 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of million  as compared to million as of december  this decrease was primarily attributable to cash used in connection with the acquisition of creative designs  partially offset by cash provided by our operating results 
operating activities provided net cash of million in the year ended december   as compared to million in net cash was provided primarily by net income of million  non cash charges and changes in working capital 
accounts receivable turnover as measured by days sales outstanding in accounts receivable increased from approximately days as of december  to approximately days as of december  primarily due to a shift in sales from fob china to domestic sales origin  which carry longer payment terms  and the timing of sales where a greater percentage of the last quarter sales occurred at the end of the quarter 
other than open purchase orders  issued in the normal course of business  we have no obligations to purchase finished goods from our manufacturers 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million 
our investing activities used cash of million in the year ended december   as compared to million in  consisting primarily of the purchase of office furniture and equipment and molds and tooling used in the manufacture of our products  and the goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of creative designs  plus the million in goodwill relating to the earn out of play along  million in goodwill relating to the earn out of pet pal and the purchase of marketable securities 
in  our investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase of molds and tooling used in the manufacture of our products and the goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in the acquisition of pet pal  plus the million in goodwill relating to the earn out of play along  partially offset by the sale of marketable securities of million 
as part of our strategy to develop and market new products  we have entered into various character and product licenses with royalties generally ranging from to payable on net sales of such products 
as of december   these agreements required future aggregate minimum guarantees of million  exclusive of million in advances already paid 
we do not have any significant capital expenditure commitments as of december  our financing activities provided net cash of million in the year ended december   as compared to million in in  cash was primarily provided from the exercise of stock options and the tax benefit from stock options exercised 
in  cash was primarily provided from the exercise of stock options 
the following is a summary of our significant contractual cash obligations for the periods indicated that existed as of december  and is based on information appearing in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in thousands thereafter total long term debt operating leases minimum guaranteed license royalty payments employment contracts total contractual cash obligations in october  the american jobs creation act of the act was signed into law 
the act created a one time incentive for us corporations to repatriate undistributed earnings from their international subsidiaries by providing an dividends received deduction for certain international earnings 
the deduction was available to corporations during the tax year that included october  or in the immediately subsequent tax year 
in the fourth quarter of  our board of directors approved a plan to repatriate million in foreign earnings  which was completed in december the federal and state income tax expense related to this repatriation was approximately million 
in june  we purchased substantially all of the assets and assumed certain liabilities of play along 
the total initial purchase price of million consisted of cash paid in the amount of million and the issuance of  shares of our common stock valued at million 
in addition  we agreed to pay an earn out of up to million per year for the four calendar years following the acquisition up to an aggregate amount of million based on the achievement of certain financial performance criteria which will be recorded as goodwill when and if earned 
for the three years in the period ended december   million  million and million  respectively  of the earn out was earned and recorded as goodwill 
accordingly  the maximum earn out remaining for the year ending december  is approximately million 
our results of operations have included play along from the date of acquisition 
in october  we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit commenced by wwe the wwe action 
the complaint also named as defendants  among others  the joint venture with thq inc  certain of our foreign subsidiaries and our three executive officers 
in november  several purported class action lawsuits were filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  alleging damages associated with the facts alleged in the wwe action 
three shareholder derivative actions have also been filed against us  nominally  and against certain of our board members the derivative actions 
the derivative actions seek to hold the individual defendants liable for damages allegedly caused to our company by their actions  and  in one of the derivative actions  seeks restitution to our company of profits  benefits and other compensation obtained by them 
in october  wwe commenced a lawsuit against thq and the joint venture concerning allegedly improper sales of wwe video games in japan and other countries in asia  seeking among other things  a declaration that wwe is entitled to terminate its video games license with the joint venture and monetary damages 
see legal proceedings 
in june  we purchased substantially all of the operating assets and assumed certain liabilities relating to the pet pal line of pet products  including toys  treats and related pet products 
the total initial purchase price of million was paid in cash 
in addition  we agreed to pay an earn out of up to an aggregate amount of million in cash over the three years ending june  following the acquisition based on the achievement of certain financial performance criteria  which will be recorded as goodwill when and if earned 
during the year ended december   million of the earn out was earned and recorded as goodwill 
goodwill of million arose from this transaction  which represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
this acquisition expands our product offerings and distribution channels 
our results of operations have included pet pal from the date of acquisition 
on february   we acquired substantially all of the assets of creative designs 
the total initial purchase price of million consisted of million in cash   shares of our common stock at a value of approximately million and the assumption of liabilities in the amount of million 
in addition  we agreed to pay an earn out of up to an aggregate amount of million in cash over the three calendar years following the acquisition based on the achievement of certain financial performance criteria  which will be recorded as goodwill when and if earned 
for the year ended december   million of the earn out was earned and recorded as goodwill 
creative designs is a leading designer and producer of dress up and role play toys and is included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
in june  we sold an aggregate of million of convertible senior notes due june  the notes may be converted into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of per share  or shares per note  subject to certain circumstances 
the notes may be converted in each quarter subsequent to any quarter in which the closing price of our common stock is at or above a prescribed price for at least trading days in the last trading day period of the quarter 
the prescribed price for the conversion trigger is through june   and increases nominally each quarter thereafter 
cash interest is payable at an annual rate of of the principal amount at issuance  from the issue date to june   payable on june and december of each year  commencing on december  after june   interest will accrue at the same rate on the outstanding notes until maturity 
at maturity  we will redeem the notes at their accreted principal amount  which will be equal to  per  principal amount at issuance  unless redeemed or converted earlier 
the notes were not convertible as of december  we may redeem the notes at our option in whole or in part beginning on june   at of their accreted principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  payable in cash 
holders of the notes may also require us to repurchase all or part of their notes on june   for cash  at a repurchase price of of the principal amount per note plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
holders of the notes may also require us to repurchase all or part of their notes on june  and june  at a repurchase price of of the accreted principal amount per note plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any 
any repurchases at june  and june  may be paid in cash  in shares of common stock or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
we believe that our cash flows from operations and cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements and provide us with adequate liquidity to meet our anticipated operating needs for at least the next months 
although operating activities are expected to provide cash  to the extent we grow significantly in the future  our operating and investing activities may use cash and  consequently  this growth may require us to obtain additional sources of financing 
there can be no assurance that any necessary additional financing will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
we intend to finance our long term liquidity requirements out of net cash provided by operations and cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
exchange rates sales from our united states and hong kong operations are denominated in us dollars and our manufacturing costs are denominated in either us or hong kong dollars 
operations and operating expenses of all of our operations are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the hong kong dollar or british pound us dollar exchange rate may positively or negatively affect our operating results 
the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we cannot assure you that the exchange rate between the united states and hong kong currencies will continue to be fixed or that exchange rate fluctuations between the united states and hong kong and united kingdom currencies will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position  results of operations or cash flows due to adverse changes in financial and commodity market prices and rates 
we are exposed to market risk in the areas of changes in united states and international borrowing rates and changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in addition  we are exposed to market risk in certain geographic areas that have experienced or remain vulnerable to an economic downturn  such as china 
we purchase substantially all of our inventory from companies in china  and  therefore  we are subject to the risk that such suppliers will be unable to provide inventory at competitive prices 
while we believe that  if such an event were to occur we would be able to find alternative sources of inventory at competitive prices  we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so 
these exposures are directly related to our normal operating and funding activities 
historically and as of december   we have not used derivative instruments or engaged in hedging activities to minimize our market risk 
interest rate risk in june  we issued convertible senior notes payable of million with a fixed interest rate of per annum  which remain outstanding as of december  accordingly  we are not generally subject to any direct risk of loss arising from changes in interest rates 
foreign currency risk we have wholly owned subsidiaries in hong kong and china 
sales are made by these operations on fob china or hong kong terms and are denominated in us dollars 
however  purchases of inventory and hong kong operating expenses are typically denominated in hong kong dollars and local operating expenses in china are denominated in local currency  thereby creating exposure to changes in exchange rates 
changes in the chinese yuan or hong kong dollar us dollar exchange rates may positively or negatively affect our gross margins  operating income and retained earnings 
a gain in hong kong dollars gave rise to the other comprehensive loss in the balance sheet at december  the exchange rate of the hong kong dollar to the us dollar has been fixed by the hong kong government since at hk to us and  accordingly  has not represented a currency exchange risk to the us dollar 
we do not believe that near term changes in these exchange rates  if any  will result in a material effect on our future earnings  fair values or cash flows  and therefore  we have chosen not to enter into foreign currency hedging transactions 
we cannot assure you that this approach will be successful  especially in the event of a significant and sudden change in the value of the hong kong dollar or chinese yuan
