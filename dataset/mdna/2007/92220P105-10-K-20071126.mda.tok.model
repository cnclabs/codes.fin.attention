item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in fiscal year  total revenues increased to billion and net orders increased to billion over fiscal year revenues 
fiscal year was a challenging year for oncology systems where net orders remained relatively flat in the first half of fiscal year and improved by in the second half of the fiscal year compared to the same periods of fiscal year for fiscal year  oncology systems revenues grew and net orders increased by from the prior year levels  primarily driven by growth in demand for igrt products 
both revenues and net orders in the x ray products segment increased by in fiscal year from primarily due to increased demand for our high power  anode grounded ct scanning tubes and flat panel detectors 
in fiscal year  our businesses in the other category grew revenues by and net orders by over fiscal year primarily due to contributions from our acquisitions of accel instruments gmbh  or accel  and strong growth in our sip business which includes the recently acquired bio imaging research  inc  or bir 
backlog at september   including accel and bir  was up to billion from the total at the end of the prior year 
net earnings per diluted share were in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year when we had a per diluted share benefit from discrete tax events and discontinued operations 
the acquisitions of accel and bir reduced net earnings per diluted share by for fiscal year oncology systems 
our largest business segment is oncology systems  which designs  manufacturers  sells and services hardware and software products for treating cancer with radiation  including linear accelerators  treatment simulation and verification products  brachytherapy equipment  information management and treatment planning software and other sophisticated accessory products and services 
in fiscal year  oncology systems reported a weak net order growth of in the first half of fiscal year over the same year ago period 
for the full fiscal year  total net orders grew over fiscal year with an increase in north america of and an increase in the international region of 
the increase in both the north american and international regions reflected continued growth in demand for igrt products and service contracts 
nearly all of our high energy accelerators ordered in north america and over of high energy accelerators ordered worldwide during fiscal year were ordered with our on board imager product  or obi  which enables igrt 
as of september   we had more than installations of obi on our high energy and trilogy accelerators  either complete or in progress 
however  the net order growth in fiscal year for igrt in both the north american and the international regions was significantly offset by declines in other product lines  including imrt upgrades and brachytherapy products 
since a portion of our orders are shipped within one year of the placement of the order  the weak net order growth in the first half of fiscal year  as well as customer requested delays for product deliveries  contributed to the lower growth in oncology systems revenues for fiscal year of over the prior year  with an increase in north american revenues of and an increase in international revenues of 
oncology systems revenue growth was primarily due to growth in our accessory products that enable igrt including our obi  our trilogy linear accelerators and service contracts  partially offset by declines in revenues from our high energy linear accelerators and other non igrt products such as imrt upgrades  simulators and brachytherapy products 
gross margin in fiscal year decreased by about percentage points from fiscal year due principally to the effect of hedging foreign currency denominated sales contracts when the orders were booked to protect the gross profit dollars 
while the weakening of the us dollar positively affected our revenues  it had a negative impact on our gross margin percentage 
we continue to believe that demand for our products that enable igrt will remain strong as north america has adopted igrt technology as a standard of care for radiation therapy and radiosurgery and 
table of contents the international regions have shown increased demand for igrt products 
since late fiscal year  our international regions have experienced a slowdown in demand for radiotherapy capital equipment for imrt after several years of strong international growth driven by the rapid adoption of imrt technology 
we believe regional fluctuations in demand are consistent with a historical pattern where the international regions and north america region have different cycles of demand and technology adoption 
we are  however  seeing a faster adoption rate among the technology early adopters for igrt as compared to imrt  which may lead to more compressed growth phase cycles 
also  we are seeing greater variability in the length of the customer purchasing cycle  which we believe results from a more complex decision making process associated with large dollar value of transactions for more sophisticated igrt and surgical equipment 
this also may result in greater fluctuation in our net orders and revenue results 
our success in oncology systems largely depends upon our ability to retain leadership in technological innovation  the cost effectiveness of our products  the efficacy of our treatment technology and external economic influences 
factors affecting the adoption rate of new technologies such as igrt could include more widely demonstrated efficacy of igrt and our internal efficiency in design  documentation and testing  deployment and installation 
they may also include customer training  reimbursement and our ability to educate customers about the cost effectiveness of our new technologies and clinical outcome advantages 
external economic influences could include hospital financial strength in the united states  foreign currency exchange rates  governmental healthcare policies  significant changes to medicare and medicaid reimbursement rates for radiotherapy procedures and government budgeting and tendering cycles 
x ray products 
our x ray products business segment manufactures and sells i x ray tubes for use in a range of applications including computed tomography  or ct  scanning  radioscopic fluoroscopic imaging  mammography  special procedures and industrial applications and ii flat panel digital image detectors for x rays commonly referred to as flat panel detectors or digital image detectors  which is an alternative to image intensifier tubes for fluoroscopy and x ray film for radiography 
in fiscal year  increased demand for our high power  anode grounded ct scanning tubes and flat panel detectors contributed to the solid net orders and revenues growth over fiscal year gross margin for this business segment also improved significantly driven by leverage from higher sales volume  product mix shift towards high margin products and cost reduction efforts 
we continued to make investments in the x ray products business 
we completed the expansion of our salt lake city  utah  facility where our flat panel product line is manufactured 
in addition  in fiscal years and  we invested million into dpix holding llc  or dpix holding  to help fund the acquisition and construction by dpix holding through its subsidiary  dpix llc of a new million gen fabrication facility in colorado where the next generation of amorphous silicon arrays will be produced 
dpix llc is a key supplier of amorphous silicon arrays for our flat panel detector products and we are a equity owner in dpix holding 
the colorado facility should be in production in the second half of our success in our x ray products business depends upon our ability to anticipate changes in our markets  the direction of technological innovation and the demands of our customers 
factors affecting the success of our x ray products business include our ability to develop products with lower cost  better quality and superior technology and performance  and to maintain strong relationships with our oem customers 
other 
the other category is comprised of our sip business including bir  our recent acquisition  the accel proton therapy and research instruments business and the operations of the ginzton technology center  or gtc see note segment information of the notes to the consolidated financial statements within this annual report on form k 

table of contents sip designs  manufactures  sells and services linatron x ray accelerators for security and inspection purposes  such as cargo screening  border protection and nondestructive examination for a variety of applications 
the sip business had exceptional growth in net orders and revenues in fiscal year over the prior year 
we are beginning to see wider deployment of our linatron x ray accelerators for cargo screening as customers are starting to place orders for multiple units 
orders from both the north american and international regions contributed to this growth 
while we are optimistic about the long term potential of our sip business and encouraged by the increased interest in our sip products  use of this technology in security cargo screening and border protection is still in its early stages 
orders and revenues for our sip products may be unpredictable as governmental agencies may place larger orders with our oem customers in a short time period and then may not place any orders for a long time period thereafter 
in january  we acquired accel  a privately held supplier of scientific research instruments and proton therapy systems for cancer treatment  the performance for which we report under the other category 
in september  we completed the purchase price allocation of accel related to a contingency that was associated with an unresolved lawsuit  existing at the time of the acquisition 
as part of the settlement of this lawsuit  we agreed to perform under a contract for a fixed price 
from january to september  we were gathering information related to the expected cost of satisfying this contract commitment and completed its assessment as of september  as a result  we recorded an additional loss related to this contingency of million  or approximately million  in accrued liabilities and a reduction to net deferred tax liabilities of million  with a corresponding net increase in goodwill of approximately million 
the final purchase price allocation of accel includes a total contingent loss accrual of million  or approximately million 
if the actual costs related to the contingency exceed the estimated amount or if the estimated loss increases subsequent to september   the variances will be recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings in the periods these variances arise 
in order to realize the full potential of the accel business  we expect to invest substantial resources to properly commercialize accel s advanced proton technology and to build a new medical business 
therefore  we expect accel will continue to be dilutive to our net earnings per diluted share in fiscal year additionally  orders and revenues for our proton therapy products  as well as for our accel research instruments business  may be affected by a number of factors 
proton therapy facilities are relatively large scale construction projects and require significant capital investment and may involve complex project financing 
the customer decision cycle for a proton therapy project is very long and orders for proton therapy systems generally include many contingencies  which need to be resolved before we book an order 
therefore  we do not expect to book any orders for proton therapy systems in the short term 
the accel research instruments business is driven by a few large projects in the billion dollar range and an increasing number of national accelerator projects ranging from one to five hundred million dollars 
as the research projects in this market are all publicly funded  decisions on new projects or project upgrades are subject to public and political factors 
while it appears that there is relatively steady growth in the number and volume of these research projects worldwide  the timing of these research projects may vary significantly 
therefore  accel engineering and manufacturing resources will fluctuate over time as they adapt to the resource requirements of these research projects 
consequently  orders and revenues for accel may be unpredictable and fluctuate 
gtc  our research facility for new and potential markets  continues to develop technologies that enhance our current businesses or that may lead to new business areas  including next generation digital x ray imaging technology  volumetric and functional imaging  improved x ray sources and technology for security and cargo screening applications 
in addition  gtc is developing technologies and products that are designed to improve disease management by more precise targeting of radiation  as well as by employing targeted energy and molecular agents to enhance the effectiveness and broaden the application of radiation therapy 

table of contents this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  as well as the information contained under risk factors in item a 
we discuss our results of operations below 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america  or gaap  requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
we periodically review our accounting policies and estimates and make adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate 
in addition to the accounting policies that are more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  we consider the critical accounting policies described below to be affected by critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting policies that are affected by accounting estimates include share based compensation expense  revenue recognition  valuation of allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventories  assessment of recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  valuation of warranty obligations  assessment of environmental remediation liabilities  valuation of defined benefit and post retirement benefit plans and valuation of taxes on earnings 
such accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  and actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
for a discussion of how these estimates and other factors may affect our business  also see risk factors in item a 
share based compensation expense effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
we have valued our share based payment awards granted beginning in fiscal year using the black scholes option pricing model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model is affected by vms s stock price as well as the input of other subjective assumptions  including the expected term of stock awards and the expected price volatility of vms stock over the expected term of the awards 
the expected term is based on the observed and expected time to post vesting exercise and post vesting cancellations of stock options by our employees 
upon the adoption of sfas r  we determined the expected term of stock options based on the demographic grouping of employees and retirement eligibility 
upon adoption of sfas r  we used a combination of historical and implied volatility  or blended volatility  in deriving the expected volatility assumption 
the blended volatility represents the weighted average of implied volatility and historical volatility 
implied volatility was derived based on six month traded options on vms common stock 
implied volatility is weighted in the calculation of blended volatility based on the ratio of the six month term of the exchange traded options to the expected lives of the employee stock options 
historical volatility represents the remainder of the weighting 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is reflective of market conditions and is generally reflective of both historical volatility and expectations of how future volatility will differ from historical volatility 
in determining the extent of use of implied volatility  we considered i the volume of market activity of traded options  ii the ability to reasonably match the input variables of traded options to those of stock options granted by us  including the date of grant  iii the similarity of the exercise prices  and iv the length of term of traded options 
after considering the above factors  we determined that we cannot rely exclusively on implied volatility based on that fact that the term our six month exchange traded options is less than one year and that it is different from the expected lives of 
table of contents the stock options granted by us 
therefore  we believe a combination of the historical volatility over the expected lives of the stock options granted by us and the implied volatility of six month exchange traded options best reflects the expected volatility of our stock going forward 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
revenue recognition we frequently enter into sales arrangements with customers that contain multiple elements or deliverables such as hardware  software and services 
judgments as to the allocation of the proceeds received from an arrangement to the multiple elements of the arrangement  the determination of whether any undelivered elements are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements and the appropriate timing of revenue recognition are critical in respect to these arrangements to ensure compliance with gaap 
in addition  the amount of product revenues recognized is affected by our judgments as to whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for hardware products and vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value for software products in arrangements with multiple elements 
changes to the elements in an arrangement and the ability to establish objective and reliable evidence of fair value or vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value for those elements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue recognition also depends on the timing of shipment and is subject to customer acceptance and the readiness of customers facilities 
if shipments are not made on scheduled timelines or if the products are not accepted by the customer in a timely manner  our reported revenues may differ materially from expectations 
in addition  revenues related to contracts for certain proton therapy and scientific research instruments products and services  as well as certain sip products offered by the bir business  are recognized under the percentage of completion method 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  sales and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract 
if a loss is expected on a contract  the estimated loss would be charged to cost of sales in the period the loss is identified 
because the percentage of completion method involves considerable use of estimates in determining revenues  costs and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods  and because the estimates must be periodically reviewed and appropriately adjusted  if our estimates prove to be inaccurate or a contract is later terminated  we may be forced to adjust revenues or even record a contract loss in later periods 
allowance for doubtful accounts credit evaluations are undertaken for all major sale transactions before shipment is authorized 
normal payment terms usually require payment of a small portion of the total amount due upon signing of the purchase order  a significant amount upon transfer of risk of loss and the remaining amount upon completion of the installation 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate aged items in the accounts receivable aging report and provide an allowance in an amount we deem adequate for doubtful accounts 
if our evaluation of our customers financial conditions does not reflect the future ability to collect outstanding receivables  additional provisions may be needed and our operating results could be negatively impacted 
inventories our inventories include high technology parts and components that are specialized in nature or subject to rapid technological obsolescence 
we have programs to minimize the required inventories on hand 
table of contents and we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and adjust for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on historical usage rates and our estimates of product demand and production 
actual demand may differ from our estimates  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for obsolete and excess inventory  which would have an impact on our operating results 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is initially recorded when the purchase price paid for a business acquisition exceeds the estimated fair value of the net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired 
the majority of companies that we have acquired have not had significant identified tangible assets and  as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price has been typically allocated to intangible assets and goodwill 
our future operating performance will be impacted by the future amortization of these acquired intangible assets and potential impairment charges related to goodwill if indicators of impairment exist 
as a result of business acquisitions  the allocation of the purchase price to goodwill and intangible assets could have a significant impact on our future operating results 
the allocation of the purchase price of the acquired companies to goodwill and intangible assets requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired assets and the appropriate discount rate for these cash flows 
should conditions be different from management s estimates at the time of the acquisition  material write downs of intangible assets and or goodwill may be required  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we evaluate goodwill and purchased assets with indefinite lives for impairment annually in accordance with sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment test for goodwill is a two step process 
step one consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including the goodwill allocated to each reporting unit 
we determine the fair value of our reporting units based on the present value of estimated future cash flows of the reporting units 
if the carrying amount is in excess of the fair value  step two requires the comparison of the implied fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is recorded as an impairment loss 
the impairment test for intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  if any  consists of a comparison of fair value to carrying value  with any excess of carrying value over fair value being recorded as an impairment loss 
we will continue to make assessments of impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of our fiscal years or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment arise 
we performed such evaluations for the two reporting units that carried goodwill in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  oncology systems and x ray products  and found no impairment 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we performed goodwill impairment testing for the four reporting units that carried goodwill  oncology systems  x ray products  accel and sip  and found no impairment 
warranty obligations we warrant most of our products for a specific period of time  usually one year  against material defects 
we provide for the estimated future costs of warranty obligations in cost of revenues when the related revenues are recognized 
the accrued warranty costs represent our best estimate at the time of sale of the total costs that we will incur to repair or replace product parts that fail while still under warranty 
the amount of accrued estimated warranty costs obligation for established products is primarily based on historical experience as to product failures adjusted for current information on repair costs 
for new products  estimates will include historical experience of similar products  as well as reasonable allowance for start up expenses 
actual warranty costs could differ from the estimated amounts 
on a quarterly basis  we review the accrued balances of our warranty obligations and update the historical warranty cost trends 
if we were required to accrue additional warranty cost in the future  it would negatively impact our operating results 

table of contents environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
environmental remediation liabilities are recorded when environmental assessments and or remediation efforts are probable and the costs of these assessments or remediation efforts can be reasonably estimated  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies  and the american institute of certified public accountants  statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities 
the accrued environmental costs represent our best estimate as to the total costs of remediation and the time period over which these costs will be incurred 
on a quarterly basis  we review these accrued balances 
if we were required to accrue additional environmental remediation costs in the future  it would negatively impact our operating results 
defined benefit and post retirement benefit plans we sponsor six defined benefit pension plans in germany  japan  switzerland and the united kingdom covering the employees who meet the applicable eligibility requirements 
in july  we made changes to the defined benefit plan in the united kingdom by which we terminated the accrual of additional benefits for existing participants and suspended the enrollment of new participants 
we also sponsor a post retirement benefit plan that provides healthcare benefits to certain eligible retirees in the united states 
we do not have any defined benefit pension plan in the united states 
several statistical and other factors that attempt to anticipate future events are used in calculating the expense and liability related to those plans for which the benefit is actuarially determined 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases and healthcare cost increases  which we determine within certain guidelines 
in addition  we also use subjective factors  such as withdrawal and mortality rates  to calculate the expense and liability 
the actuarial assumptions we use are long term assumptions and may differ materially from actual experience particularly in the short term due to changing market and economic conditions and changing participant demographics 
these differences may have a significant impact on the amount of pension expense we recorded 
the expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rates used for defined benefit plans in all countries are based on high quality aa rated corporate bonds with durations corresponding to the expected durations of the benefit obligations 
in countries where the corporate bond market is not sufficiently representative at longer durations  the discount rate also takes into account the yield of long term government bonds corresponding to the duration of the benefit obligations and the difference between the yield curve on high quality corporate fixed income investments and government fixed income investment 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations 
taxes on earnings we are subject to taxes on earnings in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
as a global taxpayer  significant judgments and estimates are required in evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for taxes on earnings 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves addressing uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations 
we maintain reserves for potential tax contingencies arising in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
such reserves are based on our assessment of the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome and the potential loss from such contingencies  and may be adjusted from time to time in light of changing facts and circumstances 
these reserves are maintained until such time as the matter is settled or the statutory period for adjustment has passed 
adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that our reserves for tax contingencies are inadequate 
the provision for taxes on earnings includes the effect of changes to these reserves that are considered appropriate 

table of contents in addition  the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient future taxable earnings in certain tax jurisdictions to utilize these deferred tax assets 
should we conclude it is more likely than not that we will be unable to recover our net deferred tax assets in these tax jurisdictions  we would increase our valuation allowance and our tax provision would increase in the period in which we make such a determination 
earnings derived from our international regions are generally taxed at rates lower than us rates 
our effective tax rate is impacted by existing tax laws in both the united states and in the respective countries in which our international subsidiaries do business 
in addition  a decrease in the percentage of our total earnings from our international regions  or a change in the mix of international regions among particular tax jurisdictions  could increase our effective tax rate 
also  our current effective tax rate does not assume us taxes on undistributed profits of certain foreign subsidiaries 
these earnings could become subject to incremental foreign withholding or us federal and state taxes should they either be deemed or actually remitted to the united states 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
the provisions are effective beginning in the first quarter of fiscal year see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements within this annual report on form k for further discussion

table of contents total revenues increased in fiscal years and over the respective prior years primarily due to increases in oncology systems revenues in each year  as well as contributions from the x ray products business segment and the other category  which in fiscal year included the acquired businesses of accel and bir 
the increase in total revenues in fiscal years and over the respective prior year periods was primarily due to the growth in product revenues  and to a lesser extent  an increase in service contracts and other revenues 
oncology systems and the x ray products business segments  as well as our businesses in the other category  contributed to the growth in product revenues in fiscal years and over the year ago periods 
product revenues grew less in fiscal year than in fiscal year over their respective prior year periods primarily due to slower product revenue growth in oncology systems 
in fiscal years and  oncology systems and our businesses in the other category contributed to the increase in service contracts and other revenues over the prior years 
in fiscal year  service contracts and other revenues grew at a higher rate than product revenues primarily due to the increase in oncology systems service contract revenues  as well as the contribution from accel 
the growth in oncology systems service contracts revenues  aided by the inclusion of accel contract revenues  caused our service contracts and other revenues to represent a higher percentage of total revenues 
in fiscal year  the growth in oncology systems service contracts revenues was the primary contributor to the increase in total service contracts and other revenues over fiscal year international revenue growth exceeded the north american revenue growth in fiscal years and over the respective prior years and  in fiscal year  for the first time international revenues represented more than half of our worldwide revenues

this excludes revenues from spare parts sold by our service department 
increases in both product and service contracts revenues contributed to the growth in oncology systems revenues in fiscal year over fiscal year the increase in oncology systems product revenues was driven by higher sales volume of accessory products that enable igrt and our trilogy linear accelerator  partially offset by lower sales volume of our high energy linear accelerators and other non igrt products such as imrt upgrades  simulators and brachytherapy products 
oncology systems product revenues  however  grew at a slower rate in fiscal year over fiscal year than growth in fiscal year over fiscal year due primarily to weak first half net orders in fiscal year we saw greater variability in the length of the customer purchasing cycle  which we believe resulted from a 
table of contents more complex decision making process associated with large dollar value of transactions for more sophisticated igrt and surgical equipment 
because a portion of our orders for products are shipped within one year of the placement of such order from the customer  our fiscal year product revenues were adversely impacted since there were less product orders to ship within the fiscal year 
during fiscal year  oncology systems revenues were also negatively impacted by the timing of product shipments in accordance with planned customer requested delivery dates 
the increase in service contracts revenues in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily driven by the increase in sophistication of our products and the growing installed base of software products that generate increased annual maintenance contracts and renewals 
oncology systems revenues in fiscal year increased from fiscal year  primarily due to an increase in product revenues attributable to higher sales volume of accessory products that enable imrt and igrt including our obi and our trilogy linear accelerators  and to a lesser extent  higher sales volume of our software and brachytherapy products

all of our geographic regions contributed to the increase in oncology systems revenues for fiscal year over fiscal year oncology systems continued to benefit from strong cyclical demand in the international regions that started a few years ago driven by the adoption of imrt and the underserved medical needs outside of the united states after several years of very slow international revenue growth 
in fiscal year  our north american revenues increased over the prior year due to growth in demand for our new products for igrt

compared to fiscal year  service gross margin increased from to for fiscal year the improvement in service contracts gross margin was due primarily to higher volume and the continued growth in higher margin software maintenance contracts in oncology systems 
the percentage points decrease in oncology systems product gross margin in fiscal year over the prior year was primarily due to the effect of hedging foreign currency denominated sales contracts when the orders were booked 
while the weakening of the us dollar positively affected our revenues in fiscal year  it had a negative impact on our oncology systems gross margin percentage 
oncology systems gross margin decreased in fiscal year compared to the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in product gross margin which was primarily attributable to i higher ramp up costs and higher proportion of revenue associated with our new products for igrt  ii share based compensation expense recorded in fiscal year in the oncology systems segment in connection with our adoption of sfas r  and iii a continuing mix shift towards a higher proportion of international revenues which typically have lower gross margins than revenues from north america 
the decrease in product gross margin was partially offset by an improvement in service contracts gross margin  primarily due to higher volumes and growth in higher margin software maintenance contracts in oncology systems 
x ray products gross margin in fiscal year increased by percentage points from the prior year 
the gain in gross margin resulted from i product mix shift towards sales of higher margin high power  anode grounded ct scanning tubes and flat panel detectors  ii cost reduction efforts and iii leverage from higher sales volume 
x ray products gross margin in fiscal year increased slightly from fiscal 
table of contents year due to increased sales of our higher gross margin flat panel detectors was significantly offset by product mix shift toward lower gross margin x ray tube products and increased share based compensation expense in the x ray products segment 
x ray products gross margin will continue to be impacted by factors including sales mix between flat panel detectors and x ray tube products  product pricing  timing of new product introduction  cost reduction initiatives and other factors 
therefore  we may not be able to sustain the high gross margin achieved in fiscal year research and development fiscal years dollars in millions change change research and development as a percentage of total revenues the million increase in research and development expenses in fiscal year was driven by increased spending of million in oncology systems  million in x ray products and million in the other category

these increases were partially offset by i a gain on balance sheet hedging of million  ii a decrease in accounting fees of approximately million primarily due to the unusually high expenses in fiscal year related to compliance with the required documentation and testing of internal control over financial reporting as mandated by the sarbanes oxley act of and iii favorable foreign currency translation impact of million resulting from the relatively strong us dollar for our foreign operations as the selling  general and administrative expenses are translated into us dollars 
interest income  net fiscal years dollars in millions change change interest income  net the decrease in interest income  net in fiscal year over fiscal year was due to lower balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities and increased borrowings in fiscal year the increase in interest income  net in fiscal year compared to fiscal year was attributable to an increase in interest rates in fiscal year taxes on earnings fiscal years change change effective tax rate the increase in the effective tax rates in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to tax benefits recorded in the prior fiscal year related to i the repatriation of foreign earnings under the american jobs creation of  or the job creation act  which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate of approximately four percentage points in fiscal year  ii a deferred tax asset adjustment for certain prior years state and federal temporary differences  which resulted a decrease in our effective tax rate of approximately two percentage points in fiscal year 
table of contents the decrease in the effective tax rates in fiscal year from fiscal year was primarily due to tax benefits related to i the repatriation of foreign earnings under the jobs creation act  which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate of approximately four percentage points  ii a deferred tax asset adjustment for certain prior years state and federal temporary differences  which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate of approximately two percentage points  iii the reduction of reserves for potential tax contingencies as a result of the lapse of the statute of limitations in certain domestic jurisdictions  which resulted in a one percentage point decrease in our effective tax rate and a shift in the geographic mix of earnings towards countries with lower tax rates  which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate of approximately three percentage points in fiscal year over fiscal year during fiscal year  we repatriated approximately million in foreign earnings pursuant to the jobs creation act and recorded a million net tax benefit 
we also recorded a net tax benefit of million in fiscal year related to adjustments of certain prior years state and federal temporary differences 
in general  our effective income tax rate differs from the us federal statutory rate largely as a result of foreign income taxed at rates lower than the us federal rate  and state income taxes 
our future effective tax rate could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates  by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities  or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
net earnings per diluted share fiscal years change change net earnings per diluted share the increase in net earnings per diluted share in fiscal year over fiscal year can be attributed to the increase in total revenues and the reduction in outstanding shares of common stock due to stock repurchases  partially offset by the increase in effective tax rate and the decline in gross margin and profitability due to our planned investments in growth initiatives  including our proton therapy acquisition  research and development  and our expansion into china

table of contents net orders total net orders by segment and region fiscal years dollars in millions change change oncology systems north america total international total oncology systems x ray products north america total international total x ray products other total net orders our total net orders grew by in fiscal year from fiscal year  including acquired backlog from bir and accel of million 
all of our businesses contributed to the net order growth in fiscal year the increase in our total net orders for fiscal year over fiscal year was primarily due to the increase in oncology systems net orders 
oncology systems experienced a weak net order growth in the first half of fiscal year  that impacted both the north american and the international regions and was caused by greater variability in the length of the customer purchasing cycle  which we believe resulted from a more complex decision process tied in part to the large dollar value of the transactions for more sophisticated igrt and surgical equipment 
oncology systems net orders recovered in the second half of the fiscal year and for the total year grew  compared to a growth from fiscal year over north american oncology systems net orders grew in fiscal year from fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year from fiscal year the growth in north american net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year reflect continued growth in demand for our products that enable igrt including our obi  our trilogy linear accelerators and service contracts  partially offset by declines in demand for non igrt products including imrt upgrades and brachytherapy products 
the growth in north american net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year reflected increased demand for our accessory products that enable igrt including our obi and for the trilogy linear accelerators 
we believe oncology systems experienced strong growth in north america in fiscal year as this region adopted igrt technology 
international net orders for oncology systems grew in fiscal year over the prior year compared to in fiscal year over fiscal year all geographic regions contributed to the increase in international net orders in fiscal year the growth in international net orders also reflects increased demand for our products that enable igrt including our obi  our trilogy linear accelerators and service contracts  partially offset by decrease in demand for other product lines  including imrt upgrades and brachytherapy products 
after several years of strong growth driven by the rapid adoption of imrt technology  the international region experienced a slowdown in demand for radiotherapy capital equipment for imrt and net orders increased modestly by in fiscal year  compared to  and in fiscal years  and over the respective earlier year periods 
consistent with what we saw in north america  we expect net orders to be lower following a rapid imrt adoption cycle and that imrt is now an established treatment methodology in the international regions 
we expect that igrt will continue to emerge as one of the main contributors to net orders and revenue in our oncology systems business segment  with north america ahead of international regions in the timing of adoption 

table of contents by comparison  the trailing twelve months oncology systems net order growth rate as of june  was  including a increase for north america and a increase for international regions 
the trailing twelve month oncology systems net orders growth rate as of march  was  including a increase for north america and a increase for international regions 
consistent with the historical pattern  we expect that oncology systems net orders will continue to experience regional fluctuations 
x ray products have relatively short turn around from net orders to shipments 
the increase in x ray products net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year was due to increased demand for our high power  anode grounded ct scanning tubes and  to a lesser extent  increased demand for our flat panel detectors 
the flat panel detector product line has become a significant contributor to our x ray products business segment 
we believe the flat panel detector product line will continue to contribute to our growth in net orders as flat panel detectors  which enable filmless x ray imaging  replace traditional film and image intensifier x ray products in many medical applications 
the high growth in net orders in fiscal year over fiscal year in the other category  which is comprised of sip including bir  accel and gtc  benefited from acquired backlog of million from the acquisitions of accel and bir 
excluding the impact of acquired backlog  the growth in net orders in the other category in fiscal year of was driven by i the strong growth in net orders for our sip linatron x ray accelerators for cargo screening and border protection and for replacements of older products for industrial inspection and non destructive testing and ii new net orders received for proton therapy services and scientific research instruments from accel 
we are beginning to see wider deployment of our linatron x ray accelerators for cargo screening as customers are starting to place orders for multiple units of our linatron x ray accelerators 
for fiscal year over fiscal year  net orders in the other category increased by primarily due to a substantial increase in orders from oem customers for our linatron x ray accelerators for cargo screening and border protection 
while we are optimistic about the long term potential of our sip business and encouraged by the increased interest in our products  use of this technology in security cargo screening and border protection is in its early stages and governmental agencies have provided limited public information about plans for adopting such technologies 
orders for our sip products may be unpredictable as governmental agencies may place larger orders with our oem customers in a short time period and then may not place any orders for a long time period thereafter 
also  while we believe there is a promising market for proton therapy systems  the market for proton therapy treatment is still developing  and we expect great variability in the demand for these products due to the large scale of the related construction projects  the complexity of project financing and the resulting longer customer decision cycles when compared with our oncology systems business 
we do not expect to book an order for proton therapy system in the short term 
we also expect that demand for accel research instruments products will vary as they are tied primarily to large  government or national laboratory research projects 
in any given period  orders growth in either north america or international regions  or both  could fluctuate  given the high dollar amount of individual orders particularly in our businesses other than x ray products 
the actual timing of sales and revenue recognition will vary significantly based on the delivery requirements of individual orders  acceptance schedule and the readiness of individual customer sites for installation of our products and are usually shorter for some types of orders  such as upgrades ie  the addition of new features or accessories to existing equipment 
thus  orders in any quarter or period are not necessarily directly correlated to the level of sales or revenues in any particular future quarter or period 
moreover  as the overall mix of net orders includes a greater proportion of software products and newly introduced oncology systems products  which typically have a longer time from order to completion of installation  the average time period within which orders convert into sales could lengthen and our revenue in a specific period could be lower as a result

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the measurement of our ability to meet potential cash requirements  including ongoing commitments to repay borrowings  acquire businesses and fund continuing operations 
our sources of cash include operations  stock option exercises and employee stock purchases  borrowings and interest income 
our cash usage is actively managed on a daily basis to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet our needs 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities the following table summarizes our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in millions september  september  increase decrease cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities cash and cash equivalents marketable securities total the million decrease in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in fiscal year was primarily attributable to cash used in fiscal year for the repurchase of our common stock of million  capital expenditures of million  the acquisition of accel of million  the acquisition of bir of million  investment in dpix holding of million for the construction of a manufacturing facility in colorado  the repayment of bank borrowings of million  the repurchase of the ownership interest in our japanese subsidiary from mitsubishi electric co  or melco  of million  investment of million in corporate owned life insurance contracts and the earn out payment of million in connection with the acquisition of melco s radiotherapy equipment and service business 
these uses were significantly offset by million cash generated from operating activities  million of cash provided by stock option exercises and employee stock purchases  million of cash provided by net borrowings under the credit facility and million of cash provided by the excess tax benefits from share based compensation 
in fiscal year  exchange rate changes reduced cash and cash equivalents by million 
at september   we had approximately million or of total cash and cash equivalents in the united states 
approximately million or of total cash and cash equivalents was held abroad and could be subject to additional taxation if it were repatriated to the united states 
as of september   most of our cash and cash equivalents that were held abroad were in us dollars 
additionally  because our cash levels in the united states are relatively low  we may need to borrow funds in the future to satisfy cash flow needs  such as borrowings through our revolving credit facility

as a result of our adoption of sfas r  we reported million and million of excess tax benefits from share based compensation as cash provided by financing activities in fiscal years and respectively  which was previously reported as cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year the million increase in net cash from operating activities in fiscal year from fiscal year was driven by a net change of million in operating assets and liabilities working capital items and a net increase in non cash items of million and non cash net earnings from discontinued operations in fiscal year of million  partially offset by a decrease in net earnings of million 
the major contributors to the net change in working capital items in fiscal year were inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets  deferred revenues and advance payments from customers 
inventories increased primarily due to higher productions to meet anticipated customer demands for products in all of our businesses 
prepaid expenses and other current assets increased due to overall growth of our business operations 
deferred revenues decreased due to higher amount of revenues recognized based on customer acceptance of our oncology systems products and the recognition of a portion of revenues associated with certain products that enable igrt upon shipment beginning in the second quarter of fiscal year  rather than deferring of the revenues until customer acceptance 
advance payments from customers increased due to increased orders and lower revenue growth in oncology systems 
the million decrease in net cash from operating activities during fiscal year from was driven by a net change of million in operating assets and liabilities working capital items and a net decrease in non cash items of million  partially offset by an increase in net earnings of million 
in fiscal year  the major contributors to the net change in working capital items were accounts receivable  inventories  accrued expenses  deferred revenues and advance payments from customers 
accounts receivables increased due to higher revenues in fiscal year compared to the prior year and the continuing shift to a higher proportion of international deliveries  which typically have a longer collection cycle than north america and a longer period from shipment to revenue recognition 

table of contents inventories increased due to the continuing shift to a higher proportion of international deliveries  which typically have a longer period from shipment to cost recognition  as well as due to anticipated customer demands for both oncology systems and x ray products business segments 
accrued expenses increased primarily due to increase in income taxes payable 
the increase in income taxes payable was the result of lower estimated tax payments made during fiscal year deferred revenues increased due to increasing revenue recognition deferrals related to timing of completion of installation of our oncology systems products and our growing sales of new oncology systems products  as well as the higher proportion of our oncology systems business represented by international revenues with the accompanying longer period from shipment to revenue recognition 
advance payments from customers increased primarily due to increased orders 
we expect that cash provided by operating activities may fluctuate in future periods as a result of a number of factors  including fluctuations in our operating results  timing of product shipments  accounts receivable collections  inventory management  and the timing of tax and other payments

contingencies we are subject to a variety of environmental laws around the world regulating the handling  storage  transport and disposal of hazardous materials that do or may create increased costs for some of our operations 
although we follow procedures that we consider appropriate under existing regulations  these procedures can be costly and we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials  and  in the event of such an incident  we could be held liable for any damages that result 
in addition  we could be assessed fines or penalties for failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
these costs and any future violations or liability under environmental laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  we may be required to incur significant additional costs to comply with future changes in existing environmental laws and regulations or new laws and regulations 
for example  several countries  including many in the european union  or eu  are requiring medical equipment manufacturers to bear some or all of the cost of product disposal at the end of a product s useful life  thus creating increased costs for our operations 
the eu has also adopted a directive that may require the adoption of restrictions on the use of some hazardous substances in certain of our products sold in the eu 
this directive could increase costs for our operations 
from the time we began operating  we handled and disposed of hazardous materials and wastes following procedures that were considered appropriate under regulations  if any  existing at the time 
we also hired companies to dispose of wastes generated by our operations 
the us environmental protection agency  or epa  or third parties have named us as a potentially responsible party  or prp  
table of contents under the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of  as amended  or cercla  at eight sites where we  as varian associates  inc  are alleged to have shipped such wastes for recycling or disposal 
as a prp we may have an obligation to reimburse the epa or other third parties for cleanup costs at these sites 
in addition  we are overseeing environmental cleanup projects and  as applicable  reimbursing third parties for cleanup activities under the direction of  or in consultation with  federal  state and or local agencies at certain current vms or former varian associates  inc facilities including facilities disposed of in connection with our sale of our electron devices business during and the sale of our thin film systems business during 
under the terms of the agreement governing the distribution of the shares  or the spin offs  of varian  inc  or vi  and varian semiconductor equipment associates  inc  or vsea  by us in  vi and vsea are each obligated to indemnify us for one third of these environmental cleanup costs after adjusting for any insurance proceeds realized or tax benefits recognized by us 
as described below  we have accrued a total of million at september  to cover our liabilities for these cleanup projects 
various uncertainties make it difficult to estimate the likelihood or cost of certain third party claims  project management costs and legal costs at all of the sites and facilities 
in addition  for the eight sites and one of the facilities  various uncertainties make it difficult to assess the likelihood and scope of further cleanup activities or to estimate the future costs of such activities 
as of september   we nonetheless estimated that our future exposure net of vi s and vsea s indemnification obligations for the cleanup costs  third party claims  project management costs and legal costs for these nine locations ranged in the aggregate from million to million 
the time frames over which these cleanup project costs are estimated vary  ranging from one year to years as of september  we believe that no amount in the foregoing range of estimated future costs is more probable of being incurred than any other amount in such range and therefore we have accrued million for these cleanup projects as of september  the amount accrued has not been discounted to present value due to the uncertainties that make it difficult to develop a best estimate of future costs 
as to all other facilities  we have gained sufficient knowledge to better estimate the scope and costs of future cleanup activities based upon formal agreements with other parties defining our future liabilities or formal cleanup plans that have either been approved by or completed in accordance with the requirements of the state or federal environmental agency with jurisdiction over the facility 
as of september   we estimated that our future exposure net of vi s and vsea s indemnification obligations for the cleanup costs at these facilities  and reimbursements of third party s claims for these facilities  ranged in the aggregate from million to million 
the time frames over which these cleanup project costs are estimated vary with each facility  ranging from years to years as of september  as to each of these facilities  management determined that a particular amount within the range of estimated costs was a better estimate of the future environmental liability than any other amount within the range  and that the amount and timing of these future costs were reliably determinable 
the best estimate within the range was million at september  we accordingly accrued million  which represents our best estimate of the future costs of million discounted at  net of inflation 

table of contents at september   our reserve for environmental liabilities  based upon future environmental related costs estimated as of that date  was calculated as follows in millions recurring costs non recurring costs total anticipated future costs fiscal years thereafter total costs less imputed interest reserve amount recurring costs include expenses for such tasks as ongoing operation  maintenance and monitoring of cleanup while non recurring costs include expenses for such tasks as soil excavation and treatment  injection monitoring well installation and other costs for soil and groundwater in situ treatment by injection  ground and surface water treatment system construction  soil and groundwater investigation  certain governmental agency costs required to be reimbursed by us  governmental agency response costs including agency costs required to be reimbursed by the responding company  treatment system and monitoring well removal and closure  and costs to defend against and settle pending and anticipated third party claims 
when we developed the estimates above  we considered the financial strength of other potentially responsible parties 
these amounts are  however  only estimates and may be revised in the future as we get more information on these projects 
we may also spend more or less than these estimates 
based on current information  we believe that our reserves are adequate  but as the scope of our obligations becomes more clearly defined  these reserves and the associated indemnification obligations of vi and vsea may be modified and related charges credits against earnings may be made 
we receive certain cash payments in the form of settlements and judgments from defendants  our insurers and other third parties from time to time 
we have also reached an agreement with an insurance company under which the insurance company has agreed to pay a portion of our past and future environmental related expenditures  and we  therefore  had included a million receivable in other assets at september  we believe that this receivable is recoverable because it is based on a binding  written settlement agreement with a solvent and financially viable insurance company and the insurance company has paid the claims that we have made in the past 
our present and past facilities have been in operation for many years  and over that time in the course of those operations  these facilities have used substances  that are or might be considered hazardous  and we have generated and disposed of wastes  that are or might be considered hazardous 
therefore  it is possible that additional environmental issues may arise in the future that we cannot now predict 
we are also involved  from time to time  in other legal proceedings  claims and government inspections or investigations  arising in the ordinary course of our business 
such matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable with assurance 
we accrue amounts that we believe are adequate to address any liabilities related to legal proceedings and other loss contingencies that we believe will result in a probable loss 
while there can be no assurances as to the ultimate outcome of any legal proceeding or other loss contingency involving us  management does not believe any pending matter will be resolved in a manner that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  it is possible that a legal or other proceeding brought against us could have an impact of this nature 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements in conjunction with the sale of our products in the ordinary course of business  we provide standard indemnification of business partners and customers for losses suffered or incurred for property damages  death and injury and for patent  copyright or any other intellectual property infringement claims by any third parties with respect to our products 
the term of these indemnification arrangements is generally perpetual 
except for losses related to property damages  the maximum potential amount of future payments we could be required to make under these agreements is unlimited 
as of september   we have not incurred any significant costs since the spin offs to defend lawsuits or settle claims related to these indemnification arrangements 
we have entered into indemnification agreements with our directors and officers that may require us to indemnify our directors and officers against liabilities that may arise by reason of their status or service as directors or officers  and to advance their expenses incurred as a result of any legal proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified 
generally  the maximum obligation under such indemnifications is not explicitly stated and  as a result  the overall amount of these obligations cannot be reasonably estimated

based on a preliminary analysis  we expect that a cumulative effect adjustment of less than million will be charged to retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year to increase the reserve for uncertain tax positions 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the potential impact that sfas may have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employer s accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  or sfas sfas requires us to a recognize a plan s funded status in the statement of financial position  b measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year and c recognize changes in the funded status of a defined benefit plan in the year in which the changes occur through other comprehensive income 
we adopted the requirement to recognize the funded status of a defined benefit plan and the disclosure requirements in the fourth quarter of fiscal year see note retirement plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements within this annual report on form k for a discussion of the effects of adopting the recognition provisions and disclosure requirements of sfas we are not required to adopt the measurement provisions until fiscal year we are assessing the potential impact that the recognition provision of sfas may have on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
based on the evaluation to date  we do not believe the adoption of the measurement date provisions of sfas will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to two primary types of market risks foreign currency exchange rate risk and interest rate risk 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as a global entity  we are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve 
adverse movements could have a material negative impact on our financial results 
our primary exposures related to foreign currency denominated sales and purchases are in europe  asia  australia and canada 
we have many transactions denominated in foreign currencies and address certain of those financial exposures through a program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we sell products throughout the world  often in the currency of the customer s country  and typically hedge certain of these larger firmly committed foreign currency denominated sales orders when they are not in the subsidiaries functional currency 
these foreign currency sales orders that fit our risk management policy criteria  excluding the amounts relating to the products made outside of the united states  are hedged with forward exchange contracts 
we may use other derivative instruments in the future 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into forward exchange contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the forward exchange contracts range from one to twelve months in maturity 
as of september   we did not have any forward exchange contracts with an original maturity greater than twelve months 
as international deliveries may extend beyond twelve months  we may hedge beyond twelve months in the future 
we also hedge the balance sheet exposures from our various foreign subsidiaries and business units 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to minimize the short term impact of currency fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar functional currency 
the notional amounts of forward exchange contracts are not a measure of our exposure 
the fair value of forward exchange contracts generally reflects the estimated amounts that we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts at the reporting date  thereby taking into account and approximating the current unrealized and realized gains or losses of the open contracts 
a move in foreign currency exchange rates would change the fair value of the contracts  and the fair value of the underlying exposures hedged by the contracts would change in a similar offsetting manner 

table of contents the notional values of sold and purchased forward exchange contracts for both hedges of foreign currency denominated sales orders and balance sheet exposures from our subsidiaries outstanding at september  were as follows in millions notional value sold notional value purchased unrealized gain loss fair value australian dollar british pound canadian dollar danish krone euro japanese yen new zealand dollar singapore dollar swedish krona swiss franc totals interest rate risk our market risk exposure to changes in interest rates depends primarily on our investment portfolio and short term borrowings 
our investment portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents as of september  we did not have any marketable securities at september  the principal amount of cash and cash equivalents at september  totaled million with a weighted average interest rate of 
in the event that interest rates were to decrease substantially  we might reinvest a substantial portion of our investment portfolio at lower interest rates 
we have established a million unsecured revolving credit facility with bank of america  na  or bofa  to support general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and stock repurchases 
borrowings under the credit facility accrue interest either i based on the libor plus a margin of 
to 
based on a leverage ratio involving funded indebtedness and earnings before interest  tax and depreciation and amortization  or ebitda or ii based upon a base rate of either the federal funds rate plus 
or bofa s announced prime rate  which ever is greater  plus a margin of to based on a leverage ratio involving funded indebtedness and ebitda  depending upon our instructions to bofa as to whether advances are to be based on the libor rate or the base rate 
we may select borrowing periods of one  two  three or six months for advances based on the libor rate 
interest rates on advances based on the base rate are adjustable daily 
we are affected by market risk exposure primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on amounts payable under this credit facility 
as of september   an aggregate principal amount of million was outstanding under the credit facility with interest being accrued based on a margin plus libor 
if the principal amounts outstanding under this credit facility remained at this year end level for an entire year and libor increased or decreased  respectively  by  our interest expense would increase or decrease  respectively  an additional million 
to date  we have not used derivative financial instruments to hedge the interest rate of our investment portfolio  short term borrowings or long term debt  but may consider the use of derivative instruments in the future 
in addition  we had million of long term debt outstanding at september  carried at a weighted average fixed interest rate of with principal payments due in various installments over a seven year period 

table of contents the table below presents principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by year for our cash and cash equivalents  long term debt and short term borrowings 
fiscal years dollars in millions thereafter total assets cash and cash equivalents average interest rate marketable securities average interest rate liabilities long term debt average interest rate short term borrowings under the credit facility average interest rate the estimated fair value of our cash and cash equivalents of which was held abroad at september  and could be subject to additional taxation if it was repatriated to the united states and the estimated fair value of our short term borrowings under the credit facility approximated the principal amounts reflected above based on the maturities of these financial instruments 
the fair value of our long term debt is estimated based on the current rates available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities 
under this method  the fair value of our debt was estimated to be million at september  we determined the estimated fair value amount by using available market information and commonly accepted valuation methodologies 
however  it requires considerable judgment in interpreting market data to develop estimates of fair value 
accordingly  the fair value estimate presented is not necessarily indicative of the amount that we or holders of the instrument could realize in a current market exchange 
the use of different assumptions and or estimation methodologies may have a material effect on the estimated fair value 
although payments under certain of our operating leases for our facilities are tied to market indices  these operating leases do not expose us to material interest rate risk
