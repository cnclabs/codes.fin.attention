item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto  as well as the business and risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
overview we are a leading provider of specialty contracting services 
these services are provided throughout the united states and include engineering  construction  maintenance and installation services to telecommunications providers  underground locating services to various utilities including telecommunications providers  and other construction and maintenance services to electric utilities and others 
additionally  we provide services on a limited basis in canada 
for the fiscal year ended july   specialty contracting services related to the telecommunications industry  underground utility locating  and electric and other construction and maintenance services to electric utilities and others contributed approximately   and  respectively  to our total revenues from continuing operations 
we conduct operations through our subsidiaries 
our revenues may fluctuate as a result of changes in the capital expenditure and maintenance budgets of our customers  and changes in the general level of construction activity 
the capital expenditures and maintenance budgets of our telecommunications customers may be impacted by consumer demands on telecommunication providers  the introduction of new communication technologies  the physical maintenance needs of their infrastructure  the actions of the federal communications commission  and general economic conditions 
a significant portion of our services are covered by multi year master service agreements and other arrangements with customers that have historically extended over multiple year periods 
we are currently a party to approximately of these arrangements 
master service agreements generally are for contract periods of one or more years and contain customer specified service requirements  such as discrete unit pricing for individual tasks 
to the extent that such contracts specify exclusivity  there are often a number of exceptions  including the ability by the customer to issue work orders to others valued above a specified dollar limit  the self performance of the work by the customer s in house workforce  and the ability to use others when jointly placing facilities with another utility 
in most cases  a customer may terminate these agreements for convenience with written notice 
the remainder of our services is provided pursuant to contracts for specific projects 
long term contracts relate to specific projects with terms in excess of one year from the contract date 
short term contracts for specific projects are generally three to four months in duration 
a portion of our contracts include retainage provisions under which to of the contract invoicing is withheld by the customer subject to project completion 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
the following table summarizes our revenues from long term contracts  including multi year master service agreements  as a percentage of total revenue from continuing operations fiscal year ended july  july  july  multi year master service agreements other long term contracts total long term contracts 
table of contents the percentage increase in revenue derived from multi year master service agreements in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to agreements in place at cable express holding company cable express and prince telecom holdings  inc prince which were acquired in september and december  respectively 
additionally  hurricane restoration service revenue was recognized during fiscal pursuant to short term contracts 
there was no hurricane restoration service revenue recognized during fiscal a significant portion of our revenue comes from several large customers 
the following table reflects the percentage of total revenue from customers contributing at least of our total revenue from continuing operations in fiscal   or fiscal year ended july  july  july  at t verizon comcast time warner embarq charter qwest questar gas windstream for comparison purposes  bellsouth and at t revenues have been combined for periods prior to their december merger 
cost of earned revenues includes all direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including costs for construction personnel  subcontractors  operation of capital equipment excluding depreciation  and insurance 
for a majority of our contracts  our customers provide all necessary materials and we provide the personnel  tools  and equipment necessary to perform installation and maintenance services 
materials supplied by our customers  for which the customer retains the financial and performance risk  are not included in our revenue or costs of sales 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our utility locating services 
a change in claims experience or actuarial assumptions related to these risks could materially affect our results of operations 
general and administrative costs include all of our costs at the corporate level  as well as costs of our subsidiaries management personnel and administrative overhead 
these costs primarily consist of employee compensation and related expenses  including stock based compensation  professional fees  provision or recoveries of bad debt expense  and other costs that are not directly related to the provision of services under customer contracts 
our senior management  including senior managers of our subsidiaries  performs substantially all sales and marketing functions as part of their management responsibilities and  accordingly  we have not incurred material sales and marketing expenses 
acquisitions as part of our growth strategy  we may acquire companies that expand  complement  or diversify our business 
we regularly review opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions 
our ability to sustain our growth and maintain our competitive position may be affected by our ability to identify acquisition opportunities and successfully integrate any businesses acquired 
in september  we acquired the outstanding common stock of cable express for a purchase price of approximately million  including transaction fees  and assumed million in capital lease obligations 
during december  we acquired the outstanding common stock of prince for a purchase price of approximately million  including transaction fees 
cable express and prince provide specialty contracting services for 
table of contents leading cable multiple system operators 
these services include the installation and maintenance of customer premise equipment  including set top boxes and cable modems 
during september  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of rje telecom  inc rje for a cash purchase price of approximately million 
rje provides specialty contracting services primarily to telephone companies 
in march  we acquired certain assets and assumed certain liabilities  including million in capital lease obligations  of cavo communications  inc cavo for million 
cavo provides specialty contracting services for leading cable multiple system operators 
these services include the installation and maintenance of customer premise equipment  including set top boxes and cable modems 
in january  we acquired certain assets of a cable television operator for approximately million 
neither of these two acquisitions was material to our revenue  results of operations or financial position 
discontinued operations during fiscal  apex digital  llc apex  a wholly owned subsidiary  notified its primary customer of its intention to cease performing installation services in accordance with its contractual rights 
effective december  this customer  a satellite broadcast provider  transitioned its installation service requirements to others and apex ceased providing these services 
as a result  we have discontinued the operations of apex and presented its results separately in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
we do not expect the cessation of these installation services to have any material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
outlook the telecommunications industry has undergone and continues to undergo significant changes due to governmental deregulation  advances in technology  increased competition as the telephone and cable industries converge  and growing consumer demand for enhanced and bundled services 
as a result of these factors  the networks of our customers increasingly face demands for more capacity and greater reliability which in turn  increases the needs of customers for the services we provide 
telecommunications network operators are increasingly relying on the deployment of fiber optic cable technology deeper into their networks and closer to consumers in order to respond to demands for capacity  reliability  and product bundles of voice  video  and high speed data services 
fiber deployments have enabled an increasing number of cable companies to begin to offer voice services in addition to their traditional video and data services 
these voice services from cable operators periodically require the upgrade of in home wiring and require the installation of customer premise equipment 
fiber deployments are also beginning to facilitate the provisioning of video services by local telephone companies in addition to their traditional voice and high speed data services 
during and  several large telephone companies announced fiber to the premise and fiber to the node initiatives as a means to begin to actively compete with cable operators 
these initiatives continued through fiscal and resulting in demand for our services 
we believe the latest developments and trends in the telecommunications industry support our outlook for growth 
consistent with historical practice  telecommunications providers have continued to outsource a significant portion of their engineering  construction and maintenance requirements in order to reduce their investment in capital equipment  provide flexibility in workforce sizing  expand product offerings without large increases in incremental hiring and focus on those competencies they consider core to their business success 
we also provide underground utility locating services to a variety of utility companies including telecommunication providers 
underground excavation is involved in a substantial portion of overall economic activity  including the construction and maintenance of telephone  cable television  power and gas utility networks  the construction and maintenance of roads and highways as well as the construction of new and existing commercial and residential projects 
utility line locating is required prior to underground excavation 
the trend for outsourcing this requirement  along with the pace of overall economic activity  primarily influences the demand for our utility line locating services 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to revenue recognition for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings  allowance for doubtful accounts  accrued self insured claims  valuation of goodwill and intangible assets  asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization  including amortization of intangible assets  and accounting for performance based stock awards  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
application of these estimates and assumptions requires the exercise of judgment as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the accounting for our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations because they involve making significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the impact of these policies affect our reported and expected financial results and are discussed in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations below 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed the disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies described herein  and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units of delivery or cost to cost measures 
a significant majority of our contracts are based on units of delivery and revenue is recognized as each unit is completed 
revenues from contracts using the cost to cost measures of completion are recognized based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs 
revenues from services provided under time and materials based contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
contract costs include all direct costs of providing services under our contracts  including costs for construction personnel  subcontractors  operation of capital equipment excluding depreciation  and insurance 
for a majority of our contracts  our customers provide all necessary materials and we provide the personnel  tools  and equipment necessary to perform installation and maintenance services 
materials supplied by our customers for which the customer retains the financial and performance risk associated with those materials are not included in our revenue or costs of sales 
the current asset costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represents revenues recognized in excess of amounts billed 
the current liability billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represents billings in excess of revenues recognized 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals 
factors that we consider in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements may result in revisions to costs and income and their effects are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated ultimate loss is accrued 
self insured claims liability 
we retain the risk of loss  up to certain limits  for claims related to automobile liability  general liability  workers compensation  employee group health  and locate damages 
locate damage claims result from property and other damages arising in connection with our services for utility locating 
a liability for unpaid claims and the associated claim expenses  including incurred but not reported losses  is actuarially determined and reflected in the consolidated financial statements as accrued self insured claims 
as of july  
table of contents  the liability for self insured claims and related accrued processing costs was million compared to million at july  based on past experience  we expect million of the amount accrued at july  to be paid in the next months 
we estimate the liability for claims based on facts  circumstances and historical evidence 
when loss reserves are recorded they are not discounted  even though they will not be paid until some time in the future 
factors affecting the determination of the expected cost for existing and incurred but not reported claims include  but are not limited to  the frequency of future claims  the payment pattern of claims which have been incurred  changes in the medical condition of claimants  and other factors such as inflation  tort reform or other legislative changes  unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations 
the increase in accrued self insured claims liability at july  was primarily due to the addition of cable express and prince to our casualty insurance program and the timing of our claim payments 
the following table summarizes our primary insurance coverage and annual retention amounts which  except with respect to workers compensation insurance in three states in which we choose to participate in a state fund  are applicable in all of the states in which we operate dollars in thousands loss retention per occurrence a workers compensation liability claims automobile liability claims  b general liability claims  except utiliquest  llc b general liability claims for utiliquest  llc  b employee health plan claims per participant per annum c stop loss and umbrella coverage d aggregate stop loss coverage for workers compensation  automobile and general liability claims umbrella liability coverage for automobile  general liability  and employer s liability claims a during fiscal  prince and cable express were added to our casualty insurance program at the stated levels 
prior to entering the program  claims for each of these companies related to automobile liability  workers compensation  and their employee health plans were primarily covered under guaranteed cost programs 
for general liability claims  prince previously retained the risk of loss to  per occurrence and cable express retained the risk of loss to  per occurrence 
additionally  prior to joining our insurance program prince and cable express had umbrella liability coverage for automobile  general liability  and employer s liability claims to a policy limit of million and million  respectively 
b in addition  we retain the risk of loss for automobile liability and general liability between million and million on a per occurrence basis 
see note d below for the stop loss relating to this retention layer 
c the loss retention for employee health plan claims per participant per annum was increased to  for fiscal d for fiscal the loss retentions are subject to an aggregate stop loss of million 
in addition  the million to million loss retention layer set forth in note b above is subject to an aggregate stop loss of million 
the estimate for self insured claims liability is subject to uncertainty 
if actual results significantly differ from estimates used to calculate the liability  our financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows could be materially impacted 
goodwill and intangible assets as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
as of july   we had million of goodwill  million of indefinite lived intangible assets and million of finite lived intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization 
the carrying value of goodwill increased by approximately million during fiscal as a result of the acquisition of cable express 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
our reporting units and related intangible assets are tested annually in accordance with sfas no 
during the fourth fiscal 
table of contents quarter of each year to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair market value 
should this be the case  the value of the goodwill or indefinite lived intangibles may be impaired and written down 
goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are also tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below the carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other identifiable intangible asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review finite lived intangible assets for impairment whenever an event occurs or circumstances change which indicates that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair value of the asset compared to its carrying value 
if we determine the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value  an impairment loss is incurred in an amount equal to the difference 
impairment losses  if any  are reflected in operating income or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
we use judgment in assessing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment 
estimates of fair value are based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business or operational strategies 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
generally  we engage third party specialists to assist us with our valuations 
changes in our judgments and projections could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and intangible assets and could result in an impairment 
our goodwill is included in multiple reporting units 
due to the cyclical nature of our business  and the other factors described under risk factors in item a  the profitability of our individual reporting units may periodically suffer from downturns in customer demand and other factors 
these factors may have a disproportionate impact on the individual reporting units as compared to the company as a whole and might adversely affect the fair value of the individual reporting units 
if material adverse conditions occur that impact our reporting units  our future determinations of fair value may not support the carrying amount of one or more of our reporting units  and the related goodwill would need to be written down to an amount considered recoverable 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our can am communications can am reporting unit 
although can am provides services to significant customers  it had underperformed compared to previous expectations due to its inability to achieve projected revenue growth and due to operational inefficiencies at the level of work performed 
management determined that these factors increased the uncertainty surrounding future levels of revenue expected from can am 
we changed the senior management at can am during the later part of fiscal  integrating certain of its operations with another subsidiary of ours  in order to improve operational efficiency 
the combination of the above factors had the effect of reducing the expected future cash flows of the can am reporting unit and are circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
accordingly  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of april  as a result of the impairment analysis  management determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value and  consequently  a goodwill impairment charge was recognized to write off can am s goodwill 
the estimate of fair value of the can am reporting unit was based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
the valuations employed a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value and considered market factors 
as a result of our fiscal annual impairment analysis  we determined that the goodwill of our white mountain cable construction wmcc reporting unit was impaired and consequently recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million during the fourth quarter of fiscal this determination was primarily the result of a change in management s expectations of long term cash flows from reduced work levels for a significant customer  a shift in the timing of expected cash flows from another customer to later periods in our 
table of contents forecast which reduced the present value of the future cash flows from this customer and wmcc s operational underperformance during the fourth quarter of the combination of these factors had an adverse impact on the anticipated future cash flows of the wmcc reporting unit used in the annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the reduced work levels at wmcc were primarily the result of a reduction in demand from a single significant customer 
this was due to the customer s decisions regarding the allocation of their capital spending away from work that management anticipated would be performed by wmcc 
in performing the sfas no 
impairment assessment  management determined that this shift in demand was more than temporary  consequently impacting the seven year period used in our goodwill analysis 
this change in the allocation of capital spending by the customer away from work provided by wmcc did not have an adverse impact on our other subsidiaries 
the historical cash flows of wmcc had been positive  but trended downward during fiscal as wmcc incurred losses 
this negative trend was the result of unanticipated poor operating performance due to unforeseen job site conditions which impacted productivity  an inability to effectively secure and manage subcontractors at acceptable cost and the under absorption of general and administrative expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal management had expected improvements in operating performance as the level of work increased  however  as a result of the factors specified above wmcc incurred an operating loss during the fourth quarter ended july  as a result of these factors  management determined that wmcc would be unable to meet expected profitability measures at the existing work levels which indicated that the anticipated long term cash flows from the business would be materially less than previously expected over the seven year cash flow period used in the sfas no 
impairment analysis 
the estimate of fair value of each of our reporting units was based on our projection of revenues  operating costs  and cash flows considering historical and anticipated future results  general economic and market conditions as well as the impact of planned business and operational strategies 
the valuations employ a combination of present value techniques to measure fair value and consider market factors 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal annual impairment test were a expected cash flow periods of seven years  b terminal values based upon terminal growth rate of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate during the period of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
the key assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units during the fiscal and fiscal impairment tests  including the can am and wmcc impairment tests  were a expected cash flow periods of seven years  b terminal values based upon terminal growth rate of between and  and c a discount rate of which was based on our best estimate during the period of the weighted average cost of capital adjusted for risks associated with the reporting units 
management believes the rates used are consistent with the risks inherent in our business model and with industry discount rates 
changes in our judgments and estimates could result in a significantly different estimate of the fair value of the reporting units and could result in an impairment of goodwill 
a variance in the discount rate used could have had an impact on the amount of goodwill impairment charges recorded 
for example  a change in the discount rate would have caused an increase or decrease in the wmcc goodwill impairment charge in fiscal by approximately million 
the estimated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value for the annual goodwill impairment test in fiscal however  two of the reporting units  one having a goodwill balance of approximately million and the other having a goodwill balance of approximately million  have recently experienced lower demand from the customers they serve compared to historical levels 
as of july   we believe the goodwill is recoverable for all of the reporting units  however  there can be no assurances that the goodwill will not be impaired in future periods 
stock based compensation 
our stock based award programs are intended to attract  retain and reward talented employees  officers and directors  and to align stockholder and employee interests 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  share based payment  which amended sfas no 
sfas no 
r requires that share based awards granted to employees be fair valued on the date of grant  with limited exceptions  and the related expense recognized over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period of the award 
sfas no 
r became effective for us on july   the first day of fiscal prior to fiscal  we accounted for stock based compensation under accounting 
table of contents principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 
which required recognition of compensation expense using the intrinsic value method  whereby compensation expense was determined as the excess of the market value of the underlying stock over the exercise price of the option at the measurement date 
beginning july   we applied the modified prospective application of sfas no 
r to all of our stock based awards 
additionally  beginning in fiscal we shifted from granting stock options to our employees and officers to granting time based and performance based restricted shares and restricted share units see note  stock based awards in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for performance based awards  in accordance with sfas no 
r  compensation cost must be recognized over the requisite service period if it is probable that the performance goal will be satisfied 
we use our best judgment to determine whether it is probable the performance goals will be satisfied at each reporting period and record compensation costs accordingly  however  the recognition or non recognition of such compensation cost remains subject to uncertainty 
as of july   the maximum total unrecognized compensation expense and weighted average period over which the expense would be recognized is shown below 
for performance based awards  the unrecognized compensation cost is based upon the maximum amount of restricted share and restricted share units that can be earned under outstanding awards 
if the performance goals are not met  no compensation expense will be recognized for these shares units and any compensation expense recognized previously for those shares units will be reversed 
unrecognized weighted compensation average expense period in thousands in years stock options unvested time vesting shares units unvested performance vesting shares units during the first quarter of fiscal  in response to a public letter to financial executives international and the american institute of certified public accountants from the office of the chief accountant of the securities and exchange commission dated september   we initiated a voluntary review of our stock based award granting practices covering the period from august  the first day of fiscal through october  we found that the number and exercise price of all stock based awards were approved by the applicable committee of the board of directors 
additionally  no instances of intentional back dating of equity awards nor any evidence of fraud or manipulative conduct associated with our granting practices was discovered during this review 
however  in some instances  primarily associated with annual grants  the administrative activities necessary to complete the allocation of stock options to individual employees were not final at the grant date 
apb no 
provides that the measurement date of an award can not occur until the number of shares that the individual employee is entitled to receive is also finalized 
pursuant to apb no 
 proper measurement dates were not applied for certain awards as the administrative activities related to the allocation of the stock options to employees had not been finalized as of the grant date 
during our voluntary review  we considered the available information related to each of the stock based awards and applied judgment in determining the appropriate measurement date 
in certain instances  the stock price increased from the grant date to the measurement date which resulted in additional non cash stock based compensation expense 
we have determined the impact to the consolidated operating results of applying the new measurement date to the awards would not change fiscal results  but would reduce fiscal results by approximately million  net of taxes 
for each year between fiscal through fiscal  the impact of the non cash stock based compensation expense  net of taxes  was less than million per year with no impact upon fiscal pursuant to the footnote disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we determined the pro forma non cash stock based compensation expense would decrease by approximately million for fiscal resulting in an increase in pro forma net income 
for fiscal through fiscal  we determined the footnote disclosure of pro forma non cash stock based compensation expense and pro forma net income loss would change by less than million on an annual basis 

table of contents we have determined that the impact of the above amounts is not material to net income loss  earnings loss per share  additional paid in capital  retained earnings and pro forma disclosures for all periods between fiscal through fiscal and with respect to the trends in earnings 
the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  consolidated statements of stockholder s equity  and consolidated statements of cash flows for fiscal includes an increase of million  net of taxes  for non cash stock based compensation expense 
the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of july  includes an adjustment of million to increase additional paid in capital and decrease retained earnings from the amounts previously reported reflecting the cumulative impact of the non cash stock based compensation expense  net of taxes 
we have advised our external auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors of the results of our review 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment regarding the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets and accruals for uncertain tax positions 
we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of july  because management believes that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefits of those assets as the temporary basis differences reverse over time 
our judgments are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
while we believe that we have provided adequately for our income tax liabilities in the consolidated financial statements  adverse determinations by taxing authorities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations  and cash flows 
in june  fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a two step process for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the first step involves evaluation of a tax position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the second step involves measuring the benefit to recognize in the financial statements for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
the provisions of fin are effective for us beginning on july   the first day of fiscal we are currently evaluating the impact of fin allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management analyzes the collectability of accounts receivable balances on a regular basis 
this review considers the aging of account balances  historical bad debt experience  changes in customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  customer payment activity and other relevant factors 
should any of these factors change  the estimate made by management may also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when it is probable that a receivable is not collectable and the loss can be reasonably estimated 
we believe that none of our significant customers are experiencing significant financial difficulty as of july  any increase in the allowance account has a corresponding negative effect on our results of operations 
contingencies and litigation 
in the ordinary course of our business  we are involved in certain legal proceedings 
sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
in determining whether a loss should be accrued we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
if only a range of probable loss can be determined  we accrue for our best estimate within the range for the contingency 
in those cases where none of the estimates within the range is better than another  we accrue for the amount representing the low end of the range in accordance with sfas no 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the potential liability related to our pending contingencies and litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions of our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operations 
additionally  if the final outcome of such litigation and contingencies differs adversely from that currently expected  it would result in a charge to earnings when determined 

table of contents a number of our competitors have been subject to class action lawsuits alleging violations of the fair labor standards act and state wage and hour laws 
a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants 
we have been contacted by counsel representing current and former employees alleging similar violations at certain of our subsidiaries 
these subsidiaries currently employ approximately  persons 
in an effort to avoid the expense of class action litigation and to timely resolve this matter  the parties have engaged a third party to mediate discussions 
additionally  two former employees of apex  a wholly owned subsidiary that was discontinued during fiscal  commenced a lawsuit alleging that apex violated certain minimum wage laws and overtime pay requirements 
the plaintiffs seek to certify  and eventually notify  a class consisting of certain former employees of apex 
we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against this lawsuit 
regardless of whether any of the foregoing allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately determined to be liable  these claims may be expensive to defend and or settle and may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and cash flows 
from time to time  the company and certain of its subsidiaries are also party to various claims and legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
it is the opinion of our management  based on information available at this time  that none of such pending normal course of business claims or legal proceedings will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

this increase was primarily the result of approximately million and million  respectively  of additional work for two significant telephone customers maintaining and upgrading their respective networks  and million of additional revenue from a significant customer engaged in a fiber deployment project 
in addition  revenue increased by approximately million for installation  maintenance and construction services provided to several cable multiple system operators  including work performed on the former adelphia network assets acquired by certain of those customers

total revenues from underground utility line locating for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  a decrease of 
during fiscal  we earned approximately million for utility locating relating to hurricane restoration services 
we did not perform any hurricane restoration services during fiscal the remaining decrease is a result of a decrease in the volume of work performed for both existing and new customers  including the termination of a contract for a telephone customer in january 
table of contents our total revenues from electric utilities and other construction and maintenance services increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to the fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to additional work performed for both existing and new customers  including on going gas pipeline construction primarily for one customer 
costs of earned revenues 
costs of earned revenues increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary components of this increase were direct labor and subcontractor costs taken together  other direct costs  and direct materials  which increased million  million  and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to higher levels of operations during fiscal  including the operations of cable express and prince since their acquisitions in september and december  respectively 
as a percentage of contract revenues  costs of earned revenues decreased for fiscal  as compared to the same period last year 
labor and labor related costs decreased as a percent of contract revenues primarily as a result of less subcontracted labor in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decline was due to less subcontracted labor as a percentage of revenues in fiscal as compared to fiscal  primarily as a result of the prince and cable express acquisitions 
decreases in other direct costs contributed of the total percent decrease primarily due to reduced vehicle rental  travel and other direct costs compared to higher amounts incurred during fiscal in connection with the hurricane restoration services and decreases in insurance costs as a result of reduced loss development activity for self insured claims during fiscal these reductions were partially offset by increases in group health insurance costs and higher fuel costs 
we also experienced an increase of in direct materials due to an increase in the number of projects for which we provided materials to the customer during as compared to fiscal general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase in total general and administrative expenses for fiscal compared to the prior year period was primarily attributable to the general and administrative costs of cable express and prince  which were acquired in september and december  respectively  increased legal and professional fees  increased payroll and related expenses as a result of the growth of our business in fiscal  and an increase in stock based compensation expenses as a result of the restricted stock awards granted during fiscal and the total amount of stock based compensation expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues were for each of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million for fiscal from million for fiscal and increased as a percentage of contract revenues to compared to from fiscal year the dollar amount of the increase for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily a result of increased capital expenditures and the addition of fixed assets and amortizing intangible assets relating to the acquisitions of cable express and prince in september and december  respectively 
goodwill impairment charge 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our can am reporting unit 
although can am provides services to significant customers  it had underperformed compared to previous expectations due to its inability to achieve projected revenue growth and due to operational inefficiencies at the level of work performed 
management determined that these factors increased the uncertainty surrounding future levels of revenue expected from can am 
we changed the senior management at can am during the later part of fiscal  integrating certain of its operations with another of our subsidiaries in order to improve operational efficiency 
the combination of the above factors had the effect of reducing the expected future cash flows of the can am reporting unit and were circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
accordingly  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of april  as a result of the impairment analysis  management determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value and  as a result  a goodwill impairment charge was recognized to write off can am s goodwill 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease is primarily a result of lower cash balances as compared to prior year due to the fiscal and fiscal acquisitions of cable express  cavo  and prince  and due to higher amounts of capital expenditures in fiscal

this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in revenue from a significant customer engaged in a fiber deployment project and due to a decrease in revenue from another significant customer that completed an upgrade project to their network in fiscal the decrease was partially offset by a net increase of million for hurricane restoration services performed in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and from revenues from new contracts with existing customers 
total revenues from underground utility line locating for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal  an increase of 
this increase is primarily the result of additional work performed for existing customers and work performed related to the hurricanes that impacted the southeastern united states during the later part of calendar our total revenues from electric utilities and other construction and maintenance services increased million  or  in fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to work pursuant to a specific customer contract that commenced in the later part of fiscal  which we completed during the first half of fiscal  and additional work performed for both existing and new customers 
costs of earned revenues 
costs of earned revenues increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the primary components of this dollar increase were equipment and other direct costs  direct labor and subcontractor costs taken together  and direct materials  which increased million  million  and million  respectively 
these increases were primarily due to higher levels of operations during fiscal  including the operations of prince since its acquisition in december as a percentage of contract revenues  costs of earned revenues increased for fiscal  as compared to fiscal increases for equipment and other direct costs contributed of the increase  primarily due to increased overall insurance costs as a result of higher premiums and loss development activity for self insured claims  and increased fuel and rental costs for our vehicles and equipment 
direct materials increased due to an increase in the number of projects for which we provided materials to the customer during as compared to fiscal these increases were partially offset by a decrease as a percentage of contract revenues of in direct labor and subcontracted labor  combined  primarily as a result of less subcontracted labor in fiscal as compared to the fiscal  which enabled us to reduce our total labor costs in proportion to our contract revenues 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the increase in total general and administrative expenses for fiscal was primarily a result of an increase in stock based compensation expenses compared to fiscal as a result of sfas no 
r implementation and from general and administrative costs of prince  which was acquired in december these dollar amount increases were partially offset by decreased 
table of contents professional fees primarily as a result of a reduction in sarbanes oxley related costs  as fiscal was the first year of implementation  and improved bad debt experience during fiscal compared to fiscal the total amount of stock based compensation expense for fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal the million in stock based compensation expense for fiscal includes a pre tax adjustment of million for additional stock based compensation expense as a result of a voluntary review of our stock based award granting practices covering the period from august  the first day of fiscal through october  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the general increase in stock based compensation resulted from applying sfas no 
r to our unvested stock options outstanding and restricted stock awards granted to employees and officers in december prior to sfas no 
r we accounted for stock based compensation under apb no 
and only certain of our awards resulted in compensation expense 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we now recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards over the vesting period 
our restricted stock grants are also accounted for under sfas no 
r and we have recognized compensation expense based on the fair value at the date of grant over the requisite service periods of the awards 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues were and in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of contract revenues is primarily a result of the effect of the prince acquisition  which increased contract revenues at a greater rate than its increase to general and administrative costs 
we also incurred lower sarbanes oxley related costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal  which contributed to the percentage decrease in general and administrative expenses 
offsetting the decline in general and administrative costs as a percentage of contract revenue was million of stock based compensation expense in fiscal due to implementation of sfas no 
r as compared to million in fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and decreased as a percentage of contract revenues to in fiscal from in fiscal the dollar amount of the increase for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily a result of the addition of fixed assets and amortizing intangibles relating to the acquisition of prince in december these increases were partially offset by fixed assets becoming fully depreciated during the period 
the percentage decrease is a result of million in increased revenues on slightly increased depreciation costs 
goodwill impairment charge 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our can am reporting unit 
although can am provides services to significant customers  it had underperformed compared to previous expectations due to its inability to achieve projected revenue growth and due to operational inefficiencies at existing levels of work 
can am began incurring operating losses during fiscal  primarily as a result of poor performance on existing contracts due to high job management costs during the period of reduced work levels 
in addition  can am failed to achieve projected revenue growth due to declines in demand from existing customers and its inability to secure new customer work at pricing levels sufficient to offset operating costs 
we changed the senior management at can am during the later part of fiscal  integrating certain of its operations with another of our subsidiaries in order to improve operational efficiency 
however  we were uncertain of the time period that the changes will take to improve the performance of can am and the extent to which the changes may be effective 
while management does not expect can am to generate material losses in future periods  we determined that the anticipated cash flows from new opportunities were subject to a higher degree of uncertainty than previously anticipated and that future cash flows would not likely be sufficient to support the carrying value of can am s goodwill balance 
the combination of the above factors had the effect of reducing the expected future cash flows of the can am reporting unit over the seven year period used in our sfas no 
impairment analysis and are circumstances that we determined would be more likely than not to reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount 
accordingly  we performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of april  as a result of the impairment analysis  management determined that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was less than its carrying value and  consequently  a goodwill impairment charge was recognized to write off can am s goodwill 
during fiscal  we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of approximately million related to our wmcc reporting unit as a result of our fiscal annual impairment analysis 
this determination was primarily the result of a change in management s expectations of long term cash flows from reduced work levels for a 
table of contents significant customer  a shift in the timing of expected cash flows from another customer to later periods in our forecast which reduced the present value of the future cash flows from this customer and wmcc s operational underperformance during the fourth quarter of the combination of these factors had an adverse impact on the anticipated future cash flows of the wmcc reporting unit used in the annual impairment analysis performed during the fourth quarter of fiscal the reduced work levels at wmcc were primarily the result of a reduction in demand from a single significant customer 
this was due to the customer s decisions regarding the allocation of their capital spending away from work that management anticipated would be performed by wmcc 
in performing the sfas no 
impairment assessment  management determined that this shift in demand was more than temporary  consequently impacting the seven year period used in our goodwill analysis 
this change in the allocation of capital spending by the customer away from work provided by wmcc did not have an adverse impact on other subsidiaries of ours 
the historical cash flows of wmcc had been positive  but trended downward during fiscal as wmcc incurred losses 
this negative trend was the result of unanticipated poor operating performance due to unforeseen job site conditions which impacted productivity  an inability to effectively secure and manage subcontractors at acceptable cost and the under absorption of general and administrative expenses 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal management had expected improvements in operating performance as the level of work increased  however  as a result of the factors specified above wmcc incurred an operating loss during the fourth quarter ended july  as a result of these factors  management determined that wmcc would be unable to meet expected profitability measures at the existing work levels which indicated that the anticipated long term cash flows from the business would be materially less than previously expected over the seven year cash flow period used in the sfas no 
impairment analysis 
although we made operational changes in an effort to improve the performance and profitability of wmcc and management did not expect wmcc to generate material losses in future periods  we were uncertain of the time period that the changes would take to improve the performance and the extent to which the changes may be effective 
interest income 
interest income increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase for fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily a result of higher interest rates during fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the increase is due to the issuance of million of notes and million of borrowings from our credit facility 
the issuance of the notes and the borrowing from our credit facility were used to purchase million shares of our common stock in october and used in connection with our acquisition of prince in december the million in borrowing from our credit facility has subsequently been repaid 
other income  net 
other income decreased to million for fiscal as compared to million for fiscal the decrease was primarily a result of a lesser number of assets sold during fiscal as compared to fiscal income taxes 
the following table presents our income tax expense and effective income tax rate for continuing operations for fiscal and fiscal dollars in millions fiscal year ended july  july  income taxes effective income tax rate our effective income tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was significantly higher than the applicable statutory rates in the jurisdictions where we operate as a result of the non cash goodwill impairment charges of million and million in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
those impairment charges are not deductible for income tax purposes 
other variations in our tax rate are primarily attributable to the impact of other non deductible and non taxable items for tax purposes in relation to a lower pre tax income during fiscal as compared to fiscal

the following table presents our results from discontinued operations for fiscal and dollars in millions fiscal year ended dollars in thousands contract revenues of discontinued operations income loss of discontinued operations before income taxes income loss of discontinued operations  net of tax the decrease in income from discontinued operations was primarily a result of increased costs of apex to provide services to its primary customer during the later part of fiscal as compared to relatively stable contract revenues

table of contents interest payments on our notes and borrowings and to support our normal replacement of equipment at our current level of business for at least the next twelve months 
our future operating results and cash flows may be affected by a number of factors including our success in bidding on future contracts and our ability to manage costs effectively 
to the extent we seek to grow by acquisitions that involve consideration other than our stock  our capital requirements may increase 
backlog 
our backlog consists of the uncompleted portion of services to be performed under job specific contracts and the estimated value of future services that we expect to provide under long term requirements contracts  including master service agreements 
many of our contracts are multi year agreements  and we include in our backlog the amount of services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts based on our historical experience with customers and  more generally our experience in procurements of this type 
in many instances  our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract 
for certain multi year projects relating to fiber deployments for one of our significant customers  we have included in the july  backlog amounts relating to anticipated work through the remainder of calendar year these fiber deployment projects  when initially installed  are not required for the day to day provision of services by that customer 
consequently  the fiber deployment projects of this customer generally have been subject to more uncertainty  as compared to those of our other customers  with regards to activity levels 
our estimates of a customer s requirements during a particular future period may not be accurate at any point in time 
our backlog at july  and july  was billion and billion  respectively 
we expect to complete approximately of our current backlog during the next twelve months 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our revenues are affected by seasonality as a significant portion of the work we perform is outdoors 
consequently  our operations are impacted by extended periods of inclement weather 
generally  inclement weather is more likely to occur during the winter season which falls during our second and third fiscal quarters 
in addition  a disproportionate percentage of total paid holidays fall within our second quarter  which decreases the number of available workdays 
additionally  our customer premise equipment installation activities for cable providers historically decreases around calendar year end holidays as their customers generally require less activity during this period 
in addition  we have experienced and expect to continue to experience quarterly variations in revenues and net income as a result of other factors  including the timing and volume of customers construction and maintenance projects  seasonal budgetary spending patterns of customers  the commencement or termination of master service agreements and other long term agreements with customers  costs incurred to support growth internally or through acquisitions  fluctuation in results of operations caused by acquisitions  fluctuation in the employer portion of payroll taxes as a result of reaching the limitation on social security withholdings and unemployment requirements  changes in mix of customers  contracts  and business activities  fluctuations in stock based compensation expense as a result of the timing and vesting period of stock based awards granted fluctuations in other income as a result of the timing and levels of capital assets sold during the period  and fluctuations in insurance expense due to changes in claims experience and actuarial assumptions 
accordingly  operating results for any fiscal period are not necessarily indicative of results that may be achieved for any subsequent fiscal period
