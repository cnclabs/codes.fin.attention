table of contents community bank lending commercial real estate lending 
united western bank originates commercial real estate loans that are generally secured by one or more of the following kinds of properties multifamily residential property  owner and non owner occupied commercial and industrial property  and single tenant property 
these loans also include sba loans and a loans 
the loans are generally made at variable rates that change daily or quarterly based on changes in the prime rate or libor  although some are made at fixed rates 
terms of up to years are offered primarily on sba loans  but most loans are structured with a balloon payment at the end of approximately five years or amortize over a period of up to years 
in deciding whether to make a commercial real estate loan  the bank considers  among other things  the experience and qualifications of the borrower as well as the value and anticipated cash flow of the underlying property 
some additional factors considered are net operating income of the property before debt service and depreciation  the debt service coverage ratio the ratio of the property s free cash flow to debt service requirements  the ratio of the loan amount to the appraised value and cost  and the recourse to the overall creditworthiness of the prospective borrower 
the bank s commercial real estate loans typically range in size from  to million  which is below the bank s legal lending limit of approximately million 
commercial real estate lending typically involves higher principal amounts than certain other types of loans and the repayment of the loans generally is dependent  in large part  on the successful operations of the property collateralizing the loan or the business conducted on the property collateralizing the loan 
these loans may therefore be more adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the economy in general 
for example  if the cash flow from the borrower s project is reduced due to leases not being obtained or renewed  the borrower s ability to repay the loan may be impaired 
in addition  many commercial real estate loans are not fully amortized over the loan period  but have balloon payments due at maturity 
a borrower s ability to make a balloon payment typically will depend on being able to either refinance the loan or complete a timely sale of the underlying property 
residential and commercial construction and development lending 
united western bank provides construction and development loans for the development of land and vertical construction of condominiums  one to four family  and multifamily residences 
loans are also provided for the development of land and vertical construction for retail and other commercial purposes 
land development loans share many of the same risks as discussed above with commercial real estate loans 
construction lending involves additional risks because funds are advanced upon the security of the project  which is of uncertain value prior to its completion 
because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating construction costs  as well as the market value of the completed project and the effects of governmental regulation of real property  it is relatively difficult to evaluate accurately the total funds required to complete a project and the related loan to value and loan to cost ratios 
as a result  construction loans often involve the disbursement of substantial funds with repayment dependent  in large part  on the success of the completion of the ultimate project and the ability of the borrower to sell or lease the property or refinance the indebtedness  rather than the ability of the borrower or guarantor to repay principal and interest 
if the appraisal of the value of the completed project proves to be overstated  the bank may have inadequate security for the repayment of the loan upon completion of construction of the project and may incur a loss 
accordingly  the bank generally requires the personal guaranty of the borrower on residential and commercial construction and development lending 
commercial lending 
united western bank makes commercial loans to small and middle market businesses 
the borrowers tend to be privately owned and are generally service providers  long term health care operators  distributors  and manufacturers 
the loan products offered are primarily working capital and term loans and lines of credit that help customers finance accounts receivable  inventory and equipment 
these loans are typically guaranteed by the owners of the business 
the collateral securing commercial loans may depreciate over time  may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business 
in addition  in the case of loans secured by accounts receivable  the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent upon the ability of the borrower to collect the amounts due from its customers 
accordingly  the bank makes commercial loans primarily based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower 
generally commercial loans are made at variable rates that fluctuate with the prime rate 
small business administration lending 
in may  the bank s sba division was named to participate nationally in the preferred lenders program plp of the united states small business administration 
previously  united western bank was a plp participant across six designated districts including colorado  idaho  arizona  texas  oregon and washington 
with the elevation to national plp status  united western bank is now able to participate in the plp nationally  which encompasses districts spanning states 
the bank originates sba loans and a loans 
under the sba program  the bank provides  in conjunction with a certified development company cdc  a conventional loan collateralized by a first lien on commercial real estate or equipment 
the 
table of contents sba program provides for an sba guarantee of debentures issued for up to a maximum of of the eligible project costs  which is subordinated to the primary mortgage originated by the bank 
under the sba s a program  loans in excess of  and up to  are guaranteed by the sba 
generally  this guarantee may become invalid only if the loan does not meet the sba underwriting  documentation  and servicing guidelines 
loans under  are guaranteed by the sba 
sba a loans  collateralized by real estate  have terms of up to years  while loans collateralized by equipment and working capital have terms of up to years and years  respectively 
a minimum down payment of is required on most a loans  but a larger down payment may be required when the real estate collateral consists of a special purpose or single use property such as a motel or service station 
new market tax credits lending 
new market tax credits nmtc are awarded under a program administered by the community development financial institutions fund a division of the united states department of treasury 
the nmtc program permits taxpayers investors to claim a credit against federal income taxes for each qualified equity investment qei made to a designated community development entity 
the investor receives a tax credit over a seven year period  in the amount of in years one through three  and in years four through seven 
in  united western bank acquired million tax credits through a million qualifying equity investment it made to a owned subsidiary  community development funding i  llc cdf i 
cdf i used the investment proceeds to originate loans eligible under the nmtc program through the bank 
on december   the bank invested million in charter facilities funding iv  llc  a owned subsidiary of the bank and received tax credits of million 
charter facilities funding iv  llc used the investment proceeds to originate loans eligible under the nmtc program through the bank on december   the bank made an additional investment of million to charter facilities funding iv  llc  making the bank eligible for an additional million of tax credits 
the additional investment proceeds are being used to make eligible nmtc loans through the bank 
at december   the bank has million of new market tax credits loans outstanding and is required to make additional new market tax credit loans of million prior to december to avoid tax credit recapture 
new market tax credit loans are generally commercial real estate loans in designated community development areas low income areas made in accordance with the bank s and community development entities lending policies and in accordance with the rules of the new market tax credit program 
these loans are generally fixed rate and generally there is a concession in the rate as compared to the remainder of the bank s general loan portfolio 
the loans also have longer terms  often to years  with an initial period of seven years interest only followed by amortization to maturity 
these loans are included with commercial real estate loans in our tables and financial statements and the underlying collateral is commercial property 
consumer lending 
the bank s consumer lending portfolio is primarily focused on home equity lines of credit and to a limited extent  credit card  auto  and unsecured consumer loans 
home equity lines of credit are generally extended up to of the appraised value of the property  less existing liens  generally at variable interest rates based on prime  the federal reserve board target rate for overnight borrowings  or libor 
the bank uses the same underwriting standards for home equity lines of credit as it uses for residential real estate loans 
consumer loans typically have shorter terms and lower balances with higher yields as compared to residential real estate loans  but generally carry higher risks of default 
consumer loan collections are dependent on the borrower s continuing financial stability  and thus  are more likely to be affected by adverse personal circumstances 
furthermore  the application of various federal and state laws  including bankruptcy and insolvency laws  may limit the amount that can be recovered on these loans 
wholesale lending single family residence lending 
united western bank owns approximately million of single family residential whole loans 
the overwhelming majority of these loans were purchased by the bank in the secondary market  a small portion of these loans were originated by matrix financial prior to its exit from the loan production business in february  and another small portion of these loans represent loans purchased from matrix financial s servicing portfolio 
prior to our change in business strategy  the bank regularly reviewed loan portfolios for prospective acquisition  however  the bank has not purchased any such loan portfolios since september these portfolios were typically first lien priority loans secured primarily by to single family residential properties most of which were adjustable rate loans 
united western bank would purchase mortgage loan portfolios from various sellers who had either originated the loans or acquired the loan portfolios from others in bulk purchases 
united western bank would consider several factors prior to a purchase  including the product type  the current loan balance  the current interest rate environment  the seasoning of the mortgage loans  payment histories  geographic location of the underlying collateral  price  yield  the current liquidity of the bank and the product mix in its existing mortgage loan portfolio 
in addition  the various sellers were evaluated for their ability to perform under the representations and warranties that would be provided to the bank at the time of purchase 

table of contents united western bank performed due diligence on each mortgage loan portfolio that it desired to purchase 
these procedures consisted of analyzing all or  in some instances  a representative sample of the mortgage loans in the portfolio and were typically performed by united western bank employees  but occasionally were outsourced to third party contractors 
the underwriter took into account many factors and statistics in analyzing the mortgage loans in the subject portfolio  including the general economic conditions in the geographic area or areas in which the underlying residential properties are located  the loan to value ratios and quality of the valuations on the underlying loan collateral  the payment histories of the borrowers  as well as their income and credit worthiness 
in addition  the underwriter attempted to verify that each sample loan conforms to the standards for loan documentation set by the secondary market for investment grade mortgages 
in cases where a significant portion of the sample loans contained nonconforming documentation  united western bank assessed the additional risk involved in purchasing the loans 
this process helped united western bank determine whether the mortgage loan portfolio met its investment criteria and  if it did  the range of pricing that was appropriate 
purchased sba guaranteed loans 
united western bank owns approximately million of guaranteed portions of sba a loans that it acquired in the secondary market 
the loans are adjustable rate and generally reset quarterly with changes in the prime rate 
the bank purchases guaranteed portions of sba loans from various sellers  typically the originator of the loan who retains the unguaranteed portion and continues to service the loan 
however  from time to time the bank has purchased guaranteed portions of sba loans from other market participants 
historically the bank pooled these loans as permitted by the sba into sba pooled securities through the use of a fiscal and transfer agent approved by the sba 
the certificates were then sold directly to institutional investors  achieving legal isolation 
the process of securitizing sba loans into pools of sba certificates is prescribed by the sba and must be followed to maintain the sba guarantee 
we temporarily suspended this business line in march through november in december  we reentered this business line  however  currently the interest rate yield curve and the price that other participants are willing to pay to acquire newly originated loans has limited our ability to purchase a significant amount of loans at levels that we deem prudent 
other activities related to lending sales of loans 
united western bank sells in the secondary market certain of the sba loans it originates 
the bank has sold single family loans either outright or after securitization with a governmental sponsored agency and then sold the created security 
in prior years the bank also sold multifamily loans 
during the year ended december   the bank sold million of single family loans that primarily were acquired through purchases from its servicing portfolio 
the bank sold securities it created from single family loans that had been previously purchased in the secondary market totaling million 
the bank sold approximately million of originated sba loans 
the bank may sell sba loans from time to time to manage industry exposures  interest rate risk and for current income 
the sale of loans may generate a gain or loss for the bank 
gains or losses result primarily from two factors 
first  the bank may make a loan to a borrower at a rate resulting in a price that is higher or lower than it would receive if the bank had immediately sold the loan in the secondary market 
these price differences occur primarily as a result of competitive pricing conditions in the market place 
second  gains or losses may result from changes in interest rates that consequently change the market value of loans originated for sale 
self directed trust and custody activities self directed trust and custody services 
the company s self directed trust and custody activities are provided through sterling 
trust and custodial activities were also performed at united western bank through april   when the trust department of united western bank was sold 
sterling provides administrative services for self directed individual retirement accounts  qualified business retirement plans and personal custodial accounts  as well as corporate escrow and paying agent services 
in addition  sterling offers specialized custody and clearing services to investment professionals 
these services are marketed on a nationwide basis to the financial services industry  specifically broker dealers  registered representatives  financial planners and advisors  tax professionals  insurance agents and investment product sponsors 
the advantage offered by sterling is the ability to hold a wide array of publicly traded investments  as well as nonstandard assets and private placement offerings 

table of contents at december   sterling had approximately  accounts with assets under administration of approximately billion 
as of december   approximately million of the billion represented deposits held at united western bank 
sterling does not offer financial planning or advising services  nor does it recommend  sell or solicit any investments 
sterling acts only as a directed custodian and is not affiliated with any investment 
it has always been sterling s mission to keep this independence to ensure that high quality services are offered without any conflicting interests 
sterling executes no investment transaction without the direction of the account holder or the account holder s authorized representative 
during  united western bank expanded the variety and depth of its trust services  primarily by partnering with our former joint venture partner  matrix settlement clearance services  in providing trust and custodial services to third party administrators  broker dealers and banks 
we sold our interest in matrix settlement and clearance services  during the fourth quarter of  and agreed to sell the assets of the trust operations of united western bank  on april  the sale of the trust operations generated a gain on sale of  included in other income for the year ended december  the clearing and custody services provided by matrix settlement and clearance services and the former trust operations of united western bank continue to generate deposits for united western bank 
as part of the sale agreement  deposits have been maintained at united western bank after the sale and at december   deposits maintained by mg colorado holdings  inc at united western bank totaled approximately million 
the agreement to maintain these deposits at the bank expired on september   but the bank is currently in negotiations with matrix settlement and clearance services and its affiliates to renew this agreement 
as of the date of this annual report  the bank maintains an arrangement with matrix settlement and clearance services as if the agreement had not expired 
management presently expects the agreement to be renewed on terms substantially equivalent to the expired agreement 
brokerage services first matrix investment services corp 
first matrix is registered with the nasd as a fully disclosed broker dealer  headquartered in denver  colorado 
first matrix primarily provides brokerage services through sba pooling and structured finance transactions 
first matrix  as agent for united western bank  purchases the guaranteed portion of sba a loans from bank and non bank lenders around the country 
these loans are assembled and later pooled into sba securities that are sold into the secondary market to institutional and sophisticated investors 
this trading strategy enables the bank to earn attractive yields on high credit quality assets with reduced exposure to the traditional risks associated with investing in any commercial loan assets 
in addition  first matrix brokers the sale of fixed income securities to institutional clients 
mortgage servicing activities residential mortgage loan servicing 
historically  we conducted our residential mortgage loan servicing activities through matrix financial  including the residential mortgage loan servicing that matrix financial provided as subservicer for united western bank s servicing portfolio 
in november  matrix financial transferred the servicing function to a third party subservicer 
the servicing transfer was done in an effort to lower the overall cost of servicing by eliminating many of the fixed costs of servicing the loans in house 
matrix financial pays the subservicer a fixed fee per loan that varies based on whether the loan is a fixed rate or adjustable rate  or if the loan is delinquent 
as part of the agreement  the custodial deposits are maintained at united western bank 
we have retained a small staff at matrix financial primarily to monitor the servicing activities of the subservicer 
at december   including loans owned by matrix financial and united western bank  matrix financial serviced through the subservicer  approximately billion of mortgage loans 
servicing mortgage loans involves a contractual right to receive a fee for collecting  processing and administering loan payments 
this processing involves collecting monthly mortgage payments on behalf of investors  reporting information to those investors on a monthly basis and maintaining custodial escrow accounts for the payment of principal and interest to investors and property taxes and insurance premiums on behalf of borrowers 
these payments are held in custodial escrow accounts at united western bank 

table of contents as compensation for its mortgage servicing activities  matrix financial receives servicing fees  plus any late charges collected from delinquent borrowers and other fees incidental to the services provided 
in the event of default by the borrower  matrix financial receives no servicing fees until the default is cured 
at december   matrix financial s annual weighted average servicing fee was of the unpaid principal balance outstanding on each mortgage 
servicing is provided on mortgage loans on a recourse or nonrecourse basis 
matrix financial s policy is to accept only a limited number of servicing assets on a recourse basis 
as of december   on the basis of outstanding principal balances  approximately of its owned mortgage servicing contracts involved recourse servicing 
to the extent that servicing is done on a recourse basis  matrix financial is exposed to credit risk with respect to the underlying loan in the event of a default 
additionally  many of its nonrecourse mortgage servicing contracts owned require matrix financial to advance all or part of the scheduled payments to the owner of the mortgage loan in the event of a default by the borrower 
many owners of mortgage loans also require the servicer to advance insurance premiums and tax payments on schedule even though sufficient escrow funds may not be available 
therefore  matrix financial must bear the funding costs associated with making such advances 
if the delinquent loan does not become current  these advances are typically recovered at the time of the foreclosure sale 
foreclosure expenses  which may include legal fees or property maintenance expenses  are generally not fully reimbursable by fannie mae  freddie mac or ginnie mae  for which agencies matrix financial provides significant amounts of mortgage loan servicing 
as of december   matrix financial had advanced approximately million in funds on behalf of third party investors 
matrix financial may incur normal curtailments of certain advances on loans serviced for gnma and fnma 
generally advances on behalf of private investors are fully collectible 
for the va loans sold and serviced for ginnie mae  which are sold on a nonrecourse basis  the va loan guarantees may not cover the entire principal balance and  in that case  matrix financial is responsible for the losses which exceed the va s guarantee 
estimated losses related to foreclosure and other servicer advances are estimated and reserved for  and included in the consolidated financial statements 
competition united western bank faces substantial competition in all phases of its operations  including loan originations and deposit account originations  from a variety of competitors 
there is significant competition among commercial banks in the bank s market area 
as a result of the deregulation of the financial services industry see the discussion of the gramm leach bliley act of in the section of this item captioned regulation and supervision  united western bank also competes with other providers of financial services  such as credit unions  consumer finance companies  securities firms  insurance companies  insurance agencies  commercial finance and leasing companies  full service brokerage firms and discount brokerage firms 
some of united western bank s competitors have greater resources and  as such  may have higher lending limits and may offer other services that are not provided by the bank 
united western bank generally competes on the basis of customer service and responsiveness to customer needs  available loan and deposit products  the rates of interest charged on loans  and the rates of interest paid for funds 
the bank does not compete by lessening its credit quality standards 
sterling faces considerable competition in all of the services and products that it offers  mainly from other self directed trust companies  broker dealers and third party administrators 
sterling also faces competition from other trust companies and trust divisions of financial institutions 
sterling s niche has been  and will continue to be  providing high quality customer service and servicing nonstandard retirement products 
in an effort to increase market share  sterling endeavors to provide superior service  offer technologically advanced solutions  expand its marketing efforts  provide competitive pricing and continue to diversify its product mix 
if sterling is unable to attract and retain customers in its trust operations  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected

united western bancorp 
we are a unitary savings and loan holding company within the meaning of the home owners loan act  as amended 
as such  we are subject to office of thrift supervision ots regulation  examination  supervision and reporting requirements 
in addition  the ots has enforcement authority over us and our savings bank and non savings bank subsidiaries

as a unitary savings and loan holding company that has been in existence prior to may   we generally are not restricted under existing laws as to the types of business activities in which we may engage  provided that united western bank continues to be a qualified thrift lender under the home owners loan act 
to maintain its status as a qualified thrift lender  the bank must maintain a minimum percentage of its assets in qualified thrift investments unless the ots grants an exception to this requirement 
in general  qualified thrift investments include certain types of residential mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and certain loans to small businesses 
if we acquire control of another savings association as a separate subsidiary  we would become a multiple savings and loan holding company 
multiple savings and loan holding companies may only engage in those activities permissible for a financial holding company under the bank holding company act of  as amended 
generally  financial holding companies may only engage in activities such as banking  insurance and securities activities  as well as merchant banking activities under certain circumstances 
in addition  if united western bank fails to maintain its status as a qualified thrift lender  within one year of its failure  we would be required to convert the bank to a commercial bank and to register as a bank holding company under the bank holding company act of  as amended 
change in bank control act

the home owners loan act provides that no company may acquire control of a savings association without the prior approval of the ots 
any company that acquires such control becomes a savings and loan holding company subject to registration  examination and regulation by the ots 
pursuant to federal regulations  control of a savings association which includes its holding company is conclusively deemed to have been acquired by  among other things  the acquisition of more than of any class of voting stock of the association or the ability to control the election of a majority of the directors of the association

the ots may prohibit an acquisition of control if it would result in a monopoly or substantially lessen competition  the financial condition or the acquiring person might jeopardize the financial stability of the association  or the competence  experience or integrity of the acquiring person indicates that it would not be in the interest of the depositors or the public to permit the acquisition of control by such person 

table of contents gramm leach bliley 
the gramm leach bliley act of  as amended  otherwise known as the financial services modernization act eliminated many federal and state law barriers to affiliations among banks  securities firms  insurance companies and other financial service providers 
the law revised and expanded the bank holding company act to permit a bank holding company to engage in a full range of financial activities by electing to be treated by the federal reserve board as a financial holding company 
financial activities is broadly defined to include not only banking  insurance and securities activities  but also merchant banking and additional activities that the federal reserve board  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determined to be financial in nature  incidental to such financial activities  or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
the financial services modernization act prohibits unitary savings and loan holding companies formed after may  from engaging in non financial activities 
we are a grandfathered unitary savings and loan holding company 
the financial services modernization act has not had a material adverse effect on our operations 
however  the financial services modernization act permits banks  securities firms and insurance companies to affiliate with one another 
this has continued a trend in the financial services industry toward further consolidation 
the financial services modernization act could result in an increasing amount of competition from larger institutions and other types of companies offering financial products  many of which may have substantially more financial resources 
in addition  the financial services modernization act may have an anti takeover effect because it may tend to limit our attractiveness as an acquisition candidate to other savings and loan holding companies and financial holding companies 
anti money laundering and usa patriot act 
a major focus of governmental policy on financial institutions in recent years has been aimed at combating money laundering and terrorist financing 
the usa patriot act of the usa patriot act substantially broadened the scope of united states anti money laundering laws and regulations by imposing significant new compliance and due diligence obligations  creating new crimes and penalties and expanding the extra territorial jurisdiction of the united states 
the united states treasury department has issued and  in some cases  proposed a number of regulations that apply various requirements of the usa patriot act to financial institutions such as united western bancorp and its subsidiaries 
these regulations impose obligations on financial institutions to maintain appropriate policies  procedures and controls to detect  prevent and report money laundering and terrorist financing and to verify the identity of their customers 
certain of those regulations impose specific due diligence requirements on financial institutions that maintain correspondent or private banking relationships with non us financial institutions or persons 
failure of a financial institution to maintain and implement adequate programs to combat money laundering and terrorist financing  or to comply with all of the relevant laws or regulations  could have serious legal and reputational consequences for the institution

united western bank s capital ratios 
federal law requires  among other things  that federal bank regulatory authorities take prompt corrective action with respect to savings institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements 
for these purposes  the law establishes five categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
the ots has adopted regulations to implement the prompt corrective action legislation 
an institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater and a leverage ratio of or greater  adequately capitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of or greater  a tier i risk based capital ratio of or greater and generally a leverage ratio of or greater  undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier i risk based capital ratio of less than  or generally a leverage ratio of less than  significantly undercapitalized if it has a total risk based capital ratio of less than  a tier i risk based capital ratio of less than  or a leverage ratio of less than  and critically undercapitalized if it has a ratio of tangible equity as defined in the regulations to total assets that is equal to or less than

generally  these transactions between the savings association and any one affiliate cannot exceed of the savings association s capital stock and surplus  and these transactions between the savings institution and all of its affiliates cannot  in the aggregate  exceed of the savings institution s capital stock and surplus 
section a also establishes specific collateral requirements for loans or extensions of credit to an affiliate  and for guarantees or acceptances on letters of credit issued on behalf of an affiliate 
applicable regulations prohibit a savings association from lending to any affiliate engaged in activities not permissible for a bank holding company or for the purpose of acquiring the securities of most affiliates 
section b requires that transactions covered by section a and a broad list of other specified transactions be on terms and under circumstances substantially the same  or no less favorable to the savings association or its subsidiary  as similar transactions with non affiliates 
in addition to the restrictions on transactions with affiliates that sections a and b of the federal reserve act impose on depository institutions  the regulations of the ots also generally prohibit a savings association from purchasing or investing in securities issued by an affiliate 
united western bank engages in transactions with its affiliates  which are structured with the intent of complying with these regulations 
insurance of accounts and regulation by the federal deposit insurance corporation 
the deposits of the bank are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the deposit insurance fund  which is administered by the fdic  and are backed by the full faith and credit of the u 
s 
government 
as insurer  the fdic is authorized to conduct examinations of  and to require reporting by  fdic insured institutions 
it also may prohibit any fdic insured institution from engaging in any activity the fdic determines by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the fdic 
the fdic also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against savings associations  after giving the ots an opportunity to take such action 

table of contents each fdic insured institution is assigned to one of three capital groups which are based solely on the level of an institution s capital well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized which are defined in the same manner as the regulations establishing the prompt corrective action system discussed above 
these three groups are then divided into three subgroups which reflect varying levels of supervisory concern  from those which are considered to be healthy to those which are considered to be of substantial supervisory concern 
the matrix so created results in nine assessment risk classifications  with rates during the first six months of ranging from zero for well capitalized  healthy institutions  to basis points for undercapitalized institutions with substantial supervisory concerns 
in addition  all institutions with deposits insured by the fdic are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation  a mixed ownership government corporation established to recapitalize the federal savings and loan insurance corporation fslic the predecessor to the savings association insurance fund 
the assessment rate for the third quarter of was 
of insured deposits and is adjusted quarterly 
these assessments will continue until the financing corporation bonds mature in the fdic may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution engaged or engaging in unsafe or unsound practices  is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations  or has violated any applicable law  regulation  order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the fdic 
it also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance  if the institution has no tangible capital 
if insurance of accounts is terminated  the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination  less subsequent withdrawals  shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years  as determined by the fdic 
management is not aware of any existing circumstances which could result in termination of the bank s deposit insurance 
deposit insurance reform 
on february   president george w 
bush signed into law legislation that merged the bank insurance fund and the savings association insurance fund to form the deposit insurance fund  which eliminated any disparities in bank and thrift risk based premium assessments  reduced the administrative burden of maintaining and operating two separate funds and established certain new insurance coverage limits and a mechanism for possible periodic increases 
the legislation also gave the fdic greater discretion to identify the relative risks all institutions present to the deposit insurance fund and set risk based premiums 
major provisions in the legislation include merging the savings association insurance fund and bank insurance fund  which became effective march   maintaining basic deposit and municipal account insurance coverage at  but providing for a new basic insurance coverage for retirement accounts of  insurance coverage for basic deposit and retirement accounts could be increased for inflation every five years in  increments beginning in  providing the fdic with the ability to set the designated reserve ratio within a range of between and  rather than maintaining at all times regardless of prevailing economic conditions  providing a one time assessment credit of billion to banks and savings associations in existence on december   which may be used to offset future premiums with certain limitations  and requiring the payment of dividends of of the amount the insurance fund exceeds of the estimated insured deposits and the payment of of the amount that the insurance fund exceeds of the estimated insured deposits when the reserve is greater than but no more than 
pursuant to the reform act  the fdic has determined to maintain the designated reserve ratio at its current  which will be reviewed annually 
the fdic has also adopted a new risk based premium system that provides for quarterly assessments based on an insured institution s ranking in one of four risk categories based upon supervisory and capital evaluations 
beginning in  well capitalized institutions generally those with camels composite ratings of or will be grouped in risk category i and will be assessed for deposit insurance at an annual rate of between five and seven basis points 
the assessment rate for an individual institution is determined according to a formula based on a weighted average of the institution s individual camels component ratings plus either five financial ratios or  in the case of an institution with assets of billion or more  the average ratings of its long term debt 
institutions in risk categories ii  iii and iv will be assessed at annual rates of  and basis points  respectively 
the bank anticipates that it will be able to partially offset its deposit insurance premium for with the special assessment credit

item a 
risk factors ownership of the common stock and other securities of the company involves certain risks 
holders of the company s securities and prospective investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included and incorporated by reference in this report  in evaluating an investment in the company s securities 
if any of the risks and uncertainties discussed below actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  other risks and uncertainties of which we are not currently aware  including those relating to the banking and financial services industries in general  or which we do not now believe are material  may cause earnings to be lower  or impair our future financial condition or results of operations 
the value or market price of our common stock could decline due to any of these identified or other risks  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to ownership of our common stock the trading volume of our stock is low and shareholders may not be able to resell shares at or above the price shareholders paid for them 
the trading in our common shares has less liquidity than many other companies quoted on the national securities exchanges or markets 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the market of willing buyers and sellers of our common shares at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
we cannot insure volume of trading in our common shares will increase in the future 
furthermore  to the extent shares are concentrated in a relatively small group of holders  a seller could be subject to significant adverse price volatility and price fluctuation 
at december   based on filings made by third parties with the securities and exchange commission  we believe that seven holders owned of our outstanding common stock 
this includes shares held by our chairman of the board  guy a 
gibson who owns  shares  or  of our outstanding common stock 
the issuance of additional shares may cause dilution 
our board of directors may authorize the issuance of additional common or preferred stock in connection with future equity offerings  acquisitions of securities or other assets of companies 
the board may also classify or reclassify any unissued preferred stock and set the preferences  rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares  including the issuance of shares of preferred stock that have preference rights over the common stock with respect to dividends  liquidation  voting and other matters 
the issuance of additional shares of our common stock could be dilutive to shareholders that do not invest in future offerings 
moreover  to the extent that we issue options  warrants or similar instruments to purchase our common stock in the future and those options  warrants or similar instruments are exercised or we issue restricted stock  shareholders may experience future dilution 

table of contents if our board issued additional shares for the purpose of an acquisition of another financial institution depending on the price paid and the price of our common stock  this could be dilutive to existing shareholders 
furthermore  there are significant implementation risks associated with the acquisition and integration of another entity into our company that could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations 
our board of directors may authorize the repurchase of common shares that may result in dilution 
in our board of directors authorized the repurchase by the company of approximately  shares of our common stock  of which we have already purchased  shares for aggregate consideration of million or per share 
the board of directors may authorize additional purchases in the future without shareholder approval 
if and to the extent that any future purchases are made at prices higher than the net tangible book value per share of the company  the value of the shares held by the remaining shareholders will be diluted 
control by our executive officers and directors will limit individual ability to influence the outcome of matters requiring shareholder approval and could discourage a potential acquisition by third parties 
as of march   our executive officers and directors beneficially owned approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
these shareholders  if acting together  would be able to influence significantly all matters requiring approval by our shareholders  including the election of our board of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
this concentration of ownership  among other factors  could delay or prevent a change in our control of the company or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer  which in turn could prevent our shareholders from realizing an acquisition premium over the market price for their shares of common stock 
we may not have the ability to pay dividends in the future 
on february   our board of directors declared a dividend of per share to record holders of our common stock on march  we had not paid any dividends on our equity before that dividend  which was paid on march  while no specific schedule of future dividends has yet been established  our board of directors intends to continue to declare dividends in the future if and to the extent warranted by our financial condition and cash availability 
the board s determination whether to pay future dividends will depend on a number of factors  including our future earnings  capital requirements  financial condition and future prospects and such other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant 
our ability to pay dividends is restricted by various provisions in our debt instruments  the most restrictive of which is a line of credit we have with another financial institution  which provides that the payment of dividends  as defined in such line of credit  is limited to of our net income 
additionally  we are prohibited from paying dividends on our common stock if the scheduled payments on our junior subordinated debentures and trust preferred securities have not been made 
the ability of united western bank and other subsidiaries to pay dividends to us may be restricted due to certain regulatory requirements 
risks related to our business strategy we may be unable to fully implement our community banking business strategy 
our executive management team has already begun to implement a traditional  community focused commercial banking strategy as discussed in item business strategy above 
in order to complete the execution of this strategy we must  among other things attract sufficient commercial business deposits  attract and maintain business banking relationships with businesses in the colorado front range market  attract and retain experienced and successful commercial and community bankers  identify and pursue suitable opportunities for opening new branches in the colorado front range market  maintain adequate regulatory capital and comply with applicable federal and state regulations  and originate community bank loans and maintain adequate asset quality 
failure to achieve these strategic goals could adversely affect our ability to fully implement our community banking business strategies as well as our overall financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to effectively manage our proposed growth 
our business strategy contemplates  in part  an increase in our franchise value by expanding into additional communities in the colorado front range through a branch network for united western bank 
to the extent that we undertake additional branch openings  we are likely to experience the effects of higher operating expenses relative to operating income from the new operations for a period of time 
while we are confident in our ability to execute our community banking strategy  it is possible that our expansion could significantly burden our infrastructure or that we will be unable to effectively manage the development of our planned growth 

table of contents our ability to attract and retain management and key personnel may adversely affect future growth and earnings 
our ability to successfully execute our business strategy requires us to attract and to retain management experienced in community banking and financial services and familiar with the communities in our market areas 
our ability to retain our executive officers  regional presidents  other management and lending professionals will continue to be important to the successful implementation of our strategy 
as we grow  it is also important to attract and retain additional qualified lending professionals with the appropriate level of experience and knowledge about our market areas to implement our community based operating strategy 
the unexpected loss of services of key personnel  or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future  could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in economic conditions in the colorado front range market could have a material adverse effect on the implementation and success of our business strategy 
the implementation and success of our business strategy depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the colorado front range market 
the local economic conditions in our market area will have a significant impact on residential and commercial loans originated  the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans 
moreover  a significant decline in general economic condition caused by inflation  recession  unemployment or other factors beyond our control would affect these local economic conditions in our market area and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our past operating results and financial condition will likely not be representative of our future results and financial condition 
since december of  we have sold our interest in various subsidiaries  established new bank branches  sold and leased back our headquarters building  and discontinued certain operations 
in addition  we are continuing to implement our plan to expand the retail operations of united western bank  through the opening of new branches and increasing its direct originations of residential and commercial loans 
these changes in our operations and new business strategies will make period to period comparisons difficult and our past operating results and financial condition will likely not be indicative of our future results and financial condition 
we may elect to divest other non core businesses  which could have an adverse effect on our results 
we successfully divested several non core businesses in while we currently have no specific intent to do so  management could seek to dispose of other subsidiaries in the future 
if we do elect to divest any of our remaining non core subsidiaries  the effect of such disposition could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
risks related to our business united western bank relies on institutional deposits 
a significant portion of united western bank s total deposits are funds deposited as a result of unaffiliated institutional relationships maintained by united western bank 
at december   five unrelated institutional relationships accounted for million of our total deposits including custodial escrow deposits 
sterling  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  accounted for million of our total deposits 
mg colorado holdings  inc  a company in which we own an approximate interest  accounted for million of our deposits and legent clearing  a company in which our chairman owns a minority interest  accounted for million of our deposits 
institutional depositors generally are more sensitive to interest rate levels due to the amount of money they maintain on deposit than retail consumers who bank at a branch office 
united western bank s future success in retaining and attracting institutional depositors depends  in part  on united western bank s ability to offer competitive rates and services 
if united western bank loses one or more of these institutional relationships  its liquidity  profitability and results of operations may be significantly and adversely affected 
see the additional discussion of deposits in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
united western bank relies on wholesale funding sources for secondary and contingent liquidity sources 
united western bank utilizes borrowings from the fhlbank system  brokered certificates of deposits and repurchase agreements for secondary and contingent sources of liquidity 
also  from time to time  the bank utilizes these sources to capitalize on market opportunities to fund investment and loan initiatives 
if united western bank were unable to obtain or maintain our access to funding or if adequate funding is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates  it would have to find alternative sources of liquidity  which  if available  would probably be at a higher cost and on terms that do not match the structure of our liabilities as well as the existing wholesale funding sources 
see further discussion of our fhlbank system borrowings at item balance sheet short term borrowings and balance sheet liquidity and in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this report 

table of contents we must effectively manage our credit risk 
there are risks inherent in making any loan  including risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers  risks of nonpayment  risks resulting from uncertainties as to the future value of collateral and risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions 
united western bank attempts to minimize its credit risk by undertaking the use of prudent loan application approval procedures  an analysis of the credit risk  the value of the underlying collateral  careful monitoring of the concentration of its loans within specific industries and geographic locations and periodic independent reviews of outstanding loans by its loan review and audit departments 
nevertheless  we are exposed to risks including possible errors in united western bank s credit analysis  the uncertainty of the borrower s ability to repay the loans  the uncertainty of future economic conditions and the possibility of loan defaults 
see further discussion of the bank s nonperforming loans at item balance sheet asset quality and balance sheet allowance for credit losses in this report 
our business is subject to interest rate risk  and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance 
changes in the interest rate environment may reduce our profits 
a substantial portion of our income is derived from the differential  or spread  between the interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
because of the differences in the maturities and repricing characteristics of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
in rising interest rate environments  loan repayment rates will decline  and in falling interest rate environments  loan repayment rates will increase 
in addition  an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of some borrowers to pay the interest and principal of their obligations 
changes in interest rates also significantly impact the valuation of our mortgage servicing rights and loans held for sale 
both of these assets are carried at the lower of cost or market 
as interest rates decline and mortgage loans prepay faster  mortgage servicing rights decline in value 
changes in mortgage prepayments  interest rates and other factors can cause the value of this asset to decrease rapidly over a short period of time 
changes in interest rates  prepayment speeds and other factors may also cause the value of our loans held for sale to change  possibly resulting in a charge to earnings 
when interest rates rise  the cost of borrowing increases 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect the carrying value of our mortgage servicing rights  our held for sale loan portfolios  our net interest spread  asset quality and loan origination volume 
see further discussion at item a 
asset liability management and interest rate risk in this report 
although we believe our current level of interest rate risk sensitivity is reasonable and effectively managed  significant fluctuations in interest rates may have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have invested in loan portfolios  pooled securities and mortgage backed obligations  which may lead to volatility in cash flow and market risk 
our asset portfolio contains large portfolios of single family residential loans acquired through bulk purchases  purchased sba loans and pools 
our investment portfolio largely consists of mortgage backed securities primarily secured by pools of mortgages on single family residences 
when we acquire such mortgage backed securities and loans  we anticipate that the underlying notes will prepay at a projected rate  thereby generating an expected yield 
prepayment rates generally increase as interest rates fall and decrease when interest rates rise  but changes in prepayment rates are difficult to predict 
some of our mortgage backed securities  and many of our bulk single family loan purchases and purchased sba loans and pools were acquired at a premium purchase price 
in accordance with applicable accounting rules  we will write off such premiums when necessary due to loan prepayments with respect to our held for sale loan portfolio and amortize such premiums over the expected lives of our mortgage backed securities and loans held for investment 
if the underlying assets we acquired or that secures our mortgage backed securities prepays more rapidly than anticipated  we would have to write off or amortize the premium on an accelerated basis  which would adversely affect our profitability 
the carrying value of our residential mortgage loan servicing rights and our loan servicing income derived from residential mortgage loan servicing rights may be adversely affected during periods of declining interest rates 
owning residential mortgage loan servicing rights carries interest rate risk because its value and the total amount of servicing fees earned  as well as the amortization of the investment in the servicing rights  fluctuates based on interest rates and loan prepayments affecting the expected average life of a portfolio of residential mortgage servicing rights 
the rate of prepayment of mortgage loans may be influenced by changing national and regional economic trends  such as recessions or depressed real estate markets  as well as the difference between interest rates on existing mortgage loans relative to prevailing mortgage rates 
during periods of declining interest rates  many borrowers refinance their mortgage loans 
accordingly  as prepayments of mortgage loans increase  the loan administration fee income related to the residential mortgage loan servicing rights corresponding to a mortgage loan ceases as mortgage loans are prepaid 
consequently  the market value of portfolios of residential mortgage loan servicing rights tends to decrease during periods of declining interest rates  since greater prepayments can be expected  and as a result  the amount of loan administration income received also decreases 
see further discussion at item mortgage servicing rights  and at item a 
interest rate risk in this report 

table of contents we may have fluctuations in our quarterly results 
our financial results are subject to significant quarterly fluctuations as a result of  among other things  our loan production  opening of new branch locations  development of new products and services  premium amortization caused by prepayments of certain wholesale assets  such as our single family mortgage loans  guaranteed sba loans and pooled securities and changes in interest rates 
our operating results will fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors  some of which are outside of our control  including general economic conditions  economic conditions in the financial industry  the effects of governmental regulations and regulatory changes  capital expenditures and other costs relating to the expansion of operations  the introduction of new services by us or our competitors and the mix of services sold 
in response to a changing competitive environment  we may elect from time to time to make certain pricing  service  or marketing decisions or enter into strategic alliances or make investments that could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flow 
accordingly  our results of operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for any succeeding quarter or for the full fiscal year 
our loan portfolio remains concentrated in real estate loans 
real estate lending including commercial  construction  land development  and residential remains a large portion of our loan portfolio 
these categories constitute million  or approximately of our total loan portfolio as of december  our business plan calls for continued increases of commercial real estate  residential and commercial construction and land development loans 
a downturn in the real estate markets in which united western bank originates  purchases and services mortgage and other loans could hurt its business because these loans are secured by real estate 
united western bank s real property collateral is currently located throughout the united states although  as a result of our community banking strategy  the amount of such collateral in the colorado front range market is likely to increase 
real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by changes in national  regional or local economic conditions  fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers  changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes  regulations and policies and acts of nature 
if real estate prices decline  the value of real estate collateral securing the loans could be reduced 
united western bank s ability to recover on defaulted loans by foreclosing and selling the real estate collateral would then be diminished and united western bank would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans 
any such downturn in the real estate markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face strong competition from financial service companies and other companies that offer banking services  which could hurt our business 
pursuant to our community banking business strategy  we expect to expand our retail and commercial banking operations in the colorado front range market 
increased competition within this market may result in reduced loans and deposits 
ultimately  we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
many competitors offer the financial and banking services that we offer  or intend to offer  in the colorado front range market 
many of these competitors have larger balance sheets than ours and may be able to compete more effectively than us due to their relative size 
if we are unable to attract and retain banking customers  we may be unable to achieve our anticipated loan and deposit growth and our business  financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected 
see further discussion of competition at item competition in this report 
the allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses and must be managed to provide sufficient reserves to absorb probable losses in our loan portfolio 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that losses could be sustained because borrowers  guarantors and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans 
the underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that the company has adopted to address this risk may not prevent unexpected losses that could harm our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
unexpected losses may arise from a wide variety of specific or systemic factors  many of which are beyond the company s ability to predict  influence or control 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and nonperformance 
the company s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses  and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the allowance for loan losses reflects the company s estimate of the probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio at the relevant balance sheet date 
the company s allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience  as well as an evaluation of the known risks in the current portfolio  composition and growth of the loan portfolio and economic factors 
the determination of an appropriate level of loan loss allowance is an inherently difficult process and is based on numerous assumptions 
the amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates that may be beyond the company s control  and these losses may exceed current estimates 
we cannot assure you that the company will not increase its allowance for loan losses further or that regulators will not require united western bank to increase its allowance 
either of these occurrences could harm our results of operations

table of contents the mortgage loans that we hold are subject to risks of delinquency  foreclosure and loss  which could result in losses to us 
the residential and commercial mortgage loans held in our loan portfolio are secured by residential and commercial properties and are subject to risks of delinquency  foreclosure and loss of principal and interest 
the ability of a borrower to repay a loan secured by residential property typically is dependent primarily upon the income or assets of the borrower 
in addition  other factors that affect the risk of our mortgage loan portfolio include property location and condition  competition and demand for comparable properties  changes in zoning laws for the property or its surrounding area  environmental contamination at the property  the occurrence of any uninsured casualty at the property  changes in national  regional or local economic conditions  declines in regional or local real estate values  increases in interest rates and or real estate tax rates  changes in governmental rules  regulations and fiscal policies  including environmental legislation and tax laws  and other events such as acts of god  natural disasters  war  terrorism  social unrest and civil disturbances 
in the event of any default under a mortgage loan held in our mortgage loan portfolio  we will bear a risk of loss of principal to the extent of any deficiency between the value of the collateral that we can realize upon foreclosure and sale and the principal and accrued interest of the mortgage loan and the cost of foreclosing on the related property 
losses resulting from mortgage loan defaults and foreclosures could have a material adverse effect on our income and cash flow from operations 
in the event of the bankruptcy of a mortgage loan borrower  the mortgage loan to such borrower will be deemed to be secured only to the extent of the value of the underlying collateral at the time of bankruptcy  as determined by the bankruptcy court 
the lien securing the mortgage loan will be subject to the avoidance powers of the bankruptcy trustee or debtor in possession to the extent the lien is unenforceable under state law 
foreclosure of a mortgage loan can be an expensive and lengthy process that can have a substantial negative effect on our originally anticipated return on the foreclosed mortgage loan 
we are exposed to risk of environmental liabilities with respect to properties to which we take title 
in the course of our business we may foreclose and take title to real estate and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or we may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site  we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if we become subject to significant environmental liabilities  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
if we sell mortgage loans or mortgage servicing rights and the underlying loan defaults  we may be liable to the purchaser for unpaid principal and interest on the loan 
in the ordinary course of selling mortgage loans or mortgage servicing rights and in accordance with industry standards  we make certain representations and warranties to purchasers 
if a loan defaults and there has been a breach of representations or warranties and we have no recourse against a third party  we may become liable for the unpaid principal and interest on the defaulted loan 
in such a case  we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss on the loan 
when we purchase mortgage servicing rights or mortgage loans  we also are exposed to liability to the extent that an originator or other seller of the servicing rights is unable to honor its representations and warranties to us 
the company has established a reserve for repurchases that may be required in connection with loans we originated and sold in connection with the sale of our wholesale production platform in 
table of contents if a loan originator or seller of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights breaches its representations and warranties to us  we may be at risk if such seller does not have the financial capacity to pay for damages we incur as a result of such breach or to repurchase any such loan 
we generally receive representations and warranties from the originators and sellers from whom we purchase mortgage loans and mortgage servicing rights  as well as in certain situations  contractually providing for recourse relating to performance of the loans we purchase 
however  in the event of an originator s and or seller s breach of such representations and warranties  we may be subject to the risk of loss that may result from such a breach if the seller and or originator does not have the financial capacity to pay for any damages we incur or to repurchase loans when called upon by us to do so 
curtailment of government guaranteed loan programs could affect our sba business 
our sba business relies on originating  purchasing  pooling and selling government guaranteed loans  in particular those guaranteed by the sba 
from time to time  the government agencies that guarantee these loans reach their internal limits and cease to guarantee loans for a period of time 
in addition  these agencies may change their rules for loans or the us congress may adopt legislation that would have the effect of discontinuing or changing the programs 
if changes occur  the volumes of loans that qualify for government guarantees could decline 
lower volumes of origination of government guaranteed loans may reduce the profitability of our sba business 
failure in our automated systems and controls could subject us to increased operating costs as well as litigation and other liabilities 
we depend heavily upon our automated systems and controls for our business and operations 
these systems and controls support the evaluation  acquisition  monitoring  collection and administration of our loan and servicing portfolios  depository  general accounting and other management functions  as well as the brokerage functions we perform 
the failure of the automated systems  including a failure of data integrity or accuracy  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
the computer systems and network infrastructure we use could be vulnerable to unforeseen problems 
our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our computer equipment against damage from fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or a similar catastrophic event 
any damage or failure that causes an interruption in our operations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect the computer systems and network infrastructure utilized by us against damage from physical break ins  security breaches and other disruptive problems caused by the internet or other users 
such computer break ins and other disruptions would jeopardize the security of information stored in and transmitted through our computer systems and network infrastructure  which may result in significant liability to us and deter potential customers 
although we  with the help of third party service providers  intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent such damage  there can be no assurance that these security measures will be successful 
a failure of such security measures could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any failure to prevent breaches of our computer and network security systems may result in customer information being compromised and or identity theft  which would have a material adverse effect upon our business 
we maintain personal and financial information about our current  past and potential customers on our computer systems and network infrastructure  such as customer names  addresses  social security numbers  tax identification numbers  bank account numbers  information on loan applications and other sensitive personal and financial information about our customers 
in addition  our customers may use the internet to connect to united western bank s website to retrieve information about their accounts and to conduct online transactions  such as online bill payments 
if the security of our encrypted computer systems and network infrastructure responsible for storing our customers personal and financial data and information or the security of our online banking internet services is breached  then customer information could be stolen and misused 
such misuse could include the loss of privacy resulting from the sale or disclosure of the information to third parties  credit fraud or other consequences of identity theft to the customer 
while we believe that our current encrypted systems meet or exceed all commercial standards for network security  new criminal schemes or capabilities could compromise or breach our systems and network infrastructure 
if our security measures fail to protect our customer s information  our existing and future customer base may be adversely affected  we may become subject to customer lawsuits  the public perception of us may be diminished  and our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected

item legal proceedings general 
we are from time to time party to various litigation matters  in most cases involving ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business 
we accrue for contingent liabilities with respect to litigation matters in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which generally requires the company to accrue a loss for a litigation matter involving a contingent liability if the loss is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
in order to determine whether the two conditions necessary for accrual are met  management necessarily makes a number of judgments and assumptions 
because the outcome of most litigation matters is inherently uncertain  the company will generally only accrue a loss for a pending litigation matter if  for example  the parties to the matter have entered into definitive settlement agreements or a final judgment adverse to the company has been entered 
in many cases  these settlements or final judgments are not material to the consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows of the company 
nevertheless  an adverse decision in certain matters  as described below  may have a material  adverse impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows

fourth quarter results net income for the fourth quarter of was million or 
per diluted share compared to net income of million for the third quarter or 
per diluted share 
the company reported a loss of million or 
per diluted share in the fourth quarter of on a linked quarter basis  net income increased million 
the increase in income was due to several factors the largest of which was the gain from the exercise of our put option on our retained interest in matrix asset management  llc mam 
we realized a pre tax gain of million on this sale  million after tax  or 
per diluted share 
continued planned growth in our community bank loan portfolio and securities portfolio  combined with the retirement of a portion of our long term debt and a change in the composition of other interest bearing liabilities  contributed to a million increase in net interest income before provision for credit losses  or  between the third and fourth quarters 
net interest income before provision for credit losses totaled million for the quarter ended december   compared to million for the quarter ended september  our net interest margin was for the fourth quarter of compared to for the third quarter of this basis point increase in net interest margin between the third and fourth quarters of was due to the increase in outstanding community bank loans of million since the community bank loans have higher yields than our wholesale assets  which are running off and being replaced 
on a year to year basis  the basis point increase in net interest margin from for the quarter ended december  to for this year is due to the same factors described above as well as the increased volume of interest earning assets 
the provision for credit losses was  for the quarter ended december   compared to  for the quarter ended december  the decrease in provision in the fourth quarter was due to the resolution of non performing loans and resultant improvement in asset quality that occurred in the period 
noninterest income was million for the quarter ended december   compared to million for the quarter ended december  and million for the quarter ended september  the increase in the year over year period was due principally to the gain from the sale of our interest in mam  discussed above  which was partially offset by continued declining loan administration income that is associated with our reducing mortgage servicing portfolio 
noninterest income is relatively unchanged from the third quarter  as in that period we monetized million of new market tax credits upon which we earned a fee of approximately million 
in the third quarter of  we also realized approximately  as gain on sale of property 
noninterest expense was million for the quarter ended december   compared to million for the quarter ended december   and million for the quarter ended september  between the fourth quarters and  the principal factors contributing to the million decrease were the settlement of litigation at sterling in the amount of million in  a million charge to write down our held for sale single family residential loan portfolio to the lower of cost or market locom in and lower compensation costs associated with the establishment of community banking identity discussed above this year 
in comparing the fourth quarter and the third quarter  the principal factors that contributed to the  decrease in noninterest expenses were a  decline in mortgage servicing rights amortization due to the absolute decline in the mortgage servicing rights  and a  decline in occupancy expense due to sale of our tower  which reduced certain landlord expenses  as well as approximately  of amortization of our deferred gain from the sale of our headquarters building in offsetting most of these declines was an increase of  in compensation caused by increased community bank loan production  new banking professionals hired in the period  and year end incentive compensation 

table of contents income tax expense was million for the quarter ended december   compared to a benefit of million for the quarter ended december  and  for the quarter ended september  our tax rate was  and for those same periods respectively

risk factors  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item in this report 
overview for the year ended december   earnings were million compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
diluted earnings per share for increased to compared to 
per share in income from continuing operations was million for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  diluted earnings per share from continuing operations for was compared to 
per share in the primary source of the company s net revenue is net interest income after provision for credit losses  which is the difference between total interest earned on interest earning assets and total interest incurred on interest bearing liabilities less provision for credit losses 
our net income is also significantly affected by other income and other expenses 
the provision for loan losses reflects the amount added to the allowance for loan losses that we believe is needed to ensure the allowance is adequate to cover probable inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
non interest income or other income consists of loan administration fees  custodial and administrative service fees  net gains on sale of assets  net gains on sale of loans and securities  brokerage fees  litigation settlements  and other operating income 
other expenses includes compensation and employee benefits  subaccounting fees  amortization of mortgage servicing rights  occupancy and equipment  mortgage servicing rights  subservicing fees  professional fees  data processing  and other operating expenses 
net interest income can change significantly from period to period based on levels of interest rates  customer prepayment patterns  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and the volume and mix of interest bearing liabilities 
the provision for credit losses is dependent on changes in the loan portfolio and management s assessment of the collectibility of the loan portfolio  as well as economic and market conditions 
other income and other expenses are impacted by growth of operations and growth in the number of accounts through the execution of our community banking business strategy 
growth in operations affects other expenses as a result of additional employees and increases in our regional banking office locations 
growth in the number of accounts affects other income  including certain fees as well as other expenses such as data processing  supplies  postage  telecommunications and other miscellaneous expenses 
critical accounting policies the company and its subsidiaries have established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation and presentation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies of the company are described in note of the consolidated financial statements  and along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments  assumptions and estimates by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  which management considers to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments  assumptions and estimates used by management are based on historical experience  knowledge of the accounts and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates  which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 

table of contents allowance for credit losses 
the company currently views the determination of the allowance for credit losses as a critical accounting policy that requires significant judgments  assumptions and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for credit losses is management s estimate of probable credit losses that are inherent in the loan portfolios 
management takes into consideration factors such as the fair value of the underlying collateral and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  the collective experience of our credit risk management team and consideration of current economic trends and conditions 
the allowance for credit losses consists of four components  pools of homogeneous single family loans with similar risk characteristics  pools of homogenous community bank loans with similar risk characteristics ie  multifamily  residential and commercial construction and development  commercial real estate and commercial  individually significant loans that are measured for impairment and a component representing an estimate of inherent  but probable undetected losses  which also contemplates the imprecision in the credit risk models utilized to calculate the allowance 
pools of homogeneous single family loans with similar risk characteristics are assessed for probable losses based on loss migration analysis where loss factors are updated regularly based on actual experience 
the analysis examines historical loss experience and the related internal gradings of loans charged off 
the loss migration analysis also considers inherent but undetected losses within the portfolio 
pools of homogeneous community bank loans with similar risk characteristics ie multifamily  residential and commercial construction and development  commercial real estate and commercial are assessed for probable losses based on loss migration analysis where loss factors are updated regularly based on our own loss experience  the collective experience of our credit risk management team  loss rates at selected peer community banks and industry data 
the analysis also incorporates the related internal gradings of loans charged off and other factors including our asset quality trends and national and local economic conditions 
the portion of the allowance established for loans measured for impairment reflects expected losses resulting from analyses developed through specific allocations for individual loans 
the company considers a loan impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan 
estimated fair value is typically measured using the fair value of collateral  as such loans are usually collateral dependent  but may be measured using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted using loan rate  or the market price of the loan 
all loans considered impaired are included in nonperforming loans 
the company evaluates its residential loans collectively due to their homogeneous nature 
accordingly  potential impaired loans of the company include only community bank loans such as multifamily  residential and commercial construction and development  commercial real estate and commercial loans classified as nonperforming loans 
the last component of the allowance for credit losses is a portion which represents the estimated inherent but undetected probable losses  and the imprecision in the credit risk models utilized to calculate the allowance 
this component of the allowance is primarily associated with community bank loans and is reflective of the uncertainty related to the recent growth in the community bank loan portfolio  general economic conditions and ongoing uncertainty with respect to a small number of individually large loans 
loan losses are charged against the allowance when the loan is considered uncollectible 
in the opinion of management  the allowance is adequate to absorb the inherent losses in the current loan portfolio 
there are many factors affecting the allowance for loan losses  some are quantitative while others require qualitative judgment 
although management believes its process for determining the allowance adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in credit losses  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for credit losses could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 

table of contents litigation 
the company also considers the judgments and assumptions concerning litigation as a critical accounting policy 
from time to time the company is named as a defendant in various legal proceedings 
most of these cases involve ordinary and routine claims incidental to our business 
we accrue for contingent liabilities with respect to litigation matters in accordance with the requirements of sfas  which generally requires the company to accrue a loss for a litigation matter involving a contingent liability if the loss is probable and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
see a full description of such proceedings at item legal proceedings 
with respect to all pending litigation matters  our ultimate legal responsibility  if any  cannot be estimated with certainty 
based on the ultimate outcome of such proceedings  it is possible that future results of operations and financial position for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to such proceedings 
valuation of mortgage servicing rights and loans held for sale 
the company also considers its locom valuations which apply to the valuation of mortgage servicing rights and loans held for sale to be a critical accounting policy that requires use of judgments  assumptions and estimates 
our mortgage servicing portfolio does not trade in an active open market with readily observable market prices 
although sales of mortgage servicing rights do occur  the exact terms and conditions may not be readily available 
as such  mortgage servicing rights are established and valued in accordance with sfas using discounted cash flow modeling techniques that require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows  taking into consideration actual and expected mortgage loan prepayment rates  discount rates  servicing costs  and other economic factors 
the expected and actual rates of mortgage loan prepayments are the most significant factors driving the value of mortgage servicing rights asset 
increases in mortgage loan prepayments reduce estimated future net servicing cash flows because the life of the underlying loan is reduced 
in determining the fair value of the mortgage servicing rights  mortgage interest rates  which are used to determine prepayment rates  and discount rates are held constant over the estimated life of the portfolio 
expected mortgage loan prepayment rates are derived from a third party model and may be adjusted to reflect the specific characteristics of the company s portfolio 
mortgage servicing rights are carried at the lower of the initial capitalized amount  net of accumulated amortization  or fair value 
management compares its fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and believes that the fair values and related assumptions are comparable to those used by other market participants 
the company has recorded impairment reserves and recoveries of such reserves based on the market conditions and the valuation analysis 
although management believes its process for determining the impairment reserve required adequately considers all of the potential factors that could potentially result in declines in value of the mortgage servicing rights  the process includes subjective elements and may be susceptible to significant change 
to the extent actual outcomes differ from management estimates  additional provision for impairment could be required that could adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
the company classified million of loan assets as held for sale at december  the majority of these loans consist of single family residential loans and multifamily loans of approximately million and million  respectively 
loans held for sale are required to be carried at the lower of cost or market in accordance with sfas  accounting for certain mortgage banking activities 
many of the loans owned by the company either do not trade in an active market or trade in inefficient markets 
as such  the market value of loans without available market prices is estimated by loan type using interest rates for reasonably comparable assets found in the secondary marketplace 
other factors including delinquency  existence of government guarantees  and other economic factors are considered in estimating the fair value of loans held for sale 
management compares its fair value estimates and assumptions to observable market data where available and to recent market activity and believes the fair values and related assumptions are comparable to those used by other market participants 
a rising interest rate environment may possibly result in declines in the market value of the loans held for sale  which may adversely affect earnings or financial position in future periods 
the company mitigates risk associated with declines in the estimated fair value of its loans held for sale by predominately holding loans with variable interest rates that tend to be less market sensitive to interest rate fluctuations than long term fixed rate loans 
any material effect on the consolidated financial statements related to these critical accounting areas is also discussed in this financial review 
recent accounting pronouncements note to the consolidated financial statements discusses new accounting policies adopted by the company during and the expected impact of accounting policies recently issued or proposed but not yet required to be adopted 
to the extent the adoption of new accounting standards materially affects financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity  the impacts thereof are discussed in the applicable section s of this discussion and the notes to the consolidated financial statements

these community bank loans comprise million  or of our average interest earning assets portfolio for these loans yielded  while all other interest earning assets yield

provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses is determined by management as the amount to be added to the allowance for credit losses after net charge offs have been deducted to bring the allowance to a level that is management s best estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolios 
the provision for credit losses totaled million in compared to million in and million in see the section captioned allowance for credit losses elsewhere in this discussion for further analysis of the provision for credit losses

brokerage fees principally represent income earned from sba trading fees and to a lesser extent fees earned from investment company shares and commissions earned from brokering fixed income securities 
brokerage fees decreased by million  or  to  for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was principally the result of our decision to temporarily suspend the trading activities at first matrix between march and november in december  we reentered this business line  however  currently the interest rate yield curve and the price that other participants are willing to pay to acquire newly originated loans has limited our ability to purchase a significant amount of loans at levels that we deem prudent 
in  brokerage fees had already decreased million  or  to million as compared to million in this decrease was principally due to sba trading fees  which were approximately million in as compared to million in the decrease in these fees were due to changes in the marketplace caused by the entry of other participants into this business line which increased the cost to acquire the assets on which such sba trading fees are earned as well as the affect of the yield curve which impacted the prices at which such assets could be resold

the company is required to record its investment in mortgage servicing rights at the lower of cost or fair value 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined based on the discounted future servicing income stratified based on one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
the company stratifies its mortgage servicing rights by product type and investor  among other things  to reflect the predominant risks 
to determine the fair value of its investment  the company uses a valuation model that calculates the present value of future cash flows 
due to changes in the interest rate environment during the periods  among other factors  an impairment recovery against the valuation of the asset was recorded

overall loans declined by million  or  due to repayments of million of single family loans and a decline of million of guaranteed sba loans

loans are placed on nonaccrual when full payment of principal or interest is in doubt or when they are past due days as to either principal or interest 
during the ordinary course of business  management may become aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of loan agreements 
these loans are placed under close supervision with consideration given to placing the loan on non accrual status  increasing the allowance for credit losses and if appropriate partial or full charge off 
non accrual loans are further classified as impaired when underlying collateral is not sufficient to cover the loan balance and it is probable that we will not fully collect all principal and interest 
after a loan is placed on non accrual status  any interest previously accrued but not yet collected is reversed against current income 
if interest payments are received on non accrual loans  these payments will be applied to principal and not taken into income 
loans will not be placed back on accrual status unless back interest and principal payments are made 
for certain government sponsored loans such as fha insured and va guaranteed loans  we continue to accrue interest when the loan is past due or more days  as the majority of the interest on these loans is insured by the federal government

table of contents total nonperforming loans decreased by million  or  to million at december  from million at december  this decrease was based on the efforts of our new credit professionals

allowance for credit losses 
management believes the allowance for credit losses is critical to the understanding of our financial condition and results of operations 
selection and application of this critical accounting policy involves judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to occur  and depending upon the severity of such changes  materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable possibility 
we maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level that management believes is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in the existing loan portfolio based on an evaluation of the collectibility of loans  underlying collateral  geographic and other concentrations  and prior loss experience 
we use a risk rating system to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
with this system  each loan  with the exception of those included in large groups of smaller balance homogeneous loans  is risk rated between one and ten  by the originating loan officer  credit administration  loan review or loan committee  with one being the best case and ten being a loss or the worst case 
estimated loan default factors are multiplied against loan balances and then multiplied by an historical loss given default rate by loan type to determine an appropriate level for the allowance for loan losses 
a specific reserve may be needed on a loan by loan basis 
loans with risk ratings between six and nine are monitored more closely by the officers and credit administration  and asset quality committee  and may result in specific reserves 
the allowance for credit losses also includes an element for estimated probable but undetected losses and for imprecision in the loan loss models discussed above 
for  with the implementation of our new business plan and the hiring of our new credit professionals  our methodology was enhanced and refined 
we implemented the ten point risk rating system  we reviewed the entire loan portfolio and revised the loss factors that we apply to many loan types based on the experience of our credit professionals and the company s relative lack of experience with certain loan types in the portfolio 
the following table sets forth information regarding changes in our allowance for credit losses for the periods indicated

see additional discussion in note discontinued operations sale of abs school services  llc to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
the provision for credit losses charged to operations for through includes abs school services  llc  provision reported in income from discontinued operations line item on the consolidated statements of income 
the provision for credit losses was million for the year ended december  compared to million for and million for the provision is based on the results of our quarterly analyses of the loan portfolio and change in the mix of the loan portfolio 
for the provision for credit losses was approximately  in the first quarter of as management implemented new loss factors based on its experience and considering the risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
in the second quarter the provision for credit losses was approximately million due to certain weakened credits and to accommodate our proactive approach to resolving certain specific credits 
in the second half of  management worked to reduce the nonperforming assets resulting in the asset quality improvement discussed above 
further  continued repayments from the single family portfolio and improvement in asset quality freed up reserves such that significantly lower levels of provision for credit losses were necessary in the second half of the year

table of contents the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total loans was at december   at december   at december   at december  and at december  the allowance for credit losses is reduced by loans charged off  net of recoveries 
the balance of the allowance for credit losses allocated to residential mortgage loans has decreased in absolute terms primarily due to a decrease in the balance of these loans in nonaccrual status as well as a decrease in the principal balance of these loans 
the allowance for credit losses for residential loans was  and at december   and  respectively 
the reserve in prior years was impacted by the production activities at matrix financial 
the increase in the allowance for as compared to is due to isolated portfolios of residential loans  which total approximately million that management has identified as having greater than average credit risk exposure 
the decrease from to in the residential allowance was due to resolution of certain loans that remained from the production activities at matrix financial 
the allowance for credit losses for commercial real estate  commercial  construction and development and consumer loans was   and at december   and  respectively 
the allowance declined basis points in as compared to commensurate with the improvement in asset quality that occurred 
the allowance levels in and were reflective of the greater level of nonperforming assets and greater level of impairments associated with certain nonperforming assets 
the unallocated portion of the allowance for credit losses increased by  to  at december   compared to  at december  while we consider the unallocated portion of the allowance to be primarily associated with commercial real estate loans  the allowance is available for losses of any loan type 
the increase in the unallocated portion of the allowance compared to the prior years is associated with inherited portions of the community bank portfolio 
certain of the multifamily and commercial real estate loans are located outside of the colorado front range so that the borrowers are not well known to management or our senior lenders 
in addition  most of these loans were underwritten with requirements of only annual financial statements and annual tax information 
as such  deterioration may occur that is unknown to management until the borrower becomes delinquent with their loan 
accordingly  management believed a modest increase in the unallocated portion of the reserve was required for certain multifamily and commercial real estate loans 
as of december   we believe that the allowance  when taken as a whole  is adequate to absorb estimated probable current losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
however  no assurances can be made that further provisions and reserves will not be necessary

we anticipate continuing declines of these balances prospectively 

table of contents the following table shows the delinquency statistics for the mortgage loans serviced through matrix financial  excluding loans subserviced for others  as of the dates presented 
delinquencies and foreclosures for the mortgage loans serviced by us generally exceed the national average due to high rates of delinquencies and foreclosures on certain bulk loan and bulk servicing portfolios

table of contents a significant risk of owning mortgage servicing rights is that the underlying loans prepay at a rate faster than predicted at acquisition 
during periods of declining interest rates  prepayments of mortgage loans usually increase as homeowners seek to refinance at lower interest rates  resulting in a decrease in the value of the servicing portfolio 
mortgage loans with higher interest rates and or higher principal balances are more likely to result in prepayments because the cost savings to the borrower from refinancing can be significant 
due to the prevalent low interest rate environment that existed  primarily in and  the actual prepayment activity experienced was greater than initially modeled when the servicing was either acquired or capitalized 
based on the high prepayment activity experienced  the servicing investment has not been profitable in the periods presented 
the following table shows the annualized prepayment rate for each quarter and the annual average prepayment rate experience on the mortgage loans serviced by matrix financial  excluding loans subserviced by and for others for the years ended december  quarter ended december september june march annual average sales of servicing rights 
historically  we have sold mortgage servicing portfolios 
in the ordinary course of selling mortgage servicing rights  consistent with industry standards  we make certain representations and warranties to purchasers of mortgage servicing rights 
if a borrower defaults and there has been a breach of representations or warranties and we have no third party recourse  we may become liable for the unpaid principal and interest on defaulted loans 
in such a case  we may be required to repurchase the mortgage loan and bear any subsequent loss on the loan 
historically  we have not incurred material losses related to the sale of the servicing portfolio due to breaches of representations and warranties and we do not anticipate any future material losses due to breaches of representations and warranties  however  there can be no assurance that we will not experience such losses 
valuation of servicing rights 
our servicing portfolio is valued at least quarterly in accordance with the guidelines set forth in sfas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
under sfas  we are required to record our investment in mortgage servicing rights at the lower of cost or fair value 
the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined based on the discounted future servicing income stratified based on one or more predominant risk characteristics of the underlying loans 
we stratify our mortgage servicing rights by product type and investor to reflect the predominant risks 
to determine the fair value of this investment  we use a valuation model that calculates the present value of discounted future cash flows 
in  we made no material changes to the significant assumptions inherent in the valuation of the servicing portfolio 
these significant assumptions are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
during the year ended december   based on our servicing valuation model  we recorded a net recovery of  compared to a net recovery of million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition  during  we determined that it was remote that million of previously recorded impairment would be recovered  and thus recorded an additional direct write down to the value of the servicing asset for such amount 
all of these impairment recoveries are highly correlated to the changes in interest rates and resultant mortgage loan prepayment speeds that occurred during the periods 
prepayment speeds are highly impacted by changes in interest rates  as when interest rates decline there is a greater incentive for the homeowners to refinance their mortgages 
our impairment reserve as of december  was million 
further decreases in interest rates  or other factors that result in an increase in anticipated future prepayment speeds  may cause additional impairment charges in future years 
to mitigate a portion of this risk of impairment  we have in the past hedged a portion of our investment 
however  based on the underlying characteristics of the portfolio  and our decision not to increase our investment in mortgage servicing  we do not currently anticipate that we will enter into any future hedge specific to our investment for the foreseeable future 
sources of funds 
deposits  short term and long term borrowings  including junior subordinated notes owed to unconsolidated subsidiaries  loan and investment security repayments and proceeds from the sale of securities  and cash flows generated from operations are the primary sources of our funds for lending  investing  and other general purposes 
loan repayments are a relatively predictable source of funds except during periods of significant interest rate declines  while deposit flows tend to fluctuate with prevailing interests rates  money markets conditions  general economic conditions and competition

table of contents statement of cash flows operating activities 
cash flows from operating activities primarily include net income for the year  adjustments for items in net income that did not impact cash and activities related to trading securities and loans held for sale 
net cash provided by operating activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  compared to a use of cash of million for and a use of cash of million for the increase in cash from operating activities is due to a decline in securities trading and a significant decline in the purchase of loans held for sale 
prospectively we do not anticipate that loans purchased for sale will reach the levels of and investing activities 
cash flows from investing activities reflect the impact of loans and investments acquired for the company s interest earning asset portfolios  as well as cash flows from asset purchases and dispositions and security purchases and sales 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to an million increase in loan originations  and approximately million increase in securities available for sale purchased 
for the year ended december   cash flows from investing activities resulted in cash inflows of million from the sale of sba pooled securities that were classified as securities available for sale in financing activities 
cash flows from financing activities include transactions and events whereby cash is obtained from depositors  creditors or investors 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the proceeds from the private placement in which raised million net of certain direct costs  of which million was subsequently used in to fund the tender offer 
offsetting this use of cash was an increase in deposits 
for the year ended december  cash increased from financial activities due to growth of deposits net of deposits sold with the sale of the united western branch bank locations in sun city  arizona and las cruces  new mexico 
inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as prices of goods and services

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk is the risk that the market value or estimated fair value of our assets  liabilities  and derivative financial instruments will decline as a result of changes in interest rates or financial market volatility  or that our net income will be significantly reduced by interest rate changes 
market risk is managed operationally by alco  and is addressed through a selection of funding instruments supporting balance sheet assets  as well as monitoring our asset investment strategies 
asset liability management 
alco establishes policies that monitor and coordinate our sources  uses and pricing of funds and manages interest rate risk discussed below 
we have engaged a third party to provide consulting services to assist us with our asset liability management 
we meet with this consulting firm quarterly to monitor the interest rate risk position and to analyze and discuss strategies related to asset liability management 
we anticipate that we will continue to engage this consulting firm on a quarterly basis to perform quarter end models of interest rate risk and asset liability positions and will use these models as well as our own internal modeling to support asset liability decisions 
interest rate risk 
a significant portion of our operations and ultimate success is partially dependent upon our ability to manage our interest rate risk 
alco continually monitors our sensitivity to interest rate changes 
it is our policy to maintain an acceptable level of interest rate risk over a range of possible changes in interest rates while remaining responsive to market demand for loan and deposit products general market volatility 
management controls our interest rate exposure using several strategies  which include adjusting the maturities of securities in our investment portfolio  and limiting fixed rate loans or fixed rate deposits with terms of more than five years 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our net interest income to adverse movements in interest rates 
although we manage other risks  such as credit  operational and liquidity risk in the normal course of business  we consider interest rate risk to be a significant market risk that could potentially have the largest material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the majority of our market risk related to interest rates exists within the operations of united western bank 
however  matrix financial also has interest rate risk related to its mortgage servicing rights 
this interest rate risk is also very closely related to repayment risk 
at matrix financial  the susceptibility to movements in interest rates affects the cash flows generated from the mortgage servicing rights  which are recorded in other income 
in a decreasing interest rate environment  the underlying servicing portfolio tends to prepay faster  which reduces future servicing income  in an increasing interest rate environment  prepayments tend to decrease  which increases expected future servicing income 
at united western bank we own sba pooled securities and sba purchased loans 
these assets are prime based and generally float with prime on a quarterly basis 
as such  these assets have a relatively low interest rate risk  but a high repayment risk 
because the securities and loans are all prime rate based  and the underlying collateral consists of the guaranteed portion of sba loans  the assets have a higher cost relative to par than the remaining assets owned by united western bank 
as repayments increase this has a negative impact on the yield we earn on these assets 
the majority of our residential loan portfolio continues to be held for sale  which requires us to perform quarterly market valuations of the portfolio in order to properly record the portfolio at the lower of aggregate cost or market 
therefore  we continually monitor the interest rates of our loan portfolio as compared to prevalent interest rates in the market 
we continue to attempt to reduce the volatility in net interest income by managing the relationship of interest rate sensitive assets to interest rate sensitive liabilities 
to accomplish this  we focus on the origination of adjustable rate community bank loans and the acquisition of acquiring floating or hybrid mortgage backed securities 
we also purchase with the intent to sell as pooled securities the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
again  the loans generally adjust with prime and present very little interest rate risk 

table of contents another significant strategy on which we are focused in managing interest rate risk is the identification of lines of business that generate noninterest rate sensitive liabilities 
examples of this strategy are sterling s operations  which administer deposits with relatively low costs  and the bank s and matrix financial s loan servicing functions  which generate no cost escrow deposits 
in the event that yields on our assets and liabilities do adjust to changes in market rates to the same extent  we may still be exposed to yield curve risk 
yield curve risk reflects the possibility the changes in the shape of the yield curve could have different effects on our assets and liabilities
