index to financial statements performance graph the following graph compares the performance of our common units with the performance of the nasdaq market index the nasdaq index and a peer group index from the first day of trading of our common units  february   through december  the graph assumes that at the beginning of the period  was invested in each of our common units  the nasdaq index  and the peer group  and that all distributions or dividends were reinvested 
we do not believe that any published industry or line of business index accurately reflects our business 
accordingly  we have created a special peer group index consisting of companies whose royalty trust units are publicly traded on the new york stock exchange 
our peer group index includes the units of the following companies cross timbers royalty trust  mesa royalty trust  sabine royalty trust  permian basin royalty trust  hugoton royalty trust and the san juan basin royalty trust

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies we utilize the full cost method of accounting for costs related to our oil and gas properties 
under this method  all such costs are capitalized and amortized on an aggregate basis over the estimated lives of the properties using the units of production method 
these capitalized costs are subject to a ceiling test however  which limits such pooled costs to the aggregate of the present value of future net revenues attributable to proved oil and gas reserves discounted at plus the lower of cost or market value of unproved properties 
our partnership did not assign any book or market value to unproved properties  including non producing royalty  mineral and leasehold interests 
the full cost ceiling is evaluated at the end of each quarter and when events indicate possible impairment 
for  our unamortized costs of oil and gas properties exceeded the ceiling test 
as a result  in  our partnership recorded full cost write downs of  no additional impairments have been recorded since the quarter ended september  
table of contents 
index to financial statements the discounted present value of our proved oil and gas reserves is a major component of the ceiling calculation and requires many subjective judgments 
estimates of reserves are forecasts based on engineering and geological analyses 
different reserve engineers may reach different conclusions as to estimated quantities of natural gas or crude oil reserves based on the same information 
our reserve estimates are prepared by independent consultants 
the passage of time provides more qualitative information regarding reserve estimates  and revisions are made to prior estimates based on updated information 
however  there can be no assurance that more significant revisions will not be necessary in the future 
significant downward revisions could result in an impairment representing a non cash charge to earnings 
in addition to the impact on calculation of the ceiling test  estimates of proved reserves are also a major component of the calculation of depletion 
while the quantities of proved reserves require substantial judgment  the associated prices of oil and gas reserves that are included in the discounted present value of our reserves are objectively determined 
the ceiling test calculation requires use of prices and costs in effect as of the last day of the accounting period  which are generally held constant for the life of the properties 
as a result  the present value is not necessarily an indication of the fair value of the reserves 
oil and gas prices have historically been volatile and the prevailing prices at any given time may not reflect our partnership s or the industry s forecast of future prices 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
for example  estimates of uncollected revenues and unpaid expenses from royalties and net profits interests in properties operated by non affiliated entities are particularly subjective due to inability to gain accurate and timely information 
therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates

index to financial statements results of operations normally  our period to period changes in net earnings and cash flows from operating activities are principally determined by changes in oil and natural gas sales volumes and prices  and to a lesser extent  by capital expenditures deducted under the net profits interests calculation 
our portion of oil and gas sales volumes and weighted average sales prices are shown in the following table 
years ended december  accrual basis sales volumes royalty properties gas sales mmcf royalty properties oil sales mbbls net profits interests gas sales mmcf net profits interests oil sales mbbls accrual basis weighted averages sales price royalty properties gas sales mcf royalty properties oil sales bbl net profits interests gas sales mcf net profits interests oil sales bbl accrual basis production costs deducted under the net profits interests mcfe provided to assist in determination of revenues  applies only to net profit interest sales volumes prices 
comparison of the twelve month periods ended december   and royalty properties oil sales volumes increased from mbbls during to mbbls during and then decreased to mbbls during royalty properties gas sales volumes increased from  mmcf during to  mmcf during and then increased to  mmcf during the changes in royalty property oil and gas sales volumes are attributable to new wells drilled in late and  offset by natural reservoir declines 
see discussion in item properties royalty properties drilling activity 
net profits interests properties oil sales volumes increased from mbbls during to mbbls during  and then increased to mbbls during primarily as a result of improved production in north dakota properties 
net profits interests properties gas sales volumes decreased from  mmcf during to  mmcf during and subsequently decreased to  mmcf in principally as a result of natural reservoir depletion in the guymon hugoton field in oklahoma

index to financial statements general and administrative costs increased slightly from  in to  in those same costs decreased from  in to  in primarily due to the completion of the partnership s office relocation in and increased costs related to the acquisition of properties in late depletion and amortization was  in compared to  in compared to  in primarily as a result of a lower depletable base due to the effects of previous depletion and upward revisions in oil and gas reserve estimates 
cash flow from operations and cash distributions to unitholders are not affected by depletion  depreciation and amortization 
net cash provided by operating activities increased from  during to  during and increased to  during due primarily to the effects of increased oil and natural gas sales prices from to and increased lease bonus from to texas margin tax the texas legislature recently passed hb which is a new tax system  commonly referred to as the texas margin tax 
the texas margin tax applies to corporations and limited liability companies  general and limited partnerships unless otherwise exempt  limited liability partnerships  trusts unless otherwise exempt  business trusts  business associations  professional associations  joint stock companies  holding companies  and joint ventures 
the effective date of the texas margin tax is january   but the tax generally will be imposed on gross revenues generated in and thereafter 
limited partnerships that receive at least of their gross income from designated passive sources  including royalties from mineral properties and other non operated mineral interest income  and do not receive more than of their income from operating an active trade or business  are generally exempt from the texas margin tax as passive entities 
our partnership should meet the requirements for being considered a passive entity for texas margin tax purposes and  therefore  it should be exempt from the texas margin tax 
if exempt from tax at the partnership level as a passive entity  each unitholder that is considered a taxable entity under the texas margin tax would generally be required to include its texas portion of partnership revenues in its own texas margin tax computation 
each unitholder is urged to consult his own tax advisor regarding the requirements for filing state income  franchise and texas margin tax returns 
liquidity and capital resources capital resources our primary sources of capital are our cash flow from the net profits interests and the royalty properties 
our only cash requirements are the distributions to our unitholders  the payment of oil and gas production and property taxes not otherwise deducted from gross production revenues and general and administrative expenses incurred on our behalf and allocated in accordance with our partnership agreement 
since the distributions to our unitholders are  by definition  determined after the payment of all expenses actually paid by us  the only cash requirements that may create liquidity concerns for us are the payments of expenses 
since most of these expenses vary directly with oil and natural gas prices and sales volumes  we anticipate that sufficient funds will be available at all times for payment of these expenses 
see item market for registrant s common equity  related unitholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for the amounts and dates of cash distributions to our unitholders 
we are not directly liable for the payment of any exploration  development or production costs 
we do not have any transactions  arrangements or other relationships that could materially affect our liquidity or the availability of capital resources

expenses and capital expenditures during february the operating partnership drilled one replacement guymon hugoton well and one council grove formation well  both in oklahoma 
the guymon hugoton well is awaiting completion operations 
the council grove well was a dry hole costing approximately  final cost of the replacement guymon hugoton well is expected to be during  depending upon rig availability  the operating partnership anticipates drilling one additional well in the oklahoma council grove formation 
the operating partnership does not otherwise currently anticipate drilling additional wells as a working interest owner operator in the oklahoma or kansas properties 
successful activities by others or other developments could prompt a reevaluation of this position 
present drilling and completion costs are estimated at   per well 
such activities by the operating partnership could influence the amount we receive from the net profits interests 
during the fourth quarter  the operating partnership deepened one oklahoma well 
results are awaiting clean out operations 
costs are expected to total  the operating partnership anticipates continuing fracture treating in its oklahoma properties but is unable to predict the cost as a specific engineering study is required for each fracture treatment 
previous fracture treatments in these properties have cost between  and  per well 
they did not require casing repairs 
such activities by the operating partnership could influence the amount we receive from the net profits interests 
the operating partnership owns and operates the wells  pipelines and gas compression and dehydration facilities located in kansas and oklahoma 
the operating partnership anticipates gradual increases in expenses as repairs to these facilities become more frequent  and anticipates gradual increases in field operating expenses as reservoir pressure declines 
the operating partnership does not anticipate incurring significant expense to replace these facilities at this time 
these capital and operating costs are reflected in the net profits interests payments we receive from the operating partnership 
in  oklahoma regulations removed production quantity restrictions in the guymon hugoton field  and did not address efforts by third parties to persuade oklahoma to permit infill drilling in the guymon hugoton field 
infill drilling could require considerable capital expenditures 
the outcome and the cost of such activities are unpredictable and could influence the amount we receive from the net profits interests 
the operating partnership believes it now has sufficient field compression and permits for vacuum operation for the foreseeable future

index to financial statements distributions distributions to limited partners and general partners related to cash receipts for the period from october through december were as follows year quarter record date payment date per unit amount limited partners general partners in thousands th january  february  st may  may   nd july  august   rd october  november  total distributions paid in th january  february  in general  the limited partners are allocated of the royalty properties net receipts and of our net profits interest receipts 
net profits interests we receive monthly payments from the operating partnership equal to of the net proceeds actually realized by the operating partnership from the properties underlying the net profits interests 
the operating partnership retains the balance of these net proceeds 
net proceeds generally reflect gross proceeds attributable to oil and natural gas production actually received during the month less production costs actually paid during the same month 
production costs generally reflect drilling  completion  operating and general and administrative costs and exclude depletion  amortization and other non cash costs 
the operating partnership made net profits interests payments to us totaling  during october through september  which payments reflected of total net proceeds of  realized from september through august net proceeds realized by the operating partnership during september through november were reflected in net profits interests payments made during october through december these payments were included in the fourth quarter distribution paid in early and are excluded from this analysis 
royalty properties revenues from the royalty properties are typically paid to us with proportionate severance production taxes deducted and remitted by others 
additionally  we generally pay ad valorem taxes  general and administrative costs  and marketing and associated costs since royalties and lease bonuses generally do not otherwise bear operating or similar costs 
after deduction of the above described costs including cash reserves  our net cash receipts from the royalty properties during the period october through september were   of which was distributed to the limited partners and  of which was distributed to the general partner 
proceeds received by us from the royalty properties during the period october through december became part of the fourth quarter distribution paid in early  which is excluded from this analysis

index to financial statements distribution determinations the actual calculation of distributions is performed each calendar quarter in accordance with our partnership agreement 
the following calculation covering the period october through september demonstrates the method

due to these fixed percentages  our general partner does not have any incentive distribution rights or other right or arrangement which will increase its percentage share of net cash generated by our activities or those of the operating partnership 
during the period october through september  our partnership s quarterly distribution payments to limited partners were based on all of its available cash 
our partnership s only significant cash reserves that influenced quarterly payments were  for ad valorem taxes 
additionally  certain production costs under the net profits interests calculation and a small portion of management expense reimbursements include amounts for which funds were set aside monthly to enable payment when due 
examples are pension contributions and payroll taxes 
these amounts generally are not held for periods over one year 
fourth quarter distribution indicated price in an effort to provide the reader with information concerning prices of oil and gas sales that correspond to our quarterly distributions  management calculates the weighted average price by dividing gross revenues received by the net volumes of the corresponding product without regard to the timing of the production to which such sales may be attributable 
this indicated price does not necessarily reflect the contractual terms for such sales and may be affected by transportation costs  location differentials  and quality and gravity adjustments 
while the relationship between the partnership s cash receipts and the timing of the production of oil and gas may be described generally  actual cash receipts may be materially impacted by purchasers release of suspended funds and by prior period adjustments 
cash receipts attributable to the partnership s net profits interests during the fourth quarter totaled  these receipts generally reflect oil and gas sales from the properties underlying the net profits interests during august through october the weighted average indicated prices for oil and gas sales during the fourth quarter attributable to the net profits interests were bbl and mcf  respectively 
cash receipts attributable to the partnership s royalty properties during the fourth quarter totaled  these receipts generally reflect oil sales during september through november and gas sales during august through october the weighted average indicated prices for oil and gas sales during the fourth quarter attributable to the royalty properties were bbl and mcf  respectively

index to financial statements general and administrative costs in accordance with our partnership agreement  we bear all general and administrative and other overhead expenses subject to certain limitations 
we reimburse our general partner for certain allocable costs  including rent  wages  salaries and employee benefit plans 
this reimbursement is limited to an amount equal to the sum of of our distributions plus certain costs previously paid 
through december   the limitation was substantially in excess of the reimbursement amounts actually paid or accrued 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following information provides quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposures to market risk 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and natural gas prices  interest rates and currency exchange rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
market risk related to oil and natural gas prices essentially all of our assets and sources of income are from the net profits interests and the royalty properties  which generally entitle us to receive a share of the proceeds from oil and natural gas production on those properties 
consequently  we are subject to market risk from fluctuations in oil and natural gas prices 
pricing for oil and natural gas production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
we do not anticipate entering into financial hedging activities intended to reduce our exposure to oil and natural gas price fluctuations 
absence of interest rate and currency exchange rate risk we do not anticipate having a credit facility or incurring any debt  other than trade debt 
therefore  we do not expect interest rate risk to be material to us 
we do not anticipate engaging in transactions in foreign currencies which could expose us to foreign currency related market risk
