our business segments we operate our business in two business segments united solar ovonic and ovonic materials 
these segments were created in april as part of an organizational restructuring to consolidate and realign business activities and reduce operating costs 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview 
financial information regarding each segment is available in note l  business segments  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents united solar ovonic our united solar ovonic segment designs  develops  manufactures and sells pv modules that generate clean  renewable energy by converting sunlight into electricity 
this business  which we conduct through our wholly owned subsidiary  united solar ovonic llc  is based principally on our pioneering technologies for thin film amorphous silicon pv modules and low cost  roll to roll manufacturing 
our pv modules are lightweight  thin  flexible and durable and can be integrated directly with roofing materials for a seamless appearance 
conventional pv products  which currently represent over of the solar modules sold globally  are made of crystalline or polycrystalline silicon and are covered in glass enclosed by a metal frame 
our pv modules are typically foot laminates without a frame and have several competitive advantages over conventional pv products  including greater electricity generation per rated power output  no use of polysilicon material  which is currently in short supply  simpler  lower cost installation for building integrated pv applications  greater durability  lighter weight  better aesthetics  more applications  and greater opportunity to reduce product cost and increase profitability with higher production volumes 
we sell our pv modules principally for commercial and industrial roofing applications 
we believe that we have a strategic competitive advantage because our pv modules are readily adaptable for seamless integration into various roofing materials 
we sell most of our modules to commercial roofing materials manufacturers  builders and building contractors  and solar power installers integrators  who incorporate our pv modules into their products and services for commercial sale and then handle all aspects of the consumer relationship  including marketing  sales and service 
we also sell pv modules for ground mounted and residential applications and  for some applications  manufacture and sell framed pv products 
our strategic customers include solar integrated technologies inc sit  biohaus pv handels gmbh biohaus  alwitra flachdach systeme gmbh  corus bausysteme gmbh  hoesch contecna systembau  unimetal spa  sunedison  llc  advanced green technologies  inc a unit of advanced roofing  inc and actus lend lease a subsidiary of lend lease corp 
ltd 
sales to sit represented and  respectively  of our product sales in this segment for the fiscal years ended june  and sales to biohaus represented of our product sales in this segment for each of the fiscal years ended june  and we compete with companies that currently manufacture and distribute products based on well established technologies for electricity generation  as well as companies that currently manufacture and distribute products based on alternative energy generation technologies  such as solar and wind 
our principal competitors in the solar market include sharp corporation  q cells ag  kyocera corporation  sanyo electric co  ltd 
sanyo  sunpower corp  mitsubishi electric corporation and suntech power holdings co  ltd  all of which manufacture predominantly crystalline or polycrystalline silicon pv modules  and first solar  inc  which manufactures thin film  cadmium telluride pv modules on glass substrates 
the competitiveness of alternative energy generation products in general  including solar power products  is typically enhanced by governmental incentives designed to encourage the use of these products as compared to conventional energy generation sources  which today are less expensive at the customer level in most locations 
however  our long term goal is to compete directly  without subsidies  in energy markets 

table of contents our long term research and development strategy involves reducing cost and improving the throughput of our pv module manufacturing equipment  reducing the cost of pv module production  increasing the sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of our pv modules and reducing the overall cost of systems incorporating our pv modules 
we seek to offset our research and development costs in this segment with third party funding  including product development agreements and government funding 
for example  in july we entered into a three year cooperative agreement in which we will receive approximately million from the department of energy under an innovative  new program  the solar america initiative  to increase the efficiency of our photovoltaic products  lower materials costs and develop innovative installation methods in order to reduce overall system costs 
we manufacture our pv modules using our proprietary vacuum deposition and large scale  roll to roll manufacturing processes to deposit amorphous silicon as a thin film on a large roll of stainless steel 
we design  develop and manufacture and have made the automated production equipment based on these proprietary process technologies 
we believe that consolidating our pv equipment design and manufacturing activities with our pv module manufacturing activities allows us to more effectively improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce capital costs 
the key raw materials used in our united solar ovonic segment business are stainless steel  high purity industrial gases  primarily argon  nitrogen  hydrogen  silane and germane  and polymer materials 
we believe that we have adequate sources for the supply of key raw materials and components for our pv module manufacturing needs 
we have  in certain instances  selected single source suppliers for certain key raw materials and components for efficiency  cost and quality 
the cost of certain raw materials  in particular stainless steel and resin based polymer materials  has risen over the last several years  and we are actively managing these costs through purchasing strategies and product design and operating improvements 
our operations are not impacted by the current shortage of polysilicon a key raw material for conventional pv products that is affecting most of our competitors through higher costs and limited availability 
we have entered into long term supply agreements with certain of our customers 
these agreements establish an overall framework for supplying our pv products  containing key terms  such as pricing  and are an important component in developing and maintaining long term supply relationships with these customers 
our product sales under these long term supply agreements  which do not contain minimum firm purchase commitments  and with other customers are completed on a current basis via purchase orders issued by the customers as they require our pv products 
therefore  our backlog of orders for pv products reflects only a limited snapshot of orders we expect to recognize as revenue  and we therefore do not believe it provides a meaningful indicator of future revenues 
our united solar ovonic segment is headquartered in auburn hills  michigan  and has manufacturing facilities in auburn hills and tijuana  mexico 
to meet present and expected demand  we are in the process of rapidly expanding our manufacturing capacity from the current mw per annum to an expected capacity exceeding mw by by adding new manufacturing facilities  as well as constantly improving our products and process efficiencies 
our two manufacturing facilities in auburn hills have a combined capacity of mw per annum to manufacture pv cells and finished pv modules 
we are presently constructing two facilities in greenville  michigan  each with a capacity of mw per annum  to manufacture pv cells  which will then be used in the assembly of finished pv modules at facilities in tijuana  mexico  and tianjin  china 
the tianjin pv module assembly facility will be owned and operated by a chinese 
table of contents joint venture company of which we own and the remaining is owned by tianjin jinneng investment company 
the first greenville manufacturing facility is expected to begin operation in late calendar  and the second facility is expected to begin operation in mid calendar year  bringing our total manufacturing capacity to approximately mw per annum 
ovonic materials our ovonic materials segment invents  designs and develops materials and products based on our pioneering materials science technology  principally amorphous and disordered materials 
we seek to commercialize this technology internally and through third party relationships  such as licenses and joint ventures 
we are presently commercializing our nimh materials and consumer battery technology through this segment 
we are also engaged in pre commercialization activities for our emerging technologies  the funding of which we seek to offset with royalties and licensing revenues from this segment and third party funding  including joint ventures  product development agreements and government funding 
nimh batteries nimh batteries are rechargeable energy storage solutions offering high power  long cycle life and maintenance free operation 
they are adaptable to a broad range of consumer  transportation and stationary applications 
products utilizing our nimh battery technology compete with lead acid  nickel cadmium and lithium battery technologies 
nimh batteries produce superior energy and power for their weight and volume and have a longer cycle life compared to lead acid and nickel cadmium batteries 
in addition  nimh batteries have no memory effect and do not contain cadmium or lead  both environmentally hazardous substances 
nimh technology has numerous advantages over lithium ion technology  such as lower cost  greater safety and improved durability and abuse tolerance

we produce proprietary high performance positive electrode nickel hydroxide materials for use in nimh batteries  which we sell to licensees of our nimh battery technology 
while these licensees are not required to purchase our materials in order to manufacture nimh batteries using the licensed nimh technology  our positive electrode materials offer advantages such as higher capacity and power  greater cycle life  high temperature performance and lower costs 
sales to gold peak industries represented and  respectively  of our nimh materials product sales and and  respectively  of our total revenues in this segment for the fiscal years ended june  and we conduct our manufacturing operations at an automated facility in troy  michigan 
the key raw materials used in our nickel hydroxide business are primarily nickel and cobalt 
all of the raw materials used are generally readily available from numerous sources  but interruptions in production or delivery of key raw materials could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations in this segment 
prices for these raw materials may fluctuate in the normal course of business due to supply and demand 
our product pricing formula to our customers includes a variable sales price based on the raw material price 
emerging technologies our research and development activities have generated new technologies to address important societal needs  which we are seeking to bring to full scale commercialization 
these technologies  some of which are discussed below  are subject to further development and will require substantial additional funding to reach commercial product status 
we seek to offset our funding requirements by obtaining third party funding through strategic alliances and government contracts 
ovonic solid hydrogen storage technologies 
hydrogen is a clean and efficient fuel source that yields more energy per unit of weight than any other combustible fuel  and we are developing a practical approach to storing hydrogen in a solid metal matrix at low pressures using a family of new  efficient metal hydrides 
our solid hydrogen storage solutions have several advantages over conventional gaseous and liquid storage solutions  including improved volumetric density and greater safety due to our technology s low pressure refilling and storage capabilities

table of contents our technology and intellectual property the principal markets in which we compete the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets are characterized by rapid change and competition driven by technological and product performance advantages 
we have driven some of this activity through our pioneering and proprietary materials  product and production process technologies 
at the same time  we are actively engaged in product design and development to commercialize and improve our materials  products and production processes 
research and development expenditures our research and development expenditures are reflected as cost of revenues from product development agreements and product development and research expenses in our statements of operations in our consolidated financial statements 
we seek to offset our research and development costs with third party funding  including joint ventures  product development agreements and government funding 
competition since our businesses are based upon our pioneering technologies that offer fundamental solutions in the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets  we compete not only at the product level for market share but also at the technology level for market acceptance 
our competition includes well established conventional technologies  other alternative technology solutions and other technologies within an alternative solution 
for example  our pv technology competes with conventional electricity generation technologies  such as gas and coal  alternative electricity generation technologies  such as wind and nuclear  and other solar technologies  such as crystalline products 
our business competitors include some of the world s largest industrial companies  many of which are pursuing new technology solutions in addition to their well established conventional technologies 
we believe that we have derived a key business and technological advantage through our research and development activities by continuously inventing new technologies and improving our existing materials  products and production processes 
however  even as we successfully pursue these research and development activities  some of our technologies  particularly in the alternative energy generation and energy storage markets  presently face commercial barriers as compared to well established conventional technologies  including infrastructural barriers  customer transition costs and higher manufacturing costs associated with present production volumes 
the competitiveness of products based on our technologies in these areas is typically enhanced by external factors  including rising energy costs  concerns regarding energy security and governmental incentives at the customer level 
our long term goal is to compete directly in energy markets without subsidies 
patents and intellectual property we maintain an extensive patent portfolio presently consisting of over us patents and over foreign counterparts including patents assigned to a joint venture partner  to which we are regularly adding new patents based upon our continuing research and development activities 
importantly  our portfolio includes numerous basic and fundamental patents applicable 
table of contents to each of our business segments  covering not only materials  but also the production technology and products we develop 
based on the breadth and depth of our patent portfolio  we believe that our proprietary patent position is sustainable notwithstanding the expiration of certain patents 
we do not expect the expiration of any patents to materially affect the business prospects of any of our business segments 
our employees as of august   we and our consolidated subsidiaries had a total of employees in the us and employees outside of the us these numbers do not include employees of our joint ventures or licensees

item a risk factors we have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain 
since our founding  we have incurred substantial net losses in connection with the research  development and commercialization of products based on our technologies 
our ability to achieve profitability in the future is uncertain and will depend largely on the successful commercialization of our products  as to which there can be no assurance 
if we do not achieve or sustain profitability or otherwise meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the market price of our common stock may decline 
we expect that we will need to obtain significant additional financing to continue to operate our business  including significant capital expenditures to increase our production capacity  and financing may be unavailable or available only on disadvantageous terms 
we have in the past experienced substantial losses and negative cash flow from operations and have required significant financing  including equity financing and financing provided through capital and operating leases of facilities  in order to pursue the commercialization of products based on our technologies 
we expect that we will continue to need significant financing to operate our business  including capital expenditures to expand our production capacity 
in particular  we believe that we will require additional funding for manufacturing capacity expansion in our united solar ovonic segment from the current mw per annum to an expected capacity exceeding mw per annum by there can be no assurance that such additional financing will be available or that the terms of such additional financing  if available  will 
table of contents be acceptable to us 
if additional financing is not available or not available on terms acceptable to us  our ability to fund our operations  develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network  maintain our research and development efforts or otherwise respond to competitive pressures may be significantly impaired 
we are rapidly expanding our manufacturing capacity for pv products in order to meet expected demand  and our revenues and profits will depend upon our ability to successfully complete this expansion and then to sell our pv products at higher volumes to match our expanded capacity 
we plan to continue the expansion of our manufacturing capacity from the current mw per annum to an expected capacity exceeding mw per annum by this expansion plan includes adding new facilities in greenville  michigan the first facility of which is expected to begin operation in late calendar and the second in mid calendar year  tijuana  mexico and tianjin  china 
we are designing  developing  manufacturing  installing and testing the equipment for this expansion internally and through third parties 
we may experience delays  additional or unexpected costs and other adverse events in connection with our capacity expansion projects  including those associated with the equipment we are providing 
additionally  there can be no assurance that market demand will align with our expanding manufacturing capacity or that our marketing capabilities at the expanded manufacturing volumes will be successful 
as a result  we may not be able to realize revenues and profits based upon the expected capacity  or we may experience delays or reductions in these revenues and profits  and our business could be materially adversely affected 
we have international operations  which we are expanding  that are vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
we have a pv module manufacturing facility in tijuana  mexico  and have established a joint venture in tianjin  china  to manufacture pv modules 
also  a significant portion of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
international operations and transactions are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad  including exposure to local economic conditions  expropriation and nationalization  foreign exchange rate fluctuations and currency controls  withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries  investment restrictions or requirements  and export and import restrictions 
in addition  since expanding our business globally is an important element of our strategy  our exposure to these risks will be greater in the future 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 
however  any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our profitability 
a portion of our revenues and profits are dependent upon licensing arrangements and joint ventures  and our licensees and joint venture partners may be unwilling or unable to devote their financial resources and manufacturing and marketing capabilities to commercialize products based on our technologies 
we have entered into licensing and joint venture agreements with established industrial companies in order to develop and commercialize certain products based on our technologies 
any revenues or profits which may be derived by us from these licensing and joint venture agreements will be substantially dependent upon the willingness and ability of our licensees and joint venture partners to devote their financial resources and manufacturing and marketing 
table of contents capabilities to commercialize products based on our technologies 
there can be no assurance that such financial resources will be available or that such commercialization will be successful 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that our joint ventures will continue to operate 
if our joint venture partners provide additional financing to our joint ventures  it may be on terms that result in a reduction in our ownership interest in the joint ventures or that otherwise reduce any profits we may realize from the joint ventures 
if any of our joint ventures are terminated  there can be no assurance that we will be able to attract new joint venture partners to continue the activities of the terminated joint venture 
if our licensees and joint venture partners are unwilling or unable to devote their financial resources and manufacturing and marketing capabilities to commercialize products based on our technologies  or if any of o ur joint ventures are terminated  we may not be able to realize revenues and profits based on our technologies and our business could be materially adversely affected 
additional research and development efforts will be required before certain products based on our technologies can be manufactured and sold commercially  and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
additional research and development efforts by us  our licensees or our joint ventures will be required before certain products based on our technologies may be manufactured and sold commercially 
the commercialization of products based on our technologies depends upon consumer acceptance and the achievement and verification of the overall performance  cost  reliability  efficiency and safety of the products 
there can be no assurance that such research and development efforts will be successful or that we  our licensees or our joint ventures will be able to develop commercial applications for our products and technologies 
further  the areas in which we are developing technologies and products are characterized by rapid and significant technological change 
rapid technological development may result in our products becoming obsolete or noncompetitive 
if future products based on our technologies cannot be developed for manufacture and sold commercially or our products become obsolete or noncompetitive  we may be unable to recover our investments or achieve profitability 
in addition  the commercialization schedule may be delayed if we  our licensees or our joint ventures experience delays in meeting development goals  if products based on our technologies exhibit technical defects  or if we  our licensees or our joint ventures are unable to meet cost or performance goals 
in this event  potential purchasers of products based on our technologies may choose alternative technologies and any delays could allow potential competitors to gain market advantages 
it is uncertain that the market will accept our products once the technology has been developed and commercial scale manufacturing has been achieved 
there can be no assurance that products based on our technologies will be perceived as being superior to existing products or new products being developed by competing companies or that such products will otherwise be accepted by consumers 
the market prices for products based on our technologies may exceed the prices of competitive products based on existing technologies or new products based on technologies currently under development by competitors 
there can be no assurance that the prices of products based on our technologies will be perceived by consumers as cost effective or that the prices of such products will be competitive with existing products or with other new products or technologies 
if consumers do not accept products based on our technologies  we may be unable to recover our investments or achieve profitability 

table of contents we and our joint ventures and licensees may not be able to manufacture products based on our technologies successfully on a commercial scale 
there can be no assurance that we and our joint ventures and licensees will be able to successfully manufacture products based on our technologies 
in order to produce products on a commercial scale  we and our joint ventures and licensees will be required to establish or significantly increase manufacturing capabilities currently being used to produce certain of our products 
although substantially all of our joint venture partners and licensees have experience in commercial scale manufacturing  we have little such experience and there can be no assurance that we or our joint ventures and licensees will expand or establish capabilities for manufacturing products beyond those presently in existence 
if commercial scale manufacturing of products based on our technologies is not achieved  we may be unable to recover our investments or achieve profitability 
we and our joint ventures and licensees may experience performance problems with key suppliers or subcontractors 
we and our joint ventures and licensees are highly dependent on the continued services of a limited number of key suppliers and subcontractors 
the loss of any of these suppliers and subcontractors could have a material adverse effect on us and on our joint ventures and licensees 
there can be no assurance that existing relationships with key suppliers and subcontractors will continue on acceptable terms and  if not continued  our business could be materially adversely affected 
other companies  many of which have greater resources than we have  may develop competing products or technologies which cause products based on our technologies to become obsolete or noncompetitive 
we and our joint ventures and licensees currently compete with firms  both domestic and foreign  that perform research and development  as well as firms that manufacture and sell products 
in addition  we expect additional potential competitors to enter the markets for our products in the future 
some of these current and potential competitors are among the largest industrial companies in the world with longer operating histories  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases  significantly more well established business organizations and product lines and significantly greater resources and research and development staff and facilities 
there can be no assurance that one or more such companies will not succeed in developing technologies or products that will become available for commercial sale prior to our products  that will have performance superior to products based on our technologies or that would otherwise render our products obsolete or noncompetitive 
if we fail to compete successfully  our business would suffer and we may lose or be unable to gain market share 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers 
we historically have entered into agreements with a relatively small number of major customers throughout the world 
our five largest customers represented approximately and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
our revenues would decrease substantially if we were to lose any major customer and unable to offset this loss through reallocation of production or additional sales 

table of contents adverse business or financial conditions affecting the automotive industry may have a material adverse effect on our cobasys joint venture and our nimh battery business 
cobasys  our joint venture with chevron  designs  manufactures and sells high power commercial nimh batteries and systems for hybrid electric vehicles  or hevs 
the principal customers for the nimh batteries and systems manufactured by cobasys are the major domestic and international automotive manufacturers 
certain of these manufacturers have in recent years experienced static or reduced revenues  increased costs  loss of market share  labor issues and other business and financial challenges 
adverse business or financial conditions affecting individual automotive manufacturers or the automotive industry generally could have a material adverse effect on our cobasys joint venture and our nimh battery business 
automotive manufacturers may discontinue or delay their planned introduction of hevs as a result of adverse changes in their financial condition or other factors 
automotive manufacturers may also seek alternative battery systems from other suppliers which may be more cost effective or require fewer modifications in standard manufacturing processes than the battery systems manufactured by cobasys 
additionally  lithium ion batteries may displace nimh in future hybrid vehicles 
we or cobasys may also experience delays or losses with respect to the collection of payments due from customers in the automotive industry experiencing financial difficulties 
our cobasys joint venture continues to require substantial additional funding  which we may be required to provide beginning in january chevron is presently funding cobasys operations by acquiring a preferred interest in cobasys for which it is entitled to a priority right of repayment 
we and chevron have agreed to explore strategic alternatives regarding cobasys that are intended to fund cobasys operations and to enable cobasys to further capitalize on global opportunities for integrated energy storage solutions in the growing hybrid electric vehicle and stationary power industries 
this process is continuing  and the timing and nature of a particular strategic alternative to be consummated  if any  has not been concluded 
beginning in january  the joint venture partners may be required to make capital contributions as necessary to fund approved operating budgets in proportion to their percentage membership interests  subject to the terms of the cobasys operating agreement 
we may be unable or unwilling to fund these capital contributions  in which case we may be subject to the remedies set forth in the cobasys operating agreement  including dilution 
our government product development and research contracts may be terminated by unilateral government action  or we may be unsuccessful in obtaining new government contracts to replace those which have been terminated or completed 
we have several government product development and research contracts 
any revenues or profits which may be derived by us from these contracts will be substantially dependent upon the government agencies willingness to continue to devote their financial resources to our research and development efforts 
there can be no assurance that such financial resources will be available or that such research and development efforts will be successful 
our government contracts may be terminated for the convenience of the government at any time  even if we have fully performed our obligations under the contracts 
upon a termination for convenience  we would generally only be entitled to recover certain eligible costs and expenses we had incurred prior to termination and would not be entitled to any other payments or damages 
therefore  if government product development and research contracts are terminated or completed and we are 
table of contents unsuccessful in obtaining replacement government contracts  our revenues and profits may decline and our business may be adversely affected 
the reduction or elimination of government incentives related to solar power could cause our revenues to decline 
today  the cost of solar power exceeds the cost of power furnished by the electric utility grid in most locations 
as a result  federal  state and local government bodies in many countries  most notably germany  japan  italy  spain  france  greece and the united states  have provided incentives in the form of rebates  tax credits and other incentives to end users  distributors  system integrators and manufacturers of solar power products to promote the use of solar energy to reduce dependency on other forms of energy 
these government economic incentives could be reduced or eliminated 
reductions in  or eliminations or expirations of  incentives related to solar power could result in decreased demand for our solar modules and lower our revenue 
we may suffer the loss of key personnel or may be unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of a limited number of skilled managers  scientists and technicians 
the loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  our success will depend upon  among other factors  the recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced management and technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing employees or to attract and retain additional personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel in industrial  academic and nonprofit research sectors 
high raw material costs could impact our profitability and our ability to successfully develop our emerging technologies 
higher costs for certain raw materials and commodities  principally steel  resin based polymers and nickel  as well as higher energy costs  could negatively impact our profitability 
while we have developed strategies to mitigate or partially offset the impact of higher raw material  commodity and energy costs  there can be no assurances such measures will be successful 
in addition  no assurances can be given that the magnitude and duration of these cost increases or any future cost increases will not have a larger adverse impact on our profitability and consolidated financial position than currently anticipated 
additionally  certain of our emerging technologies utilize high cost raw materials 
as part of our continuing research and development activities  we are attempting to substantially reduce these costs through material reduction and substitution strategies 
there can be no assurances that we will succeed in these cost reduction efforts  which are essential for the development of our emerging technologies 
we may become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings which may reach unfavorable resolutions 
we are involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
due to the inherent uncertainties of legal proceedings  the outcome of any such proceeding could be unfavorable  and we may choose to make payments or enter into other arrangements  to settle such proceedings 
failure to settle such proceedings could require us to pay damages or other 
table of contents expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have been subject to legal proceedings in the past involving the validity and enforceability of certain of our patents 
while such patent related legal proceedings have been resolved  such proceedings can require the expenditure of substantial management time and financial resources and can adversely affect our financial performance 
there can be no assurance that we will not be a party to other legal proceedings in the future 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with these laws  rules and regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance 
moreover  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder could require us to make significant capital expenditures 
the operation of a manufacturing plant entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs and liabilities in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
in addition  we generate hazardous materials and other wastes that are disposed of at licensed disposal facilities 
we may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances by such facilities into the environment 
our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology including our trade secrets and other confidential information 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for products based on our technologies 
our policy is to seek to protect our products and technologies by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements 
the patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
our ability to maintain our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted 
we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents 
our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged  invalidated  rendered unenforceable or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products and technologies 
in addition  the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar products or technologies 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property 
because of the extensive time required for development and commercialization of products based on our technologies  it is possible that  before these products can be commercialized  any related patents may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization  thereby reducing any advantages of these patents and making it unlikely that we will be able to recover investments we have made to develop our technologies and products based on our technologies 

table of contents in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  agents and consultants upon the commencement of their relationships with us 
these agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
our agreements with employees also provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property 
individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms 
in the event of the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information  these agreements  even if obtained  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information 
to the extent that our employees or consultants use technology or know how owned by others in their work for us  disputes may arise as to the rights in related inventions 
adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information 
the disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  which could be expensive and time consuming 
competitors may infringe our patents 
to counter infringement or unauthorized use  we may be required to file patent infringement claims  which can be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable  or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
interference proceedings brought by the united states patent and trademark office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings may fail and  even if successful  may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management 
we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the united states 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure 
in addition  during the course of this litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we may not prevail in any litigation or interference proceeding in which we are involved 
even if we do prevail  these proceedings can be expensive and distract our management 

table of contents third parties may own or control patents or patent applications that are infringed by our products or technologies 
our success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties patents and proprietary rights 
in the united states and most other countries  patent applications are published months after filing 
as a result  there may be patents of which we are unaware  and avoiding patent infringement may be difficult 
we may inadvertently infringe third party patents or patent applications 
these third parties could bring claims against us that  even if resolved in our favor  could cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if resolved against us  could additionally cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us  we and our joint venture partners and licensees could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of products based on our technologies in the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe  unless we can obtain a license from the patent holder 
such a license may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  particularly if the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with products based on our technologies 
even if we were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
we also may be required to pay substantial damages to the patent holder in the event of an infringement 
under some circumstances in the united states  these damages could be triple the actual damages the patent holder incurs 
if we have supplied infringing products to third parties for marketing or licensed third parties to manufacture  use or market infringing products  we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses the third parties may sustain themselves as the result of lost sales or damages paid to the patent holder 
any successful infringement action brought against us may also adversely affect marketing of products based on our technologies in other markets not covered by the infringement action 
furthermore  we may suffer adverse consequences from a successful infringement action against us even if the action is subsequently reversed on appeal  nullified through another action or resolved by settlement with the patent holder 
the damages or other remedies awarded  if any  may be significant 
as a result  any infringement action against us would likely harm our competitive position  be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section summarizes significant factors affecting the company s consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity for the three year period ended june  this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we commercialize materials  products and production processes for the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets 
we manufacture for commercial sale thin film photovoltaic pv modules  which account for substantially all of our total revenues 
we also manufacture and sell positive electrode nickel hydroxide battery materials  and license our nickel metal hydride nimh battery technology  which is used in commercial products 
our principal joint ventures cobasys llc and ovonyx  inc are commercializing our nimh battery and ovonic universal memory oum technologies  respectively 
battery products manufactured by cobasys are commercially available 
these business activities represent application of our overall business strategy to commercialize our materials  products and production processes internally and through third party relationships  such as licenses and joint ventures 
accordingly  our results reflect our approach to commercialization of a particular technology  as well as the commercial readiness of that technology  and consideration should be given to the following key factors when reviewing our results for the periods discussed we are engaged in full scale manufacturing and sale of our pv products through our united solar ovonic segment  and our consolidated financial results are driven primarily by the performance of this segment 
our united solar ovonic segment accounted for of our total revenue in fiscal additionally  our united solar ovonic segment generated operating income of  in fiscal  while our other segment  ovonic materials  had an operating loss of  and our corporate activities  which includes corporate operating  general and administrative and patent expenses  had a net expense of approximately  both of which we have substantially reduced recently through the first phase of our restructuring plan  as discussed below 
given the expected growth of our photovoltaic business as discussed below relative to our other business activities  our overall success in the foreseeable future will be aligned primarily with the performance of our united solar ovonic segment and subject to the risks of that business 
we are rapidly expanding manufacturing capacity for our pv products to meet the rapid growth in the alternative energy generation market in general and the solar market in particular  and we will require significant capital to fund this expansion 
we doubled our manufacturing capacity in fiscal year to mw and are planning to double it again to approximately mw in fiscal year  as we rapidly expand to an expected capacity exceeding mw per annum by we are funding the initial phases of our manufacturing capacity expansion with the proceeds from our march common stock offering 
we will require additional funding for subsequent phases 
table of contents through  which we may obtain from equity or debt financing  business agreements and other sources 
we are aggressively pursuing cost reduction and efficiency improvement initiatives to enhance our competitiveness  as competition grows  and pricing pressures increase  in the solar market 
we and other pv module manufacturers are expanding pv module manufacturing capacity  and new manufacturers are initiating production  to meet the rapidly increasing global demand for pv systems 
this expansion is presently creating pricing pressures and resulting in historically higher inventories 
we are rapidly expanding our sales and marketing teams in the united states and europe to increase our sales to match our expanding production capacity 
we are also aggressively pursuing cost reduction and efficiency enhancement initiatives for our products and equipment to lower our pv module costs and overall pv systems costs 
these initiatives are expected to offset the pricing pressures in the near term and attain cost competitiveness with traditional energy sources in the longer term 
we are commercializing our nimh battery and oum technologies principally through unconsolidated joint ventures  and we account for our interests in these joint ventures under the equity method of accounting 
our principal joint ventures cobasys and ovonyx were founded upon technologies that we pioneered to further develop and commercialize these technologies 
in each case  we participate in the business as equity holders but do not directly manage or have a controlling interest in the entity 
we have not reported any earnings or losses from cobasys because our only contributions to cobasys have been noncash items  including intellectual property and know how 
we have contributed intellectual property and cash to ovonyx  and have reported losses up to our cash investment in ovonyx 
our interests in cobasys and ovonyx were recorded at zero and  respectively  on our balance sheet at june  we and our joint venture partner are exploring strategic alternatives for cobasys 
we and chevron have agreed to explore strategic alternatives regarding cobasys that are intended to provide cobasys funding to further capitalize on global opportunities for integrated energy storage solutions in the rapidly growing hybrid electric vehicle and stationary power industries 
this process is continuing  and the timing and nature of a particular strategic alternative to be consummated  if any  has not been concluded 
we are developing certain of our emerging technologies with the intent to bring these technologies to commercialization 
these development activities  which have historically generated losses  are being substantially reduced and balanced to sustainable levels as part of a restructuring plan 
we have successfully brought our pv and nimh technologies from pioneering technologies to commercial products  and ovonyx has been collaborating successfully with a number of semiconductor companies to commercialize oum 
we are utilizing a similar strategy for our current emerging technologies 
as part of the restructuring plan discussed below  these development activities are being substantially reduced and balanced with external sources of revenues  such as royalties  and development agreements including government contracts to realign commercialization efforts at sustainable levels 
additionally  we are seeking third party investments and are re evaluating our emerging technologies to ensure that they are properly prioritized with these goals 

table of contents key indicators of financial condition and operating performance 
in evaluating our business  we use product sales  operating income and cash flow from operations as key performance metrics 
we also use production  measured in megawatts mw per annum  as a key performance metric for our united solar ovonic segment  particularly in connection with the manufacturing expansion in this segment 
succession planning and restructuring plan 
we are undertaking a number of corporate initiatives as the company transitions from a product development company to a more commercially oriented  operations focused manufacturing environment 
we have developed and implemented an orderly succession plan for the company s management team 
mark d 
morelli will become our president and chief executive officer effective september   succeeding robert c 
stempel who will remain as nonexecutive chairman of ecd s board of directors and a member of the finance committee 
stanford r 
ovshinsky is retiring as active employee and director of the company effective august  in addition  in april  we began implementing an organizational restructuring to consolidate and realign our business activities and reduce costs 
the specific activities under the restructuring plan include consolidating the photovoltaic machine building activities into the united solar ovonic business segment  substantially reducing activities in the previous ovonic battery and ecd segments  rebalancing these activities with external revenue sources and consolidating the remaining activities into the new ovonic materials segment  and reducing general and administrative personnel and other costs 
the plan is expected to yield the following principal benefits reduce annual costs by approximately million when fully implemented by the end of fiscal year  strengthen our united solar ovonic segment by aligning all of the key components for photovoltaic operations within a single  unified operating structure to lower capital and production costs and drive technology improvements  align our emerging technologies with our business goals in our new ovonic materials segment  while directing integrated research and development and administrative resources accordingly  and right size and consolidate enterprise general and administrative activities to realize organizational synergies 
the first phase of activities under the plan  from which most of the annual cost savings will be realized  was substantially complete as of june   and the company incurred restructuring and other related charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal year of approximately million in connection with this phase 
additional charges are expected in fiscal year in connection with the second  and final  phase of the plan  which will be fully completed by the end of fiscal year as a result of the organizational restructuring  we are now reporting under two business segments united solar ovonic and ovonic materials and separately reporting our corporate activities 
the operating results in this report  including prior period results  reflect this new reporting structure

operating profit declined primarily due to the expected impact of the ramp up of the auburn hills manufacturing facility and preproduction expenses at our new manufacturing facilities 
the increase in revenues in was primarily attributable to an increase in the volume of pv product sales  partially offset by product and price mix 
product sales were significantly impacted by a temporary  substantial decline of sales during the first two quarters of fiscal year of our pv modules to solar integrated technologies inc  which we were unable to fully reallocate to existing customers or offset through additional sales 
gross profit margin on product sales decreased to in from in due to the expected impact of the ramp up and other costs related to our new auburn hills manufacturing facility and to lower prices 
as we expand our manufacturing capacity  our gross profit margins will be impacted by higher costs associated with production volumes as we ramp up production to full capacity at our new manufacturing facilities 
fiscal gross margins will be impacted by production ramp up at our greenville  michigan  tianjin  china and tijuana  mexico  facilities which are expected to be placed in service in late calendar and mid calendar year 

table of contents the combined product development and research expenses increased to  in from  in as a result of new development agreements in the increase in revenues from product development agreements is also attributable to these new agreements 
in addition  we continue to incur product development and research expenses to improve the throughput of our pv cell manufacturing equipment  reduce the cost of production and increase the sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of our pv modules 
preproduction costs increased due principally to increased expansion activities related to our new auburn hills manufacturing facility which was placed into service in december  and the construction of manufacturing facilities in greenville and in tijuana  mexico 
we will incur preproduction costs  consisting principally of training costs for new employees and facilities costs  with each new manufacturing facility until we commence manufacturing at the facility 
these costs are expected to be substantial as we continue to rapidly expand our manufacturing capacity from the current mw per annum to an expected capacity exceeding mw by the loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment represents the net book value of capital assets no longer needed  which were scrapped in operating  selling  general and administrative and patent expenses increased due principally to hiring of sales staff  particularly in europe  and support staff for expansion activities associated with our new auburn hills and greenville manufacturing facilities

certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
however  they are subject to an 
table of contents inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
stock based compensation effective july   ecd adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
this statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas no 
and supersedes apb no 
sfas no 
r requires that all stock based compensation be recognized as an expense in the financial statements and that such cost be measured at the fair value of the grant 
this statement was adopted using the modified prospective method of application  which requires us to recognize compensation expense on a prospective basis 
therefore  prior period financial statements have not been restated 
under this method  in addition to reflecting compensation expense for new share based grants  expense is also recognized to reflect the remaining service period of grants that had been included in pro forma disclosures in prior periods 
ecd records the fair value of stock based compensation grants as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  ecd applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
ecd uses an expected stock price volatility assumption that is based on historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which is obtained from public data sources 
with regard to the weighted average option life assumption  ecd considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
patterns are determined on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees 
forfeiture rates are based on the company s historical data for stock option forfeitures 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
r  ecd applied apb to its stock based compensation awards to employees 
had compensation costs for ecd s stock option plans been determined based upon the fair value at the grant date for awards under these plans consistent with the methodology prescribed under sfas no
