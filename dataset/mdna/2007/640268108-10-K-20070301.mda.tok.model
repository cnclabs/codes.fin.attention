item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section as well as in part i item a of this report under the heading risk factors 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company with a mission to develop breakthrough products that make a difference in patients lives 
we create differentiated  innovative products by applying our platform technologies to established or novel medicines 
our two leading technology platforms are pulmonary technology and pegylation technology 
nine products using these technology platforms have received regulatory approval in the us or the eu 
our two technology platforms are the basis of nearly all of the partnered and proprietary programs currently in preclinical and clinical development or being commercialized 
we create or enable potential products in two ways 
first  we develop products in collaboration with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that seek to improve and differentiate their products 
second  we apply our technologies to already approved drugs to create and develop our own differentiated  proprietary programs 
our proprietary programs are designed to target serious diseases in novel ways 
we believe our proprietary products and development programs have the potential to raise the standards of current patient care by improving one or more performance parameters including efficacy  safety and ease of use 
our technology platforms enable improved performance of a variety of new and existing molecules 
our pulmonary technology makes drugs inhaleable to deliver them to and through the lungs for both systemic and local lung applications 
our pegylation technology is a chemical process designed to enhance the performance of most drug classes with the potential to improve solubility and stability  increase drug half life  reduce immune responses to an active drug  and improve the efficacy or safety of a molecule in certain instances 
the commercial success of exubera will be a critical factor in us achieving our profitability objective and for us to be able to fund the key elements of our business strategy 
we expect our future revenues to come increasingly from the manufacture and sale of exubera inhalation powder and inhalers and royalties from sales of exubera by pfizer 
like any product in the early stages of commercial launch  there are substantial risks and uncertainties with respect to the commercial success of exubera  including the timing and success of the commercialization of exubera by pfizer in various markets  physician and patient education and experiences  third party payor reimbursement  country specific pricing approvals  manufacturing and supply execution  and other risks and uncertainties identified in this report 
in addition  under our collaboration agreement with pfizer  we do not participate in the marketing and sales activity for exubera 
our manufacturing revenues received from pfizer for exubera inhalation powder and inhalers are calculated on a cost plus basis 
exubera royalty revenue levels will depend on the level of exubera product sales to end users and pfizer s cost of goods sold for exubera 
pfizer is taking a phased approach to the exubera commercial launch 
in the second half of  the early phase of the exubera launch focused on manufacturing scale up activities and the education of diabetes specialists 
in  pfizer initiated the next phase of the launch expanding the education  marketing and sales efforts more broadly to primary care physicians 
because the exubera commercial roll out is in its early phases  we cannot predict the level of exubera end user product sales or expected royalty revenues for this or subsequent years 
currently  we are the exclusive manufacturer of the exubera inhalation powder 
under our collaboration agreement  pfizer can manufacture up to one half of the exubera inhalation powder and also has responsibility for the automated filling of all insulin blister packs for the exubera inhaler and packaging of the exubera 
table of contents product 
pfizer has an exubera inhalation powder manufacturing facility and will likely manufacture a portion of the exubera inhalation powder in the future 
in the second half of  pfizer experienced scale up challenges with highly automated  specially engineered pfizer equipment  although pfizer has said they made significant progress in addressing these challenges 
any failure  delay or inability to address these challenges and scale up pfizer s portion of the manufacturing  filling  and packaging processes could impede exubera sales and would significantly and adversely impact our revenues  results of operations  and financial condition 
although we have been successful at meeting our exubera inhalation powder and inhaler manufacturing objectives to date  it is critical that we continue to meet our manufacturing commitments in to support pfizer s requirements 
commercial scale manufacturing execution by both nektar and pfizer remains an important factor in meeting anticipated exubera market demand and meeting our financial objectives 
we continue to make significant investments in our proprietary development programs which comprise a substantial portion of our research and development spending 
our current strategy is to develop a portfolio of proprietary programs that is intended to address critical unmet medical needs by exploiting our know how and technology in combination with established medicines 
we intend to continue our strategy of partnering these development programs with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in various stages of their development in an effort to help fund the investment of our proprietary development programs 
our decision as to when to seek partners for our proprietary development programs will be made on an individual program basis and such decisions will have an important impact on our future revenues  research and development spending  and financial position 
in this regard  we are currently seeking collaboration partners for two of our proprietary development programs and the success and timing of these partnering efforts will affect our research and development expense levels and revenues in and beyond 
we will continue to seek collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
we believe our partnering strategy enables us to develop a large and diversified pipeline of products and development programs using our technologies 
to date the revenues we have received from the sales of our partner products have been insufficient to meet our operating and other expenses 
other than revenues we expect to generate from exubera  we do not anticipate receiving sufficient amounts of revenue from other partner product sales or royalties in the near future to meet our operating expenses 
to fund the expense related to our research and development activities  we have raised significant amounts of capital through the sale of our equity and convertible debt securities 
as of december   we had approximately million in long term debt 
our ability to meet the repayment obligations of this debt is dependent upon our and our partners ability to develop  obtain regulatory approvals  and successfully commercialize products 
even if we are successful in this regard  we may require additional capital to repay our debt obligations 
research and development activities our product pipeline includes both partnered and proprietary development programs 
we have ongoing collaborations or licensing arrangements with more than thirty biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies to provide our technologies 
our technologies are currently being used in nine approved products  in two partner programs that have been filed for with the fda and twelve development programs in human clinical trials 
the length of time that a development program is in a given phase varies substantially according to factors relating to the development program  such as the type and intended use of the potential product  the clinical trial design  and the ability to enroll suitable patients 
generally  for partnered programs  advancement from one phase to the next and the related costs to do so is dependent upon factors that are primarily controlled by our partners 
our portfolio of development programs is focused on our pulmonary technology and pegylation technology platforms 
within each major category  we have both partnered and proprietary development programs 
the

no other single customer represented or more of our total revenues for any of the three years ended december   or product sales and royalties the increase in product sales and royalties for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to an increase in exubera product sales to pfizer after the approval of exubera in january also contributing to the increase was approximately million from our pegylation products 
the increase in product sales and royalty revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december   was due primarily to million of royalty revenue received from osi pharmaceuticals formerly eyetech pharmaceuticals product sales of macugen  million of exubera product sales  and million of product sales for aerogen products received in the year ended december  these product sales and royalty revenue increases were partially offset by decreases of million of product sales from our pegylation technology customers 
we have not experienced any significant returns from our customers 
royalty revenues were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
contract research contract research revenue includes reimbursed research and development expenses as well as the amortization of deferred up front signing and milestone payments received from our collaborative partners 
contract research revenue is expected to fluctuate from year to year  and future contract research revenue cannot be predicted accurately 
the level of contract research revenues depends in part upon the continuation of existing collaborations  signing of new collaborations  and achievement of milestones under current and future agreements 

table of contents the decrease in contract research revenue in compared to was primarily due to a million decrease in pfizer contract research revenue after the fda and emea approval of exubera in january  and the transition from contract research revenue and commercialization readiness revenue from pfizer for the exubera development program to exubera product sales 
the decrease in contract research revenue from pfizer was partially offset by a million increase in contract research revenues from novartis pharma ag formerly chiron corporation under our collaboration agreement to develop a dry powder inhaled formation of tobramycin using our pulmonary technology and a million increase in contract research revenue from baxter healthcare  under our agreement to develop a product to extend the half life of hemophilia a proteins using our pegylation technology 
the decrease in contract research revenue for compared to was primarily due to approximately million decrease in revenue from pfizer related to the transition of the exubera program from contract research and development to commercialization readiness 
in addition  during the year ended december   we recognized million in revenue from a one time payment related to aventis termination of a collaborative program with us 
other decreases were primarily due to the expected fluctuations in contract research revenue and the timing of milestone payments

cost of goods sold in thousands except percentages years ended december  increase decrease vs increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs cost of goods sold product gross margin product gross margin the increase in cost of goods sold during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  is due to increased exubera product sales 
this resulted in an increase in gross margin percentage because the exubera inhalation powder and inhalers have a relatively higher margin than our other products 
we expect the gross margin percentage to decline in future periods due to product mix and our cost plus manufacturing arrangement 
cost of sales for the years ended december   and includes million  nil and nil  respectively  of stock based compensation 
the decrease in product gross margin percentage for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   was primarily due to million of exubera product sales at zero margin

table of contents powder manufacturing facilities and our exubera inhaler third party contract manufacturing locations 
the decrease in exubera commercialization readiness revenue was primarily due to the transition from readiness preparation to commercial production in late and early exubera commercialization readiness costs are start up manufacturing costs we have incurred in our exubera inhalation powder manufacturing facility and our exubera inhaler device third party contract manufacturing locations preparing for commercial scale manufacturing 
we do not anticipate incurring any additional costs related to commercialization readiness 
we expect that remaining commercialization readiness costs previously incurred will be amortized through october research and development in thousands except percentages years ended december  increase decrease vs increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs research development purchased in process research and development    n a n a the decrease in the research and development expense from the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   related to decreased spending in our inhaled insulin programs of million and other programs of million 
these decreases were partially offset by million of non cash stock based compensation expense attributable to the adoption of sfas r and million related to our pegylation programs 
the increase in research and development expense for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   was primarily attributable to an increase of million for pulmonary programs  million for pegylation programs and million in other programs 
during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million for purchased in process research and development costs in connection with our acquisition of aerogen 
the purchased in process research and development costs were expensed on the acquisition date because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative use outside of these development programs 
the in process research and development primarily represents two programs in clinical development  amikacin and surfactant 
amikacin is used in our inhaled antibiotic program in an aerosolized form 
we have completed one phase trial and are currently planning phase studies to examine the pharmacokinetics of the program

the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the following increased salary and employee benefit costs of million  including million of stock based compensation expense  of which million is related to executive severance  million of cash 
table of contents compensation  of which million is due to executive severance  and million of employee health and welfare benefits 
increased professional fees of million primarily due to legal services related to litigation support  audit and related services  and other consulting services 
increased lease termination costs of million associated with the winding down of operations of bradford uk 
the increase from lease termination costs was partially offset by lack of general and administrative costs due to the wind down of our bradford operations 
the increase in general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  was primarily due to the following increased accounting fees and expenses of approximately million  primarily due to sarbanes oxley compliance requirements 
increased legal fees and expenses of approximately million  primarily due to increased patent fees related to our proprietary development programs and derivative shareholder claims 
incremental headcount and related expenses of million to support our product planning and marketing efforts for our proprietary and partnered programs 
addition of approximately million from aerogen operations from the date of acquisition through december  we expect general and administrative spending to increase over the next few years to support increased commercial activities 
litigation settlement years ended december  increase decrease vs increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs litigation settlement n a on june   we  our subsidiary nektar therapeutics al nektar al  and a former officer  milton harris  entered into a settlement agreement and general release settlement agreement with the university of alabama huntsville uah related to an intellectual property dispute 
under the terms of the settlement agreement  the company  nektar al  mr 
harris and uah agreed to full and complete satisfaction of all claims asserted in the litigation in exchange for million in cash payments 
we and mr 
harris made an initial payment of million on june   of which we paid million and mr 
harris paid million 
beginning july   we will pay uah ten annual installment payments of million each  representing an accrued liability of million at december  or the present value of the future payments using an annual discount rate 
we recorded a litigation settlement charge of million during the year ended december  which reflects the net present value of the settlement payments 
amortization of other intangible assets in thousands except percentages years ended december  increase decrease vs increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs amortization of other intangible assets 
table of contents other intangible assets include proprietary technology  intellectual property  and supplier and customer relationships acquired from third parties or in business combinations 
the majority of our other intangible assets were either impaired or fully amortized as of the year ending december  as of december   the net book value of our other intangible assets is million representing the unamortized portion of our supplier and customer relationships intangible asset 
this will be amortized on a straight line basis of approximately million per year through october accordingly  we expect our amortization of other intangible assets to decrease to million per year in the future  absent additional business combinations 
impairment of long lived assets in thousands except percentages years ended december  increase decrease vs increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs impairment of long lived assets n a for the year ending december   impairment of long lived assets includes million relating to the write off of certain intangible assets relating to our ireland operations 
additionally  as a result of a contract renegotiation with one of our collaboration partners  we determined that costs incurred relating to a construction in progress asset had no future value because the asset is no longer probable of being completed 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million 
also  as a result of the winding down of our bradford uk operations  we recorded an impairment charge of million relating to the remaining laboratory and office equipment 
we performed our annual impairment test for goodwill in october and determined at that time that the undiscounted cash flow from our long range forecast for each respective business unit exceeded the carrying amount of the respective goodwill 
in december  we were apprised of unfavorable results of clinical data related to programs from our super critical fluids technology program in bradford uk  which provided an indication that the fair value of the respective business unit s goodwill was below the carrying value 
therefore  in connection with our year end close process  we re performed the impairment analysis of goodwill and other long lived assets for bradford uk 
we determined the fair value of the intangibles and other assets of nektar uk based on a discounted cash flow model to be less than the carrying amount of goodwill and certain long lived assets 
based on the above  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill and long lived assets in the year ended december  in the amount of million and million  respectively 
this charge is reflected in the impairment of long lived assets line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
see note for more information regarding the winding down of the bradford facility

the net increase of million was primarily due to the interest expense related to the issuance of million of convertible subordinated notes in september less the decrease in interest expense related to the retirement of million and million aggregate principle amount of our outstanding and convertible subordinate notes due february   and october   respectively  in september other income expense  net in thousands except percentages years ended december  increase decrease vs increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs other income expense  net during the year ended december   we recognized a million gain from the sale of an equity investment in confluent technologies 
we do not expect to realize income from such transactions in the future 
other expense  net of the gain from the sale of our investment in confluent technologies is million and is primarily related to net foreign exchange gains and losses 
during the year ended december   we terminated our lease obligation related to  square feet of space located at our headquarters in san carlos  california 
we recorded other expense of approximately million  representing the write off of our capital lease asset partially offset by a reduction in the present value of our future rent liability 
in addition  other income for the year ended december   included million of income related to our real estate partnership which was dissolved in september loss on debt extinguishment in thousands except percentages years ended december  increase decrease vs increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs percentage increase decrease vs loss on debt extinguishment   n a 
table of contents during the year ended december   we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately million in connection with the retirement of million and million aggregate principle amount of our outstanding and convertible subordinated notes due february and october  respectively for total cash payments of million  in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result these transactions  we wrote off approximately million and million of capitalized debt issuance costs related to the and convertible subordinated notes  respectively 
during the year ended december   we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment in connection with two privately negotiated transactions to convert our outstanding convertible subordinated notes into shares of our common stock 
in january  certain holders of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due october completed an exchange and cancellation of million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for the issuance of million shares of our common stock 
in february  certain holders of our outstanding convertible subordinated notes due june converted approximately million in aggregate principal amount of such notes for approximately million shares of our common stock and a cash payment of approximately million 
as a result of these transactions  we recognized losses on debt extinguishment of approximately million and million  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and investments in marketable securities of million and indebtedness of million  including million of convertible subordinated notes  million in capital lease obligations and million in other long term liabilities as of december  we have financed our operations primarily through revenue from product sales and research and development contracts  public and private placements of debt and equity securities and financing of equipment acquisitions and certain tenant leasehold improvements 
we do not utilize off balance sheet financing arrangements as a source of liquidity or financing 
cashflow activities during the year ended december   we used approximately million in operating cash flows 
to date  revenue has not been sufficient to cover our expenses and we are not generating positive cash flow through our operations 
cash used in operating activities included an million cash payment made in connection with the university of alabama huntsville litigation settlement 
in  we also purchased million of property and equipment and repaid million in debt obligations 
these uses of cash were partially offset by million in cash collected from employees for the purchase of common stock 
during the year ended december   we used million in operating cashflows 
we purchased million of property and equipment and spent million for the purchase of aerogen  inc additionally  we repaid million in debt obligations 
these uses of cash were offset by million in proceeds from the issuance  net of repurchases  of convertible subordinated notes  as well as proceeds from the issuance of common stock to employees and a secondary offering of million and million  respectively 
we expect to use a substantial portion of our cash to fund our on going operations over the next few years and to repay our million of indebtedness outstanding as of december   including million of convertible subordinated notes due in in february  we repaid million of our convertible subordinated notes with cash 

table of contents contractual obligations the following is a summary of our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period total yr yrs yrs obligations convertible subordinated notes  including interest capital leases  including interest operating leases purchase commitments litigation settlement and other long term liabilities  including interest the above table does not include certain commitments and contingencies which are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we repaid million of the convertible subordinated notes on february  substantially all of this amount had been ordered on open purchase orders as of december  under existing contracts with the company 
this amount does not represent minimum contract termination liability 
given our current cash requirements  we forecast that we will have sufficient cash to meet our net operating expense requirements and contractual obligations through we plan to continue to invest in our growth and our future cash requirements will depend upon the timing of these investments 
our capital needs will depend on many factors  including continued progress in our research and development programs  progress with preclinical and clinical trials of our proprietary and partnered product candidates  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs of developing and scaling our clinical and commercial manufacturing operations  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining and enforcing patent claims  the need to acquire licenses to new technologies and the status of competitive products 
to date we have been primarily dependent upon equity and convertible debt financings for capital and have incurred substantial debt as a result of our issuances of subordinated notes that are convertible into our common stock 
our substantial debt  the market price of our securities  and the general economic climate  among other factors  could have material consequences for our financial position and could affect our sources of short term and long term funding 
there can be no assurance that additional funds  if and when required  will be available to us on favorable terms  if at all 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  and evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have determined that for the periods reported in this report  the following accounting policies and estimates are critical in understanding our financial condition and results of our operations 

table of contents revenue recognition product revenues from exubera inhalation powder and inhalers are primarily derived from the cost plus manufacturing and supply agreement with pfizer  are subject to quarterly manufacturing variance adjustments  and are recognized at the earlier of acceptance of products by pfizer or sixty days from shipment 
under generally accepted accounting principles  revenue should be recognized when the related revenue is fixed and determinable 
under contracts such as the pfizer contract  where the right of return exists  management must make a determination whether to estimate returns based on historical activity or to defer recognition of revenue until the contractual right of return period has lapsed 
because commercial activities began in  we did not have historical return data to use as a basis for product returns 
to date  pfizer has not returned any exubera inhalation powder or inhalers 
product revenues and the related cost of goods sold for products that were shipped to pfizer but have not been recognized within sixty days are recorded as deferred revenue  net of the deferred costs 
as of december   we had net deferred margin relating to exubera sales of million  comprised of million of deferred revenue and million of deferred cost of sales 
in the future  in lieu of deferring all revenue and related cost of sales  we expect to recognize revenue upon shipment of goods to pfizer  net of a reserve for estimated product returns 
we will make this change when we are able to reasonably estimate returns based on historical return experience and other factors 
contract research revenue includes amortization of up front fees 
up front fees should be recognized ratably over the expected benefit period under the arrangement 
given the uncertainties of research and development collaborations  significant judgment is required to determine the duration of the arrangement 
we have million of deferred up front fees related to two research and collaboration agreements that are being amortized over an average of years 
we considered shorter and longer amortization periods 
the shortest reasonable period is the end of the development period estimated to be to years 
given the statistical probability of drug development success in the bio pharma industry  development programs have only a probability of reaching commercial success 
the longest period is either the contractual life of the agreement  which is generally years from the first commercial sale  or the end of the patent life  which is frequently years 
if we had determined a longer or shorter amortization period was appropriate  our annual up front fee amortization could be as low as million or as high as million 
milestone payments received are deferred and recorded as revenue ratably over the next period of continued development 
management makes its best estimate of the period of time until the next milestone is reached 
this estimate affects the recognition of revenue for completion of the previous milestone 
the original estimate is periodically evaluated to determine if circumstances have caused the estimate to change and if so  amortization of revenue is adjusted prospectively 
stock based compensation during  we issued rsu awards totaling  shares of our common stock to certain employees and directors 
the rsu awards are settled by delivery of shares of our common stock on or shortly after the date the awards vest 
a significant portion of these awards vest base upon achieving three pre determined performance milestones which were initially expected to occur over a period of months 
we are expensing the grant date fair value of the awards ratably over the expected performance period 
during the period ended september  management determined that one of the milestones  representing of the total awards  was no longer probable as defined in sfas no 
accounting for contingencies of vesting 
as a result  we reversed all previously recorded compensation expense related to this performance milestone  or approximately million 
if we had determined that this milestone was probable  we would have expensed an additional million during the year ended december  the remaining of the performance based rsus are expected to vest over a month period from the award date 
we recorded compensation expense of million in the year ended december  related to the remaining of these performance based rsu awards 

table of contents impairment of goodwill and other long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually or on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
goodwill is tested for impairment using a two step approach 
the first step is to compare our fair value to our net asset value  including goodwill 
if the fair value of net assets is greater than our book value of net assets  goodwill is not considered impaired and the second step is not required 
if the fair value is less than our net asset value  the second step of the impairment test measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the impairment test is to compare the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment loss is recognized equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated in the same manner that goodwill is calculated in a business combination  whereby the fair value is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities including any unrecognized intangible assets as if they had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price 
the excess purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities would be the implied fair value of goodwill 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform a test for recoverability of our intangible and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized only if the carrying amount of an intangible or long lived asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposal of the asset 
in december  we were apprised of unfavorable results at our bradford  uk facility and certain clinical data related to those activities 
we re performed our annual impairment test of the goodwill assigned to the super critical fluids reporting unit 
we determined the fair value of the super critical fluids reporting unit  based on a discounted cash flow analysis  was less than the carrying amount of the reporting units assets  including assigned goodwill 
consequently  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the year ended december  in connection with this impairment  we also impaired certain equipment used at the bradford location resulting an additional charge of million 
these charges are reflected in the impairment of long lived assets line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding the winding down of the bradford facility 
during the second half of  we began a process of evaluating business activities outside our focus areas of pulmonary technology and pegylation technology 
in late december  we entered into a non binding letter of intent to sell our nebulizer device business 
we determined that the non binding letter of intent to sell the nebulizer device business  coupled with our general efforts to focus on core technologies  were indicators that our intangible asset related to these products acquired from the aerogen acquisition does not have future value 
after reassessing the remaining useful life of this intangible asset and evaluating the historical net losses from the nebulizer device business  we determined the intangible asset was fully impaired and recorded a million charge for the year ended december  this charge is reflected in the impairment of long lived assets line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas no 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
this statement is effective beginning in october we are evaluating whether adoption of this statement will result in a change to its fair value measurements

we do not expect the adoption of the statement to have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
fin in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
this interpretation  among other things  creates a two step approach for evaluating uncertain tax positions 
recognition occurs when an enterprise concludes that a tax position  based on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination 
measurement determines the amount of benefit that more likely than not will be realized 
de recognition of a tax position that was previously recognized would occur when a company subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
fin specifically prohibits the use of a valuation allowance as a substitute for de recognition of tax positions  and it has expanded disclosure requirements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   in which the impact of adoption should be accounted for as a cumulative effect adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings 
we believe adoption of this pronouncement will not impact our financial position  results of operation or cash flows due to our history of net losses and fully reserved deferred tax assets  however we are still evaluating fin and have not yet determined the impact the adoption will have on the our tax disclosures in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid and high quality debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and maintain a weighted average maturity of one year or less 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate million decrease  less than  in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  this potential change is based on sensitivity analyses performed on our investment securities at december  actual results may differ materially 
the same hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an approximate million decrease  less than  in the fair value of our available for sale securities at december  foreign currency risk our operations include research and development  manufacturing  sales and purchasing activities in the us and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or economic conditions in the foreign markets in which we have exposure 
our results of operations are exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and various foreign currencies  most significantly the british pound and euro
