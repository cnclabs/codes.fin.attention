item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for discussion of current market conditions 
we operate vessels in six principal geographic regions 
from time to time  vessels are relocated between these regions to meet customer demand for equipment 
the table below sets forth vessel types by geographic market as of december we sometimes participate in joint venture arrangements in certain geographical locations in order to enhance our marketing capabilities and facilitate operations in certain foreign markets 
this allows for expansion of both our fleet and operations while diversifying risks and reducing capital outlays associated with such expansion

at december   vessels were operating in the us  including owned  leased in  one joint ventured and one pooled 
offshore marine services expertise in this market is deepwater anchor handling with our fleet of ahts vessels and exploration and production support with our fleet of crew and mini supply vessels 
this is a highly volatile market because the activities we support tend to be of short term duration and influenced by the near term price of natural gas 
in addition  a large number of offshore marine service companies are active in this market and they compete largely on price alone 
africa  primarily west africa 
at december   vessels were operating in west africa  including owned and five bareboat chartered in 
our largest market in this area is nigeria  which is dominated by the major oil companies and is characterized by large scale  multi year projects 
angola is an increasingly significant market for our business 
at the end of the year  we had eleven vessels operating within angolan waters 
the remainder of the company s vessels in this region operate from ports in the republic of the congo  cameroon  gabon  equatorial guinea and south africa 
united kingdom  primarily north sea 
at december   vessels were operating in the north sea  including owned  one joint ventured and five managed in 
the north sea fleet provides standby safety and supply services 
demand in the north sea market for standby services developed in after the united kingdom promulgated legislation requiring offshore operations to maintain higher specification standby safety vessels 
the legislation requires a vessel to stand by to provide a means of evacuation and rescue for platform and rig personnel in the event of an emergency at an offshore installation 
asia 
at december   vessels were operating in asia  including eleven owned  two leased in and two joint ventured 
offshore marine services vessels operating in this area generally support exploration programs and therefore follow drilling rigs to their locations in the region 
to date  our largest markets in this area have been vietnam and indonesia 
we compete against a large number of local and international companies in this region 
middle east 
at december   vessels were operating in the middle east region  including owned and eight joint ventured 
offshore marine services vessels operating in this area generally support activities in countries along the arabian gulf and arabian sea  including the united arab emirates  qatar  pakistan and india 
we compete against a large number of local and international companies in this region 
mexico  central and south america 
at december   vessels were operating in mexico  central and south america  including six owned and five joint ventured 
offshore marine services primary markets in this region are mexico and brazil 
in both areas  offshore marine services operates through local companies registered to do business in the country and benefits from certain national flag preferences 
customers and contractual arrangements offshore marine services principal customers are major integrated oil companies  large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies and emerging independent companies 
consolidation of oil and gas companies through mergers and acquisitions over the past several years has had a limiting effect on offshore marine services customer base 
in there was no single customer responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues 
the ten largest customers of offshore marine services accounted for approximately of offshore marine services operating revenues 
the loss of one or a few of our customers could have a material adverse effect on offshore marine services results of operations 
the offshore marine services segment earns and recognizes revenues primarily from the time charter and bareboat charter of vessels to customers based upon daily rates of hire 
a time charter is a lease arrangement under which the company provides a vessel to a customer and is responsible for all operating expenses  typically excluding fuel 
under bareboat charter agreements  the company provides the vessel to the customer and the customer assumes responsibility for all operating expenses and assumes all risk of operation 
vessel charters may range from several days to several years 
revenues from time charters and bareboat charters are recorded and recognized as service is provided 
competitive conditions each of the markets in which offshore marine services operates is highly competitive 
the most important competitive factors are pricing and the availability of equipment to fit customer requirements at the time the equipment is needed 
other important factors include service and reputation  flag preference  local marine operating conditions  the ability to provide and maintain logistical support given the complexity of a project and the cost of moving equipment from one geographical location to another 
offshore marine services has numerous competitors in each of its geographical regions ranging from international companies that operate vessels in many of the same regions to smaller local companies that typically concentrate their activities in one specific region 
risks of foreign operations for the years ended december   and approximately   and  respectively  of offshore marine services operating revenues were derived from foreign operations 
foreign operations are subject to inherent risks 
these risks include  among others  political instability  asset seizures  nationalization of assets  terrorist attacks  piracy  kidnapping  fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages  controls on currency exchange  the repatriation of income or capital  import export quotas and other forms of public and governmental regulation  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
it is not possible to predict whether any of these conditions or events might develop in the future 
the occurrence of any one or more of such conditions or events could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
marine transportation services business as of december   marine transportation services operated a fleet of ten us flag tankers  including nine owned and one leased in  providing marine transportation services for petroleum products and chemicals moving in the us domestic or coastwise trade 
additionally  marine transportation services managed one vessel on behalf of a third party 
this segment contributed and of consolidated revenues in and  respectively 
equipment and services the oil pollution act of opa prohibits vessels without double hulls from transporting crude oil and petroleum products in us coastwise transportation after certain dates based on the age and size of the vessel 
in addition  single hulled vessels will be prohibited from transporting petroleum products in most international markets under a phase out schedule established by the international maritime organization imo 
the table below sets forth our marine transportation services fleet as of december  name of vessel capacity in barrels tonnage in dwt opa retirement date type seabulk trader see note double bottom seabulk challenge see note double bottom hmi brenton reef none double hull seabulk energy none double hull seabulk arctic none double hull seabulk mariner none double hull seabulk pride none double hull seabulk power single hull seabulk magnachem double bottom seabulk america double bottom dead weight tons or dwt 
during marine transportation services committed to retrofit the seabulk trader and the seabulk challenge with double hulls  thereby enabling these vessels to continue to transport crude oil and petroleum products beyond their presently mandated opa retirement dates in work on the seabulk trader is expected to be completed during march work on the seabulk challenge is expected to begin during march and be completed by the end of june in marine transportation services exercised an option to purchase the seabulk magnachem at the expiration of the current lease term in february markets petroleum product transportation 
in the domestic energy trade  oceangoing vessels transport fuel and other petroleum products primarily from refineries and storage facilities along the coast of the us gulf of mexico to utilities  waterfront industrial facilities and distribution facilities along the us gulf of mexico  the atlantic and pacific coasts  as well as transport crude and product between alaska and the west coast and hawaii 
the number of us flag oceangoing vessels eligible to participate in the us domestic trade and capable of transporting fuel or petroleum products has steadily decreased since as vessels have reached the end of their useful lives or are being retired due to opa requirements 
in addition  the cost of new vessel construction in the united states a requirement to operate in the us domestic coastwise trade has substantially increased 
chemical transportation 
in the us domestic coastwise chemical transportation trade  vessels carry chemicals  primarily from chemical manufacturing plants and storage facilities along the coast of the us gulf of mexico to industrial users in and around us atlantic and pacific coast ports 
the chemicals transported consist primarily of caustic soda  paraxylene  alkylates  toluene and lubricating oils 
some of the chemicals must be carried in vessels with specially coated or stainless steel cargo tanks and many of them are sensitive to contamination and require special cargo handling equipment 
customers and contractual arrangements the primary purchasers of petroleum product transportation services are multi national oil and gas companies  oil trading companies and large industrial consumers of fuel with waterfront facilities 
the primary purchasers of chemical transportation services are chemical and oil companies 
both services are generally contracted for on the basis of short term or long term time charters  voyage charters  contracts of affreightment or other transportation agreements tailored to the shipper s requirements 
in  no single customer responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues 
the ten largest customers of marine transportation services accounted for approximately of marine transportation services operating revenues 
the loss of one or a few of our customers could have a material adverse effect on marine transportation services results of operations 
as with other vessels we operate  tankers operated by marine transportation services under time charter are operated for a daily rate of hire whereby the customer pays for fuel and we are responsible for the actual operation of the vessel and all other vessel operating expenses 
contracts of affreightment are contracts for cargos that are committed on a multi voyage basis over a period of weeks or months  with minimum and maximum cargo tonnages specified over the period at a fixed or escalating rate per ton 
revenues for voyage charters and contracts of affreightment are recognized based on the percentage of voyage completion computed on the basis of the number of voyage days worked at the relevant reporting date divided by the total number of days expected to complete the entire voyage 
competitive conditions the markets in which our fleet operate are highly competitive 
our primary direct competitors are other operators of us flag ocean going tank vessels and chemical carriers 
the most important competitive factors are pricing and availability to fit customer requirements as well as the requirement in certain areas to operate double hull or double bottom vessels 
inland river services business inland river services provides dry and liquid bulk cargo transportation on the us inland waterways  primarily the mississippi river  illinois river  tennessee river  ohio river and their tributaries and the us gulf intracoastal waterways 
we control one of the industry s newest fleets of dry cargo and tank barges transporting agricultural and industrial products on the inland waterways 
we also own towboats used for moving barges  a fleeting operation and deck barges for specialized projects 
inland river services contributed  and of consolidated operating revenues in  and  respectively 
equipment and services the following table sets forth the number of dry cargo barges  chemical tank barges  deck barges and towboats owned and or operated by inland river services 
owned joint ventured chartered in pooled or managed total dry cargo barges open dry cargo barges covered chemical tank barges deck barges towboats dry cargo barges open dry cargo barges covered chemical tank barges deck barges towboats dry cargo barges open dry cargo barges covered chemical tank barges deck barges towboats the inland river services dry cargo fleet consists of open and covered hopper barges 
open hopper barges are used to transport commodities that are not sensitive to water such as coal  aggregate and scrap 
covered hopper barges are more versatile because they can also carry water sensitive products  such as grain  ores  alloys  cements and fertilizer 
each dry cargo barge in our fleet is capable of transporting approximately  to  tons  to  metric tons of cargo 
the carrying capacity of a barge at any particular time is determined by water depth in the river channels and hull size of the barge 
adverse river conditions such as high water resulting from excessive rainfall  or low water caused by drought  can also impact operations by limiting the speed at which tows travel the us inland waterways  the number of barges included in tows and the quantity of cargo that is loaded in the barges 
inland barges are unmanned and are moved on the us inland waterways by vessels known in the trade as towboats 
the combination of a towboat and barges is commonly referred to as a tow 
we generally charge a price per ton for point to point transportation of dry bulk commodities 
customers are permitted a specified number of days to load and discharge the cargo  and thereafter pay a per diem rate for extra time 
from time to time  a small number of our dry cargo barges will be used for storage for a period prior to delivery 
inland river services contracts with third parties to provide towing services to move its dry cargo barges on a spot basis with rates charged being market driven 
towing prices fluctuate with demand  rising with higher volumes and higher fuel costs 
typical dry cargo voyage activity requires shifting a clean  empty barge from a fleeting location to a loading facility 
the barge is then moved from the loading location and assembled into a tow before proceeding to its next destination 
after unloading it is shifted to a fleeting area for cleaning and repair  if needed  before being moved again into a load position 
generally we try to match up northbound and southbound movements of cargo to minimize repositioning costs 
typically  grain cargos move southbound and non grain cargos move northbound 
the inland river services fleet of chemical and product tank barges transports liquid bulk cargos such as lube oils  solvents and glycols 
the operation and chartering arrangements for these barges are similar to those of the dry cargo barges described above 
inland river services also owns a fleeting operation which is a staging area for grouping barges in preparation for movements up and down the river and a holding area for barges waiting to load and unload cargo 
our fleeting operation is managed by a third party 
during the fourth quarter of  we entered into a joint venture with a financial investor to own a fleet of inland marine transportation assets with a view toward generating cash returns which may be enhanced by entering strategic positions in marketable securities and commodity futures 
during the fourth quarter of  we purchased a interest in a joint venture that operates a grain and liquid fertilizer storage and handling facility in mcleansboro  illinois 
markets the market for our services  prices achieved and utilization are driven by supply and demand economics 
the relationship between supply and demand reflects many factors  including the level of domestic and international production of the basic agricultural products to be transported in particular the yields from grain harvests the level of domestic and international consumption of agricultural products and the effect of these levels on the volumes of products that are physically moved into the export markets domestic and worldwide demand for iron ore  steel  steel by products  coal  petroleum and other bulk commodities strength or weakness of the us dollar the cost of ocean freight and the cost of fuel within the us other local factors also have an effect on pricing  including the supply of barges available to move the products the ability to position the barges to maximize efficiencies and utility in moving cargos both northbound and southbound the cost of alternative forms of transportation primarily rail general operating logistics on the river network including size and operating status of locks and dams the effect of river levels on the loading capacities of the barges in terms of draft restrictions most of inland river services business is booked in the short term and spot markets  and therefore  its earnings are subject to fluctuations in market rates 
we occasionally seek to enter into long term contracts to provide a level of stable cash flows and moderate the effect of market fluctuations 
seasonality during harsh winters the upper mississippi river usually closes to barge traffic from mid december to mid march 
ice often hinders the navigation of barge traffic on the mid mississippi river  the illinois river and the upper ohio river during the same period 
the volume of grain transported from the midwest to the gulf of mexico  which is primarily for export  is greatest during the harvest season from mid august through late november 
the harvest season is particularly significant because pricing tends to peak during these months in response to higher demand for equipment 
customers and contractual arrangements the principal customers for inland river services are major agricultural and industrial companies 
in there was no single customer responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues 
the ten largest customers of inland river services accounted for approximately of inland river services revenues in the loss of one or a few of our customers would not have a material adverse effect on inland river services results of operations 
most of the barges in the fleet are employed under contracts of affreightment that can vary in duration  ranging from one voyage to several years 
for longer term contracts base rates may be adjusted in response to changes in fuel prices and operating expenses 
some longer term contracts provide for the transport of a minimum number of tons of cargo or specific transportation requirements for a particular customer 
some barges are bareboat chartered out to third parties for a fixed payment of hire per day for the duration of the charter 
these contracts tend to be longer  ranging in term from one to five years 
competitive conditions generally  we believe the primary barriers to effective competitive entry into the us inland waterways markets are the complexity of operations  the consolidation of the inland river towing industry and the difficulty in assembling a large enough fleet and an experienced staff to operate efficiently in the execution of voyages and to re position barges effectively to optimize their use 
the primary competitive factors among established operators are price and availability of barges 
in addition to reliability  barge operators must have equipment of a suitable type and condition for a specific cargo 
we believe that there are four major domestic companies that operate over  barges each  with one of those operating over  barges 
there are also four mid sized barge companies that operate more than but less than  barges 
while our main competitors are other barge lines  railroads also compete for traffic that might otherwise move on the us inland waterways 
aviation services business aviation services helicopter fleet principally provides transportation services to the offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production industry that operates in the us gulf of mexico and alaska 
aviation services also provides flightseeing tours in alaska and leases helicopters to third parties 
it also owns a fixed base operation fbo at ted stevens anchorage international airport 
the fbo sells fuel and provides services to corporate aircraft and a regional airline 
aviation services contributed  and of consolidated operating revenues in  and  respectively 
equipment and services at december   aviation services owned helicopters and leased others under operating leases 
of these  were located in the united states and were located in foreign jurisdictions 
aviation services operates a federal aviation administration faa approved maintenance repair station in lake charles  louisiana and is a factory approved service facility for bell helicopter  american eurocopter and turbomeca 
the composition of aviation services fleet as of december was as follows owned a leased in managed total light helicopters medium helicopters heavy helicopters light helicopters medium helicopters heavy helicopters light helicopters medium helicopters heavy helicopters a excludes  and helicopters removed from service as of december   and  respectively light helicopters are single or twin engine helicopters with a passenger capacity of between four and seven 
medium helicopters are twin engine helicopters with a passenger capacity of up to heavy helicopters are twin engine helicopters with a passenger capacity of up to on january   a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  eramed llc eramed  acquired the air medical business of keystone helicopter corporation 
eramed operates light and medium twin engine aircraft  including four owned  ten leased in and managed  in support of hospital based air medical programs in the northeastern united states 
markets at this time  aviation services principal market for its transportation services is in the us gulf of mexico supporting the offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production industry 
the customers and locations are similar to those serviced by offshore marine services and the market opportunities there are subject to the same cycles and pressures as described in item business offshore marine services markets 
in addition  aviation services leases aircraft in the us and internationally  conducts flightseeing operations in alaska and provides services to the utility and offshore markets in alaska 
flightseeing services are operated out of juneau and from areas near denali national park 
other helicopter services to the oil and mining industries in alaska are provided on a contract or charter basis from bases in valdez  anchorage  the kenai area and deadhorse 
these services are somewhat seasonal in nature  peaking during the months of may through september when weather conditions are more conducive to operations 
seasonality a significant portion of aviation services operating revenues and profits related to oil and gas industry activity is dependent on actual flight hours 
the fall and winter months have fewer hours of daylight and consequently flight hours are generally lower at these times 
in addition  prolonged periods of adverse weather and the effect of fewer hours of daylight can adversely impact our operating results 
in general  the winter months of december through february in the us gulf of mexico and october through april in alaska have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year 
in the us gulf of mexico  june through november is tropical storm season 
during tropical storms  we are unable to operate in the area of the storm although flight activity may increase immediately prior to and after storms due to the evacuation and return of offshore workers 
our flightseeing operation is also seasonal  activity generally occurs from late may until early september 
customers and contractual arrangements aviation services charters its helicopters to utility and oil and gas customers primarily through master service agreements  term contracts and day to day charter arrangements 
master service agreements require incremental payments above a fixed fee based upon flight hours flown  have fixed terms ranging from one month to five years and generally are cancelable upon days notice 
term contracts and day to day charter arrangements are generally non cancelable without cause and call for a combination of a monthly or daily fixed rental fee plus a charge based on hours flown 
day to day charter arrangements are generally based on either an hourly or daily rate 
our rate structure  as it applies to our utility and oil and gas contracts  contains terms that limit our exposure to increases in fuel costs over a pre agreed level 
fuel costs in excess of these levels are passed through to our customers 
with respect to flightseeing aircraft  we allocate block space to cruise lines and sell seats directly to customers 
the company s principal customers in the us gulf of mexico are oil companies of varying sizes and production management companies 
in alaska  the company s principal customers are oil companies and cruise line passengers 
there are other markets for our helicopter transportation services that include oil and gas industry support activities abroad  agricultural support and general aviation activities 
our activity in these markets is limited 
we have helicopters operating abroad under leases to third parties 
in no one customer was responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues 
the ten largest customers of aviation services accounted for approximately of aviation services operating revenues 
the loss of one or a few of our customers could have a material adverse effect on aviation services results of operations 
competitive conditions the helicopter transportation business is highly competitive 
there are two major competitors in the us  phi  inc and bristow group inc  as well as several other smaller companies 
in addition  several customers in the us gulf of mexico operate their own helicopter fleets 
we are one of the largest helicopter companies operating in the us gulf of mexico and the largest operator in alaska 
in most instances  an operator must have an acceptable safety record  demonstrated reliability and suitable equipment to participate in bidding for work 
among bidders meeting these criteria  customers typically make their final choice based on price and aircraft preference 
environmental services business environmental services primarily provides emergency preparedness and response services to oil  chemical  industrial and marine transportation clients in the us and abroad 
in the united states  these services are generally rendered to those clients who store  transport  produce or handle petroleum and certain non petroleum oils that are subject to the provisions of opa and various other federal  state and municipal regulations 
internationally  these services may be required by legislation and regulation of the countries where our clients operate  international maritime conventions and environmental covenants placed on clients by their lending institutions 
we conduct our business primarily through the company s wholly owned subsidiaries  national response corporation nrc  the o brien s group  inc and seacor environmental services international limited

these services include hazardous waste management  industrial and marine cleaning  salvage support  petroleum storage tank removal  pipeline repair and site remediation services 
some of these projects are required or governed by federal  state or local regulations 
also  many of these projects are the result of competitive bidding conducted by our customers 
markets the market for contractual oil spill preparedness  response and other related training and consulting services in the us resulted from the enactment of opa following the exxon valdez oil spill in alaska 
opa and subsequent regulations promulgated by the department of transportation dot  environmental protection agency epa  the minerals management service division of the us department of interior mms and the united states coast guard uscg requires that all tank vessels operating within the mile exclusive economic zone of the united states and all facilities and pipelines handling oil that could have a spill affecting the navigable waters of the us develop a plan to respond to a worst case oil spill and ensure by contract or other approved means the ability to respond to such a spill 
we also provide vessel security assessments  security plans  security training and exercises and other related services 
we market these services to clients who are required to comply with the maritime transportation security act of which was enacted following the september  terrorist attacks

in there was no single customer responsible for or more of consolidated operating revenues 
the ten largest customers of environmental services accounted for approximately of environmental services operating revenues 
the loss of a single large client or a group of mid size customers could have a material adverse effect on environmental services results of operations 
however  environmental services has more than  customers  and management does not believe that it is dependent on a single customer or small group of customers 
competitive conditions the principal competitive factors in the environmental service business are price  customer service  reputation  experience and operating capabilities 
in the us  nrc faces competition primarily from the marine spill response corporation  a non profit corporation funded by the major integrated oil companies  other non profit industry cooperatives and also from those commercial contractors who target specific market niches in response  consulting and remediation 
internationally  competition for both oil spill response and emergency preparedness and management comes from a few private companies and regional oil industry cooperatives 
risks of foreign operations environmental services operates worldwide 
services include oil spill and hazardous material response  environmental and engineering project management  training and consultancy to multinational oil companies  governments and industry 
for the years ended december   and approximately   and  respectively  of environmental services operating revenues were derived from its foreign operations 
foreign operations are subject to various inherent risks 
these risks include  among others  political instability  nationalization of assets  terrorist attacks  the repatriation of income or capital  import export quotas and other forms of public and governmental regulation  all of which are beyond the control of the company 
it is not possible to predict whether any of these conditions or events might develop in the future

all of our chemical and petroleum product tankers  harbor and offshore towing vessels  certain of our offshore marine vessels and all of our inland river tank barges that are operated by a third party are subject to periodic inspection and survey by  and drydocking and maintenance requirements of  the uscg and or the american bureau of shipping and other marine classification societies 
moreover  to insure compliance with applicable safety regulations  the uscg is authorized to inspect vessels at will 
nrc  one of our environmental services companies  is classified by the uscg as an oil spill removal organization osro for every port in the continental us  hawaii and the caribbean 
the osro classification process is strictly voluntary 
vessel owners and other customers subject to opa who utilize classified osros are exempt from the requirement to list their response resources in their plans 
the classification process permits the uscg and these customers to evaluate the ability of an osro to respond to and recover oil spills of various types and sizes in different operating environments and geographic locations 
in addition to the uscg  the epa  the office of pipeline safety  the mms and certain individual states regulate vessels  facilities and pipelines in accordance with the requirements of opa or under analogous state law 
there is currently little uniformity among the regulations issued by these agencies 
when responding to third party oil spills  environmental services enjoys immunity from liability under federal law and some state laws for any spills arising from its response efforts  except in the event of deaths or personal injuries as a result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct 
environmental compliance as more fully described below  all of our businesses are  to some degree  subject to federal  state  local and international laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and occupational safety and health  including laws that govern the discharge of oil and pollutants into navigable waters 
violations of these laws may result in civil and criminal penalties  fines  injunctions or other sanctions 
we believe that our operations currently are in compliance with all material environmental laws and regulations 
we do not expect that we will be required to make capital expenditures in the near future that are material to our financial position or operations to comply with environmental laws and regulations  however  because such laws and regulations are frequently changing and may impose increasingly strict requirements  we cannot predict the ultimate cost of complying with these laws and regulations 
the recent trend in environmental legislation and regulation is generally toward stricter standards  and it is our view that this trend is likely to continue 
opa establishes a regulatory and liability regime for the protection of the environment from oil spills 
opa applies to owners and operators of facilities operating near navigable waters and owners and operators of vessels operating in us waters  which include the navigable waters of the united states and the mile exclusive economic zone of the united states 
although it appears to apply in general to all vessels  for purposes of its liability limits and financial responsibility and response planning requirements  opa differentiates between tank vessels which include our chemical and petroleum product vessels and other vessels which include our tugs  offshore marine vessels and dry cargo barges 
under opa  owners and operators of regulated facilities and owners and operators or certain charterers of vessels are responsible parties and are jointly  severally and strictly liable for removal costs and damages arising from facility and vessel oil spills unless the spill results solely from the act or omission of certain third parties under specified circumstances  an act of god or an act of war 
damages are defined broadly to include i injury to natural resources and the costs of remediation thereof  ii injury to  or economic losses resulting from the destruction of  real and personal property  iii net loss by the us government  a state or political subdivision thereof of taxes  royalties  rents  fees and profits  iv lost profits or impairment of earning capacity due to property or natural resources damage  v net costs of providing increased or additional public services necessitated by a spill response  such as protection from fire  safety or other hazards  and vi loss of subsistence use of available natural resources 
the statutory liability of responsible parties for tank vessels is limited to the greater of  per gross ton or million million for a vessel of  gross tons or less per vessel  for any other vessel  such liability is limited to the greater of per gross ton or  per vessel 
these liability limits do not apply a if an incident is caused by the responsible party s violation of federal safety  construction or operating regulations or by the responsible party s gross negligence or willful misconduct  b if the responsible party fails to report the incident or to provide reasonable cooperation and assistance in connection with oil removal activities as required by a responsible official or c if the responsible party fails to comply with certain governmental orders 
under opa  with certain limited exceptions  all newly built oil tankers carrying crude oil and petroleum products in us waters must have double hulls 
existing single hull  double side or double bottom tank vessels  unless retrofitted with double hulls  must be phased out of service at some point through  depending upon the vessel s size  age and place of discharge 
opa expanded pre existing financial responsibility requirements and requires tank vessel owners and operators to establish and maintain with the uscg evidence of insurance or qualification as a self insurer or other evidence of financial responsibility sufficient to meet their potential liabilities under opa we have satisfied uscg regulations by providing evidence of financial responsibility demonstrated by commercial insurance and self insurance 
the regulations also implement the financial responsibility requirements of the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  described below  which imposes liability for discharges of hazardous substances such as chemicals  in an amount equal to per gross ton  thus increasing the overall financial responsibility in the case of tank vessels from  to  per gross ton 
opa also amended the clean water act cwa  also described below  to require the owner or operator of certain facilities or of a tank vessel to prepare facility or vessel response plans and to contract with oil spill removal organizations to remove  to the maximum extent practicable  a worst case discharge 
the company has complied with these requirements 
we expect our pollution liability insurance to cover any cost of spill removal subject to overall coverage limitations of billion  however  a failure or refusal of the insurance carrier to provide coverage in the event of a catastrophic spill could result in material liability in excess of available insurance coverage  resulting in a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial position 
opa allows states to impose their own liability regimes with respect to oil pollution incidents occurring within their boundaries and many states have enacted legislation providing for unlimited liability for oil spills 
some states have issued regulations addressing financial responsibility and vessel and facility response planning requirements 
we do not anticipate that state legislation or regulations will have any material impact on our operations 
in addition to opa  the following are examples of environmental laws that relate to our business and operations the federal cwa and comparable state and local laws impose restrictions on the discharge of pollutants into the navigable waters of the united states 
these laws also provide for civil and criminal penalties  as well as injunctive relief  for violations 
a related statute  the coastal zone management act  authorizes state development and implementation of programs to manage non point source pollution to restore and protect coastal waters 
the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra and comparable state and local laws regulate the generation  transportation  treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous and certain non hazardous wastes 
these laws also provide for civil and criminal penalties  as well as injunctive relief  for violations 
our operations may generate or  in some cases  result in the transportation of these regulated wastes 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act cercla and comparable state laws establish strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liabilities for specified parties in connection with liability for the investigation and remediation of releases of hazardous materials into the environment and damages to natural resources 
the federal clean air act caa and comparable state and local laws impose restrictions on the emission of air pollutants into the atmosphere 
these laws also provide for civil and criminal penalties  as well as injunctive relief  for violations 
our chemical and petroleum product carrier vessels are subject to vapor control and recovery requirements when loading  unloading  ballasting  cleaning  and conducting other operations in certain ports and are equipped with vapor control systems that satisfy these requirements in all material respects 
we manage exposure to losses from the above described laws through our efforts to use only well maintained  well managed and equipped facilities and vessels and our development of safety and environmental programs  including a maritime compliance program and our insurance program 
we believe we will be able to accommodate reasonably foreseeable environmental regulatory changes 
there can be no assurance  however  that any future regulations or requirements or that any discharge or emission of pollutants by us will not have a material adverse effect 
security heightened awareness of security needs brought about by the events of september  has caused the uscg  the imo and the states and local ports to adopt heightened security procedures relating to ports and vessels 
the company has updated its procedures in light of the new requirements 
in  congress passed the maritime transportation security act mtsa  which together with the imo s recent security proposals collectively known as the international ship and port facility security code or isps  requires specific security plans for our vessels and rigorous crew identification requirements 
the following vessels are subject to the requirements of the isps us flag vessels operating in the jones act trade that are at least gross registered tons us flag vessels operating on an international voyage foreign flag vessels that are at least gross tons under the international tonnage convention the company has implemented vessel security plans and procedures for each of its us flag vessels pursuant to rules implementing the mtsa which have been issued by the uscg 
the company anticipates that the costs of security for our business will continue to increase 
the company s us flag vessels  subject to the requirements of the isps  all foreign flag vessels and us flag vessels  operating on an international voyage  were in compliance with the isps requirements effective july  industry hazards and insurance vessel operations involve inherent risks associated with carrying large volumes of cargo and rendering services in a marine environment 
in addition  helicopter operations are potentially hazardous and may result in incidents or accidents 
hazards include adverse weather conditions  collisions  fire and mechanical failures  which may result in injury to personnel  damage to equipment  loss of operating revenues  contamination of cargo  pollution and other environmental damages and increased costs 
the company maintains marine and aviation hull  liability and war risk  general liability  workers compensation and other insurance customary in the industries in which we operate 
we also conduct training and safety programs to promote a safe working environment and minimize hazards 
employees as of december   the company employed  individuals directly and indirectly through crewing or manning agreements 
substantially all indirect employees support offshore marine services vessel operations 
at december   offshore marine services employed seafarers in the north sea of whom were members of a union under the terms of an ongoing agreement 
in the united states  a total of approximately employees are unionized in marine transportation services and harbor and offshore towing services 
the union agreements expire at varying times through august  certain individuals in environmental services are also represented by unions 
the unionization of domestic seamen and or aviation employees could arise in the future 
management considers relations with its employees to be satisfactory 
item a 
risk factors risks  uncertainties and other factors that may affect future results demand for many of our services substantially depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and natural gas exploration  development and production industry 
the level of offshore oil and natural gas exploration  development and production activity has historically been volatile and that volatility is likely to continue 
the level of activity is subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in a variety of factors that are beyond our control  including prevailing oil and natural gas prices and expectations about future prices and price volatility the cost of exploring for  producing and delivering oil and natural gas offshore worldwide demand for energy and other petroleum products as well as chemical products availability and rate of discovery of new oil and natural gas reserves in offshore areas local and international political and economic conditions and policies including cabotage and local content laws technological advances affecting energy production and consumption weather conditions environmental regulation the ability of oil and natural gas companies to generate or otherwise obtain funds for capital a prolonged material downturn in oil and natural gas prices is likely to cause a substantial decline in expenditures for exploration  development and production activity 
lower levels of expenditure and activity would result in a decline in the demand and lower rates for our offshore energy support services and tanker services 
moreover  approximately of our offshore marine services and of our aviation services are currently conducted in the us gulf of mexico and are therefore dependent on levels of activity in that region  which may differ from levels of activity in other regions of the world 
we conduct international operations  which involve additional risks 
we operate vessels and lease helicopters worldwide 
activity outside the us involves additional risks  including the possibility of restrictive actions by foreign governments  including asset seizure foreign taxation and changes in foreign tax laws limitations on the repatriation of earnings changes in currency exchange rates local cabotage and local ownership laws and requirements nationalization and expropriation loss of contract rights political instability  war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets our ability to compete in the international offshore energy support market may be adversely affected by foreign government regulations that favor or require the awarding of contracts to local competitors  or that require foreign persons to employ citizens of  or purchase supplies from  a particular jurisdiction 
further  our foreign subsidiaries may face governmentally imposed restrictions on their ability to transfer funds to their parent company 
unstable political  military and economic conditions in foreign countries where a significant proportion of offshore marine services operations are conducted could adversely impact our business 
during  approximately of our offshore marine services operating revenues resulted from offshore marine services foreign operations 
these operations are subject to risks  including potential vessel seizure  terrorist attacks  piracy  kidnapping  nationalization of assets  currency restrictions  import or export quotas and other forms of public and government regulation  all of which are beyond our control 
economic sanctions or an oil embargo  for example could have significant impact on activity in the oil and gas industry and correspondingly on us should offshore marine services operate vessels in a country subject to any sanctions or embargo  or in the surrounding region to the extent any sanctions or embargo disrupt our operations in the region 
offshore marine services  marine transportation services and aviation services rely on several customers for a significant share of their revenues  the loss of which could adversely affect offshore marine services  marine transportation services and aviation services businesses and operating results 
offshore marine services  marine transportation services and aviation services customers are primarily major oil companies and large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies 
the portion of offshore marine services  marine transportation services or aviation services revenues attributable to any single customer may change over time  depending on the level of relevant activity by such customer  our ability to meet the customer s needs and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
consolidation of our customer base could adversely affect demand for our equipment and reduce our revenues 
oil and natural gas companies  energy companies and drilling contractors have undergone substantial consolidation in the last few years 
additional consolidation is likely 
consolidation results in fewer companies to charter or contract for our equipment 
also  merger activity among both major and independent oil and natural gas companies affects exploration  development and production activity as the consolidated companies integrate operations to increase efficiency and reduce costs 
less promising exploration and development projects of a combined company may be dropped or delayed 
such activity may result in an exploration and development budget for a combined company that is lower than the total budget of both companies before consolidation  adversely affecting demand for our offshore marine services vessels  marine transportation services tankers and aviation services helicopters  thereby reducing our revenues 
we may be unable to maintain or replace our vessels as they age 
as of december   the average age of our offshore marine services vessels  excluding its standby safety vessels  was approximately years 
the company believes that after an offshore support vessel has been in service for approximately years  the expense which typically increases with age necessary to satisfy required marine certification standards may not be economically justifiable 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to maintain its fleet by extending the economic life of existing vessels  or that its financial resources will be sufficient to enable it to make expenditures necessary for these purposes or to acquire or build replacement vessels 
an increase in the supply of offshore support vessels or tankers would likely have an adverse impact on the charter rates earned by our offshore support vessels and tankers 
expansion of the worldwide offshore support vessel fleet would increase competition in the markets where offshore marine services operates 
the refurbishment of disused or mothballed vessels  conversion of vessels from uses other than oil and gas exploration and production support and related activities or construction of new vessels could all add vessel capacity to current worldwide levels 
a significant increase in vessel capacity could lower charter rates and result in lower operating revenues 
similarly  should our competitors in the domestic petroleum and chemical product tankers industry construct a significant number of new tankers or large capacity integrated or articulated tug and barges  demand for our tanker assets could be adversely affected 
if we do not restrict the amount of foreign ownership of our common stock  we could be prohibited from operating our offshore support vessels  inland river vessels and barges and tankers in parts of the us and could be prohibited from operating our helicopters  which would adversely impact our business and operating results 
we are subject to the shipping acts  which govern  among other things  the ownership and operation of offshore support vessels  tankers and barges used to carry cargo between us ports 
the acts require that vessels engaged in the us coastwise trade be owned by us citizens and built in the us we are also subject to regulations pursuant to the federal aviation act and other statutes aviation acts 
generally  our aircraft operating in the us must be registered in the us in order to register such aircraft under the aviation acts  we must be owned or controlled by us citizens 
although our certificate of incorporation and by laws contain provisions intended to assure compliance with these provisions of the shipping acts  and also comply with the aviation acts  we would be prohibited from operating our vessels in the us coastwise trade and our helicopters in the us during any period in which we did not comply with these regulations 
marine transportation services could lose jones act protection  which would result in additional competition 
a substantial portion of marine transportation services operations is conducted in the us coastwise trade 
under the jones act  this trade is restricted to vessels built in the united states  owned and manned by us citizens and registered under us law 
there have been attempts to repeal or amend the jones act  and these attempts are expected to continue in the future 
repeal of the jones act could result in additional competition from vessels built in lower cost foreign shipyards and owned and manned by foreign nationals with promotional foreign tax incentives and with lower wages and benefits than us citizens  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
failure to maintain an acceptable safety record may have an adverse impact on our ability to retain customers 
our customers consider safety and reliability a primary concern in selecting a service provider 
we must maintain a record of safety and reliability that is acceptable to our customers 
should this not be achieved  the ability to retain current customers and attract new customers may be adversely affected 
the outer continental shelf lands act  as amended  provides the federal government with broad discretion in regulating the leasing of offshore resources for the production of oil and gas 
because offshore marine operations rely on offshore oil and gas exploration and production  the government s exercise of authority under the provisions of the outer continental shelf lands act  to restrict the availability of offshore oil and gas leases could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
operational risks could disrupt offshore marine services  marine transportation services  harbor and offshore towing services and aviation services and expose us to liability 
the operation of offshore support vessels  tankers  tugs  and helicopters is subject to various risks  including catastrophic disaster  adverse weather  mechanical failure and collision 
additional risks to vessels include sea conditions  capsizing  grounding  oil and hazardous substance spills and navigation errors 
these risks could endanger the safety of our personnel  equipment  cargo and other property  as well as the environment 
if any of these events were to occur  we could be held liable for resulting damages 
in addition  the affected vessels or helicopters could be removed from service and would not be available to generate revenues 
aviation services may be subject to adverse weather conditions and seasonality 
a significant portion of the company s revenues from aviation services is dependent on actual flight hours 
prolonged periods of adverse weather  storms and the effect of fewer hours of daylight adversely impact aviation services 
winter months generally have more days of adverse weather conditions than the other months of the year with poor visibility  high winds  heavy precipitation and fewer daylight hours all adversely affecting the operations of helicopters 
june through november is tropical storm season in the us gulf of mexico  during tropical storms  helicopters are unable to operate in the area of the storm 
in addition  many of aviation services facilities are located along the us gulf of mexico coast and tropical storms may cause damage to its property 
revenue from our tanker segment and towing activities could be adversely affected by a decline in demand for domestic refined petroleum products  crude oil or chemical products  or a change in existing methods of delivery 
a reduction in domestic consumption of refined petroleum products  crude oil or chemical products may adversely affect revenue from our tanker segment and towing activities 
weather conditions also affect demand for our tanker services and towing services 
for example  a mild winter may reduce demand for heating oil in our areas of operation 
moreover  alternative methods of delivery of refined petroleum  natural gas or crude oil may be developed and therefore reduce demand for our services 
finally  a reduction in domestic refining capacity would reduce demand for our services 
construction of additional refined petroleum product  natural gas or crude oil pipelines could have a material adverse effect on our tanker and towing revenues 
long haul transportation of refined petroleum products  crude oil and natural gas is generally less costly by pipeline than by tanker 
existing pipeline systems are either insufficient to meet demand in  or do not reach all of  the markets served by our tankers 
new pipeline segments are being planned and approved for the florida market 
the construction and operation of these pipelines could have an adverse effect on our tanker and towing businesses 
we may have to phase out some of our single hull tankers from petroleum product transportation service in us waters 
opa establishes a phase out schedule  depending upon vessel size and age  for non double hull vessels carrying crude oil and petroleum products in us coastwise transportation 
the phase out dates for our non double hull tankers are as follows seabulk magnachem  seabulk power and seabulk america as a result of this requirement  unless these vessels are modified with double hulls  which will require substantial capital expenditures  they will be prohibited from transporting crude oil and petroleum products in us coastwise transportation after their phase out dates 
they would also be prohibited from transporting petroleum products in most foreign and international markets under a phase out schedule established by the imo were we to attempt to enter those markets 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
increasingly stringent federal  state  local and international laws and regulations governing worker safety and health and the manning  construction and operation of vessels significantly affect our operations 
many aspects of the marine industry are subject to extensive governmental regulation by the uscg  occupational safety and health administration osha  the ntsb and the us customs service and to regulation by port states and class society organizations such as the american bureau of shipping  as well as to international regulations from international treaties such as the safety of life at sea convention administered by port states and class societies 
the uscg  the osha and the ntsb set safety standards and are authorized to investigate vessel accidents and recommend improved safety standards 
the us customs service is authorized to inspect vessels at will 
our business and operations are also subject to federal  state  local and international laws and regulations that control the discharge of oil and hazardous materials into the environment or otherwise relate to environmental protection and occupational safety and health 
compliance with such laws and regulations may require installation of costly equipment or operational changes  and the phase out of certain product tankers 
failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations may result in administrative and civil penalties  criminal sanctions or the suspension or termination of our operations 
some environmental laws impose strict and  under certain circumstances  joint and several liability for remediation of spills and releases of oil and hazardous materials and damage to natural resources  which could subject us to liability without regard to whether we were negligent or at fault 
these laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  including charterers 
moreover  these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase our costs 
we cannot be certain that existing laws  regulations or standards  as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future  or future laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
for more information  see item governmental regulation environmental compliance 
spill response revenue is subject to significant volatility 
environmental services response revenues are event driven and can vary greatly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on the number and magnitude of responses 
as a result  environmental services profitability may also vary greatly from year to year 
a relaxation of oil spill regulation or enforcement could reduce demand for environmental services services 
environmental services is dependent upon the enforcement of regulations promulgated under opa  international conventions and  to a lesser extent  upon local regulations 
less stringent oil spill regulations or less aggressive enforcement of these regulations would decrease demand for environmental services services 
there can be no assurance that oil spill regulation will not be relaxed or enforcement of existing or future regulation will not become less stringent 
if this happens  the demand for environmental services oil spill response services could be adversely impacted 
a change in  or revocation of  nrc s classification as an oil spill removal organization would result in a loss of business 
nrc is classified by the uscg as an osro 
the uscg classifies osros based on their overall ability to respond to various types and sizes of oil spills 
uscg classified osros have a competitive advantage over non classified service providers because customers of a classified osro are exempt from regulations that would otherwise require them to list their oil spill response resources in filings with the uscg 
a loss of nrc s classification or changes in the requirements for classification could eliminate or diminish nrc s ability to provide customers with this exemption 
if this happens  environmental services could lose customers 
environmental services could incur liability in connection with providing spill response services 
although environmental services is generally exempt from liability under the cwa for its own actions and omissions in providing spill response services  this exemption might not apply if it were found to have been grossly negligent or to have engaged in willful misconduct  or if it were to have failed to provide these services consistent with applicable regulations and directives under the cwa 
in addition  the exemption under the federal cwa would not protect environmental services against liability for personal injury or wrongful death  or against prosecution under other federal or state laws 
while most of the us states in which environmental services provides service have adopted similar exemptions  several states have not 
if a court or other applicable authority were to determine that environmental services does not benefit from federal or state exemptions from liability in providing spill response services  environmental services could be liable together with the local contractor and the responsible party for any resulting damages  including damages caused by others 
inland river services could experience variation in freight rates 
freight transportation rates may fluctuate as the volume of cargo and availability of barges changes 
volume of freight transported on the inland waterways may vary as a result of various factors  such as global economic conditions and business cycles  domestic and international agricultural production and demand and foreign currency exchange rates 
barge participation in the industry can also vary year to year and is dependent on the number of barges built and retired from service 
extended periods of high barge availability and low cargo demand could adversely impact inland river services 
inland river services results of operations could be adversely affected by the decline in us grain exports 
inland river services business is significantly affected by the volume of grain exports handled through us gulf of mexico ports 
grain exports can vary due to a number of factors including the crop harvest yield levels in the us and abroad  and the demand for grain in the us the shortage of available grain overseas can increase demand for us grain 
conversely  an abundance of grain overseas can decrease demand for us grain 
a decline in exports could result in excess barge capacity  which would likely lower freight rates earned by inland river services 
inland river services results of operations could be adversely affected by international economic and political factors 
the actions of foreign governments could affect the import and export of the dry bulk commodities typically transported by inland river services 
foreign trade agreements and each country s adherence to the terms of such agreements can raise or lower demand for us imports and exports of the dry bulk commodities inland river services transports 
national and international boycotts and embargoes of other countries or us imports or exports together with the raising or lowering of tariff rates will affect the demand for transportation of the cargos inland river services transports 
these actions or developments could have an adverse impact on inland river services 
inland river services results of operations are affected by seasonal activity 
inland river services business is seasonal  and its quarterly revenues and profits have historically been lower during the first and second quarters of the year and higher during the third and fourth quarters during the grain harvest 
inland river services results of operations are affected by adverse weather and river conditions 
weather patterns can affect river levels and cause ice conditions during winter months  which can hamper barge navigation 
locks on river systems may be closed for maintenance or other causes  which may delay barge movements 
these conditions could adversely impact inland river services 
inland river services results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by fuel price fluctuations 
for the most part  inland river services purchases towboat and fleeting services from third party vendors 
it is indirectly exposed to increases in fuel prices  as vendors will adjust the price of the services when fuel prices escalate 
if this happens  inland river services results of operation may be adversely affected 
our insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect the company from the liabilities that could arise in our businesses 
we maintain insurance coverage against the risks related to our businesses 
there can be no assurance  however  that existing insurance coverage can be renewed at commercially reasonable rates or that available coverage will be adequate to cover future claims 
if a loss occurs that is partially or completely uninsured  we could be exposed to substantial liability 
our global operations are subject to currency exchange risks 
in some of our foreign businesses  we collect revenues and pay expenses in local currency 
if the value of foreign currencies in particular the value of the british pound sterling decline against the us dollar and we do not or are not able to minimize the effects of such fluctuations through currency hedging arrangements  our operating results may be adversely affected 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur losses in the future as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations 
our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on us 
attracting and retaining skilled personnel across all of our business segments is an important factor in our future success 
the market for the personnel we employ is very competitive and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in attracting and retaining qualified personnel in the future

unresolved staff comments none item properties offshore support vessels  tankers  barges and helicopters are the principal physical properties owned by the company and are more fully described in offshore marine services  marine transportation services  inland river services and aviation services in item business 
item legal proceedings in the ordinary course of its business  the company becomes involved in various litigation matters including  among other things  claims by third parties for alleged property damages  personal injuries and other matters 
while the company believes it has meritorious defenses against these claims  management has used estimates in determining the company s potential exposure and has recorded reserves in its financial statements related thereto where appropriate 
it is possible that a change in the company s estimates of such exposure could occur  but the company does not expect such changes in estimated costs will have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of its operations 
in june  a subsidiary of seacor received a document subpoena from the antitrust division of the us department of justice 
this subpoena relates to a grand jury investigation of potential antitrust violations among providers of helicopter transportation services in the gulf of mexico 
the company believes that this subpoena is part of a broader industry inquiry and that other providers have also received such a subpoena 
seacor intends to provide all information requested in response to this investigation 
under united states law  united states persons are prohibited from business activities and contracts in certain countries  including sudan and iran 
relating to the prohibitions  seabulk filed three reports with  and submitted documents to  the office of foreign asset control ofac of the us department of treasury in december and january and may one of the reports was also filed with the bureau of export administration of the us department of commerce 
the reports and documents related to certain limited charters with third parties involving three seabulk vessels which called in sudan for several months in and january and charters with third parties involving several of seabulk s vessels which called in iran in in march  seabulk received notification from ofac that the case has been referred to its civil penalties division 
should ofac determine that these activities constituted violations of the laws or regulations  civil penalties  including fines  could be assessed against seabulk or certain individuals who knowingly participated in such activity 
the company cannot predict the extent of such penalties  however  management does not believe the outcome of these matters will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations
