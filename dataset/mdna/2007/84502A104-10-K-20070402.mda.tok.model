item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further information about the corporation  see selected statistical information on pages of this report on form k 
overview the corporation is a full service community bank holding company headquartered in moultrie  georgia 
the community of moultrie has been served by the bank since we provide comprehensive financial services to consumer  business and governmental customers  which  in addition to conventional banking products  include a full range of mortgage banking  trust  investment and insurance services 
our primary market area incorporates colquitt county  where we are headquartered  and baker  thomas  and worth counties  each contiguous with colquitt county  and the surrounding counties of southwest georgia 
we have four full service banking facilities and six automated teller machines 
our strategy is to maintain the diversity of our revenue  including both interest and noninterest income through a broad base of business  strengthen our sales and marketing efforts while developing our employees to provide the best possible service to our customers  expand our market share where opportunity exists  and grow outside of our current geographic market through acquisitions into areas proximate to our current market area 
the corporation s profitability  like most financial institutions  is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income  which is the difference between the interest received on earning assets  such as loans  securities and federal funds sold  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is highly sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates 
in the first half of  the federal reserve bank increased short term interest rates and since july  short term rates increased seventeen times  or by year end 
our profitability is impacted as well by operating expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and income taxes 
our lending activities are significantly influenced by regional and local factors such as changes in population  competition among lenders  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing uses of funds and investments  customer preferences and levels of personal income and savings in the corporation s primary market area 
to address interest rate fluctuations  we manage our balance sheet in an effort to diminish the impact should interest rates suddenly change 
in addition  broadening our revenue sources helps to reduce the risk and exposure of our financial results to the impact of changes in interest rates  which is outside of our control 
as a result of our strategy to diversify revenue  noninterest income has grown over the last few years and was of net interest income 
sources of noninterest income include our insurance agency and empire  the corporation s commercial mortgage banking subsidiary  as well as fees on customer accounts  trust and retail brokerage services 
in  we continued to focus on asset quality following significant improvements made with respect to overall asset quality in and during the second quarter of  we sold a large foreclosed property with a loss on sale of approximately  although the corporation has a single million nonaccrual loan that has caused a substantial increase in nonperforming loans in  we do not anticipate any loss on this loan due to a sales contract that is currently in process which will either pay off or assume this loan 
mergers and acquisitions on february   the corporation acquired first bank holding company and its bank subsidiary  sylvester banking company  for million in cash and  shares of southwest georgia financial corporation common stock valued at million 
sylvester banking company was merged into southwest georgia bank 
the business combination was accounted for by the purchase method of accounting and the results of operations of sylvester banking company since the date of acquisition are included in the consolidated financial statements 
total assets of million and liabilities of million were booked at fair value including a core deposit intangible of million 
this core deposit intangible is being amortized over a year period

tender offer on october   the corporation repurchased  shares of our common stock through a tender offer with a total cost of  the tender offer caused a decrease in the number of shares outstanding  stockholder s equity and book and tangible book value per share 
stock dividend on october   the corporation paid a stock dividend to shareholders of record as of october  all per share information has been adjusted to take into account the stock dividend 
critical accounting policies in the course of the corporation s normal business activity  management must select and apply many accounting policies and methodologies that lead to the financial results presented in the consolidated financial statements of the corporation 
management considers the accounting policy relating to the allowance for loan losses to be a critical accounting policy because of the uncertainty and subjectivity inherent in estimating the levels of allowance needed to cover probable credit losses within the loan portfolio and the material effect that these estimates have on the corporation s results of operations 
we believe that the allowance for loan losses as of december  is adequate  however  under adversely different conditions or assumptions  future additions to the allowance may be necessary 
there have been no significant changes in the methods or assumptions used in our accounting policies that would have resulted in material estimates and assumptions changes 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a description of our significant accounting policies and contributes to the understanding of how our financial performance is reported 
results of operations performance summary net income for was million  a decrease of approximately million  or  when compared with million in our net income was down primarily as a result of a  loss recognized in our investment securities portfolio in connection with funding the tender offer as well as  in administrative expenses related to the tender offer 
net income was also negatively impacted by a  decrease in mortgage banking income due to numerous payoffs of serviced loans at empire and accelerated amortization related to such payoffs of  a one time  pension contribution incurred in connection with the freezing of the pension plan and  a decline in our net interest margin 
on a per share basis  net income for was down to per diluted share compared with per diluted share for net income for was million  an increase of approximately million  or  when compared with million in higher net income in was primarily due to solid operating results for empire and strong expense control

net interest income net interest income for decreased  or  compared with the largest contributable to the decline in net interest income was the million  or  increase in interest expense in compared with which resulted primarily from a basis point increase in the average rate paid on money market deposit accounts  a basis point increase on the average rate paid on savings deposits and a basis point increase in the average rate paid on time deposits caused by rising rates generally and competitive pressure in our markets  and an increase in average money market deposit accounts of million or  resulting from the impact of the migration from non interest bearing accounts and time deposits in a rising rate environment and the addition of a cash management program for our business customers 
in addition  average noninterest bearing deposits increased  or

net interest margin net interest margin  which is the net return on earning assets  is a key performance ratio for evaluating net interest income 
it is computed by dividing net interest income by average total earning assets 
net interest margin was for  a basis point decrease from in the net interest margin in was down basis points compared with the net interest margin of in our net interest margin declines in each year were primarily due to higher funding costs and the shifting of deposit accounts from non interest bearing accounts into interest bearing accounts noninterest income noninterest income is an important contributor to net earnings

noninterest income in decreased  compared with the decline was primarily the result of a decrease of  in mortgage banking income  the single largest component of the corporation s noninterest income  due to numerous payoffs of serviced loans at empire 
the mortgage banking servicing portfolio at empire is comprised of non recourse loans which we service for participating commercial mortgage lenders  and  at december   was approximately million  or an decrease from the balance at december  this decline is primarily due to the numerous payoffs of serviced loans of which we feel will not continue at this current level 
noninterest income was also negatively impacted in by a  loss recognized on the sale of securities to fund the repurchase of  shares of the tender offer and decrease in fees from trust services 
offsetting in part  the declines in noninterest income  deposit service charge income increased  or  for over related primarily to increased fees from our new cash management program for our business customers and increased fees related to our overdraft protection program 
other increases resulted from a growth in fees related to insurance services and increase in fees related to retail brokerage services 
noninterest income in increased million compared with mortgage banking income increased  as loan origination fees on commercial mortgages increased over the prior year 
service charges on deposit accounts  income from trust services  and income from insurance services leveled off in gain on sale or abandonment of assets increased  resulting primarily from losses on sales of foreclosed properties in noninterest expense noninterest expense includes all expenses of the corporation other than interest expense  provision for loan losses and income tax expense

total noninterest expense increased  or  in compared with the majority of this increase of  was from increased amortization of intangible assets resulting from accelerating the amortization of our mortgage servicing assets due to the payoffs of serviced loans at empire described above 
also  increases occurred in other operating expense of due to administrative fees related to the tender offer and other professional services expenses related to pension consulting services and an increase in occupancy expense of due to normal operations 
these increases in noninterest expenses were partially offset by a decrease in data processing fees due to the expiration of a contract related to our overdraft protection program 
equipment expenses were down in due to normal operations 
salary decreased slightly due to a decrease in the number of full time employees from to  which decrease was partially offset by an additional pension contribution of  the additional pension funding was a one time charge by the corporation incurred in connection with freezing the pension plan and was necessary for the required minimum contribution 
total noninterest expense increased  or  in compared with salaries and employee benefits expense increased due to incentive based compensation at empire  increased pension contributions and increased staffing to replace near term retirees 
the corporation s employees totaled at december  compared with the prior year end 
in  occupancy expense increased  or  compared with this was primarily due to increased depreciation expense from a building renovation project completed in late the other noninterest expense categories equipment  data processing  amortization of intangible assets  and other operating expenses declined from the previous year due to incurring higher expenses related to the acquisition of sylvester banking company in the efficiency ratio noninterest expenses divided by total noninterest income plus net interest income  a measure of productivity  increased to for  from for and for the higher efficiency ratio was primarily due to lower revenues 
federal income tax expense the corporation expensed  million and million for federal income taxes for the years ending december   and  respectively 
these amounts resulted in an effective tax rate of   and for   and  respectively 
see note of the corporation s notes to consolidated financial statements for further details of tax expense 
uses and sources of funds the corporation  primarily through the bank  acts as a financial intermediary 
as such  our financial condition should be considered in terms of how we manage our sources and uses of funds 
our primary sources of funds are deposits and borrowings 
we invest our funds in assets  and our earning assets are what provide us income 
during  total average assets increased million  or  to million 
the corporation s earning assets  which include loans  investment securities  deposits at the federal home loan bank  and federal funds sold averaged million in  a increase over million in this increase was primarily the result of improved loan volume  which also caused the earning asset mix to shift towards more loans during the year 
for  average earning assets were comprised of loans  investment securities  and federal funds sold and funds at the federal home loan bank 
the ratio of average earning assets to average total assets slightly decreased to for compared with for loans loans are one of the corporation s largest earning assets and users of funds 
because of the importance of loans  most of the other assets and liabilities are managed to accommodate the needs of the loan portfolio

the ratio of total loans to total deposits at year end increased to in compared with in the loan portfolio mix at year end consisted of loans secured by construction real estate  loans secured by commercial real estate  of loans secured by residential real estate  and of loans secured by agricultural real estate 
the loan portfolio also included other commercial  financial  and agricultural purposes of and installment loans to individuals for consumer purposes of 
allowance and provision for possible loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents our estimate of the amount required for probable loan losses in the corporation s loan portfolio 
loans  or portions thereof  which are considered to be uncollectible  are charged against this allowance and any subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance 
there can be no assurance that the corporation will not sustain losses in future periods which could be substantial in relation to the size of the allowance for loan losses at december  we have a loan review program in place which provides for the regular examination and evaluation of the risk elements within the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is regularly evaluated based on the review of all significant loans with particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due  and other potentially impaired loans that have been identified as possible problems 
the allowance for loan losses was million  or of total loans outstanding  as of december  this level represented a  decrease from the corresponding year end amount which was of total loans outstanding 
there was no provision for loan losses in  a  decrease from the prior year s provision 
our assessment of the adequacy of the allowance to absorb possible losses in the loan portfolio resulted in not having to provide for losses during the year 
see note of the corporation s notes to consolidated financial statements for details of the changes in the allowance for loan losses 
investment securities the corporation s investment securities consist primarily of us government agency securities 
the investment portfolio serves several important functions for the corporation 
investments in securities are used as a source of income  to complement loan demand and to satisfy pledging requirements in the most profitable way possible 
the investment portfolio is a source of liquidity when loan demand exceeds funding availability  and is a vehicle for adjusting balance sheet sensitivity to cushion against adverse rate movements 
our investment policy attempts to provide adequate liquidity by maintaining a portfolio with staggered maturities ranging from one to five years

the total investment portfolio decreased to million from million at year end compared with year end  a decrease of million  or 
the majority of this decrease was due to the sale of securities to fund our tender offer 
also  other decreases resulted from the maturing and called us government agency securities and to an increase in loan demand 
the average total investment portfolio decreased to million in compared with million for we will continue to actively manage the size  components  and maturity structure of the investment securities portfolio 
future investment strategies will continue to be based on profit objectives  economic conditions  interest rate risk objectives  and balance sheet liquidity demands 
nonperforming assets nonperforming assets are defined as nonaccrual loans  loans that are days past due and still accruing  and property acquired by foreclosure 
the level of nonperforming assets increased million at year end compared with year end this increase primarily resulted from a single loan and no loss is anticipated due to a sales contract that is currently is process which will either pay off or assume this loan 
nonperforming assets were approximately  or of total assets as of december   compared with  or of total assets at year end deposits and other interest bearing liabilities our primary source of funds is deposits 
the corporation offers a variety of deposit accounts having a wide range of interest rates and terms 
we rely primarily on competitive pricing policies and customer service to attract and retain these deposits 
in  average deposits increased compared with from million to million 
the majority of the increase in average deposits occurred in average money market deposit accounts and now account deposits 
competitive interest rates during resulted in change in the deposit mix 
some customers shifted money from savings to money markets due to higher rates paid on money market account deposits 
also  we implemented a cash management program for commercial customers which provided money market rates of return for large cash balances 
as of december   the corporation had a total of million in certificates of deposit of  or more each 
this was an increase over the million total in we have used borrowings from the federal home loan bank to support our residential mortgage lending activities 
during  the corporation repaid short term advances with the federal home loan bank of million leaving million to be paid in june and million to be paid in august of in  the corporation borrowed no additional advances from the federal home loan bank 
total long term advances with the federal home loan bank were million at december  details on the federal home bank advances are presented in note to the financial statements 
liquidity liquidity is managed to assume that the corporation can meet the cash flow requirements of customers who may be either depositors wanting to withdraw their funds or borrowers needing funds to meet their credit needs 
many factors affect the ability to accomplish liquidity objectives successfully 
those factors include the economic environment  our asset liability mix and our overall reputation and credit standing in the marketplace 
in the ordinary course of business  our cash flows are generated from deposits  interest and fee income  from loan repayments and the maturity or sale of other earning assets 
the consolidated statement of cash flows details the corporation s cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities 
during  operating and investing activities generated cash flows of million  while financing activities used million of this and increased the cash and due from banks balances by thousand 
cash produced from operations continues to provide cash for the payment of dividends and common stock repurchases 
liability liquidity represents our ability to renew or replace our short term borrowings and deposits as they mature or are withdrawn 
the corporation s deposit mix includes a significant amount of core deposits 
core deposits are defined as total deposits less public funds and time deposits of  or more 
these funds are relatively stable because they are generally accounts of individual customers who are concerned not only with rates paid  but with the value of the services they receive  such as efficient operations performed by helpful personnel 
total core deposits were of total deposits on december   compared with in asset liquidity is provided through ordinary business activity  such as cash which is received from interest and fee payments as well as from maturing loans and investments 
additional sources include marketable securities and short term investments which can be easily be converted to cash without significant loss 
the corporation s investment securities maturing within one year or less were million on december   which represented of the investment debt securities portfolio 
also  the corporation had million of investment securities callable at the option of the issuer and that are unlikely to be called during these maturing and callable investment securities are sources for repayment of our short term and long term debt obligations 
we are not aware of any known trends  events  or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the corporation s liquidity or operations 
contractual obligations the chart below shows the corporation s contractual obligations and commercial commitments  and its scheduled future cash payments under those commitments as of december  the majority of the corporation s outstanding contractual obligations were long term debt

off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit in the form of loans or through letters of credit 
the instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit and interest rate risk in excess of the amounts recognized in the financial statements 
since many of the commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the contractual amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements

capital resources and dividends our average equity to average assets ratio was in and in the federal reserve board and the fdic have issued rules regarding risk based capital requirements for us banks and bank holding companies 
overall  these guidelines define the components of capital  require higher levels of capital for higher risk assets and lower levels of capital for lower risk assets  and include certain off balance sheet items in the calculation of capital requirements 
the risk based capital regulations require banks to maintain an total risk based ratio  of which must consist primarily of tangible common shareholders equity tier i capital or its equivalent 
also  the regulations require a financial institution to maintain a leverage ratio 
at year end  we were well in excess of the minimum requirements under the guidelines with a total risk based capital ratio of  a tier i risk based capital ratio of  and a leverage ratio of 
the decrease in risk based capital ratios was due to the repurchase of  shares through a tender offer

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the corporation s primary market risk is exposure to interest rate movements 
we have no foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  or any other material market risk 
the corporation has no trading investment portfolio  nor do we have any interest rate swaps or other derivative instruments 
our primary source of earnings  net interest income  can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to lessen the impact of these movements  we seek to maximize net interest income while remaining within prudent ranges of risk by practicing sound interest rate sensitivity management 
we attempt to accomplish this objective by structuring the balance sheet so that the differences in repricing opportunities between assets and liabilities are minimized 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the responsiveness of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities to changes in market interest rates 
the corporation s interest rate risk management is carried out by the asset liability management committee which operates under policies and guidelines established by the bank 
the principal objective of asset liability management is to manage the levels of interest sensitive assets and liabilities to minimize net interest income fluctuations in times of fluctuating market interest rates 
to effectively measure and manage interest rate risk  the corporation uses computer simulations that determine the impact on net interest income of numerous interest rate scenarios  balance sheet trends and strategies 
these simulations cover the following financial instruments short term financial instruments  investment securities  loans  deposits  and borrowings 
these simulations incorporate assumptions about balance sheet dynamics  such as loan and deposit growth and pricing  changes in funding mix  and asset and liability repricing and maturity characteristics 
simulations are run under various interest rate scenarios to determine the impact on net income and capital 
from these computer simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are developed and implemented 
the corporation also maintains an investment portfolio that staggers maturities and provides flexibility over time in managing exposure to changes in interest rates 
any imbalances in the repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity 
the table below provides information about the corporation s financial assets and liabilities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
for each rate sensitive asset and liability listed  the table presents principal balances and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity or the earliest possible repricing opportunity dates 
one of the indicators for our interest rate sensitivity position is the measurement of the difference between its rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities  which is referred to as the gap 
a gap analysis displays the earliest possible repricing opportunity for each asset and liability category based upon contractual maturities and repricing 
at year end  our sensitivity ratio  or one year cumulative rate sensitive assets relative to cumulative rate sensitive liabilities  was compared with for this change in the sensitivity ratio was a result of the corporation s management of its exposure to interest rate risk 
we were more liability sensitive at the one year gap position compared with the previous year 
these changes in assets and liabilities occurred in growth in money market account deposits  increase in short term portion of long term debt  and decrease in short term investments 
this liability sensitive position will increase the corporation s exposure to rising interest rates 
all interest rates and yields do not adjust at the same pace  therefore  the sensitivity ratio is only a general indicator of the potential effects of interest rate changes on net interest income 
we monitor our asset and liability mix in an effort to ensure that the effects of interest rate movements in either direction are not significant over time
