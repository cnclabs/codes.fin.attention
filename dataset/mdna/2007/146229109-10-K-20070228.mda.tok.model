we also extend our brand reach by licensing our carter s  child of mine  just one year  oshkosh  and related brand names through domestic licensing arrangements  including licensing of our genuine kids from oshkosh brand to target stores nationwide 
our oshkosh b gosh brand name is also licensed through international licensing arrangements 
during fiscal  we earned approximately million in royalty income from these arrangements  including million from our oshkosh b gosh and genuine kids from oshkosh brands 
we have made significant progress integrating the oshkosh business 
our plans are to grow our oshkosh brand by focusing on our core product development and marketing disciplines  leveraging our relationships with major wholesale accounts  leveraging our infrastructure and supply chain  and improving the productivity of our oshkosh retail stores 
since the acquisition  we have reduced the number of oshkosh sub brands and have simplified the number of product offerings under our oshkosh brand 
this has allowed us to reduce product complexity  focus our efforts on essential  core products  and streamline operations 
since the acquisition  we have closed unprofitable oshkosh lifestyle stores in fiscal  oshkosh retail stores in fiscal  and closed two additional oshkosh retail stores in fiscal we are also leveraging our existing infrastructure and supply chain expertise to reduce costs

we have placed such production primarily with our vendors in the far east 
we have also integrated retail store operations and various other support functions throughout the company 
as part of financing the acquisition  we refinanced our existing debt  including our former senior credit facility and our outstanding senior subordinated notes due the notes 
in connection with the refinancing  we paid a million redemption premium on the notes  expensed million in unamortized debt issuance costs related to the former senior credit facility and repayment of the notes  and expensed million related to the debt discount on the notes

the carrying value of these assets is subject to annual impairment reviews as of the last day of each fiscal year or more frequently if deemed necessary due to any significant events or changes in circumstances 
estimated future cash flows used in such impairment reviews could be negatively impacted if we do not achieve our sales growth plans  planned cost savings  and other assumptions that support the carrying value of these intangible assets  which could result in potential impairment of such assets

revised  share based payment sfas r  which resulted in a reduction in fiscal net income of approximately million  or approximately per diluted share

based on our current level of operations  we believe that cash generated from operations and available cash  together with amounts available under our revolver  will be adequate to meet our debt service requirements  capital expenditures  and working capital needs for the foreseeable future  although no assurance can be given in this regard 
we may  however  need to refinance all or a portion of the principal amount of amounts outstanding under our revolver on or before july  and amounts outstanding under our term loan on or before july  effects of inflation and deflation we are affected by inflation and changing prices primarily through purchasing product from our global suppliers  increased operating costs and expenses  and fluctuations in interest rates 
the effects of inflation on our net sales and operations have not been material in recent years 
in recent years  there has been deflationary pressure on selling prices 
while we have been successful in offsetting such deflationary pressures through product improvements and lower costs with the expansion of our global sourcing network  if deflationary price trends outpace our ability to obtain further price reductions from our global suppliers  our profitability may be affected 
seasonality we experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and profitability  with generally lower sales and gross profit in the first and second quarters of our fiscal year 
over the past five fiscal years  excluding the impact of the acquisition in fiscal  approximately of our consolidated net sales were generated in the second half of our fiscal year 
accordingly  our results of operations for the first and second quarters of any year are not indicative of the results we expect for the full year 
as a result of this seasonality  our inventory levels and other working capital requirements generally begin to increase during the second quarter and into the third quarter of each fiscal year 
we had million in peak borrowings in fiscal and no borrowings under our former revolving credit facility or new revolver during fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies and estimates  which are those policies that require management s most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize wholesale and mass channel revenue after shipment of products to customers  when title passes  when all risks and rewards of ownership have transferred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
in certain cases  in which we retain the risk of loss during shipment  revenue recognition does not occur until the goods have reached the specified customer 
in the normal course of business  we grant certain accommodations and allowances to our wholesale and mass channel customers 
we provide accommodations and allowances to our key wholesale and mass channel customers in order to assist these customers with inventory clearance and promotions 
such amounts are reflected as a reduction of net sales and are recorded based upon historical trends and annual forecasts 
retail store revenues are recognized at the point of sale 
we reduce revenue for customer returns and deductions 
we also maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments and other actual and estimated deductions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  an additional allowance could be required 
past due balances over days are reviewed individually for collectibility 
our credit and collections department reviews all other balances regularly 
account balances are charged off against the allowance when we feel it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we contract with a third party service to provide us with the fair value of cooperative advertising arrangements entered into with certain of our major wholesale and mass channel customers 
such fair value is determined based upon  among other factors  comparable market analysis for similar advertisements 
in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer reseller  we have included the fair value of these arrangements of approximately million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal as a component of selling  general  and administrative expenses on the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations rather than as a reduction of revenue 
amounts determined to be in excess of the fair value of these arrangements are recorded as a reduction of net sales 
inventory we provide reserves for slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we project  additional write downs may be required 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and tradename as of december   we had approximately million in cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired and tradename assets 
the fair value of the carter s tradename was estimated at the acquisition to be approximately million using a discounted cash flow analysis  which examined the hypothetical cost savings that accrue as a result of our ownership of the tradename 
the fair value of the oshkosh tradename was estimated at the acquisition to be approximately million  also using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the cash flows  which incorporated both historical and projected financial performance  were discounted using a discount rate of and for carter s and oshkosh  respectively 
the tradenames were determined to have indefinite lives 
the carrying value of these assets is subject to annual impairment reviews as of the last day of each fiscal year 
factors affecting such impairment reviews include the continued market acceptance of our offered products and the development of new products 
impairment reviews may also be triggered by any significant events or changes in circumstances 
our impairment review of cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired is based on the estimated fair values of the underlying businesses 
these estimated fair values are based on estimates of the future cash flows of the businesses 
accrued expenses accrued expenses for health insurance  workers compensation  incentive compensation  and other outstanding obligations are assessed based on actual commitments  statistical trends  and estimates based on projections and current expectations  and these estimates are updated periodically as additional information becomes available 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our actual current tax exposure state  federal  and foreign  together with assessing permanent and temporary differences resulting from differing bases and treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes  such as the carrying value of intangibles  deductibility of expenses  depreciation of property  plant  and equipment  and valuation of inventories 
temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
actual results could differ from this assessment if sufficient taxable income is not generated in future periods 
to the extent we determine the need to establish a valuation allowance or increase such allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations 
stock based compensation arrangements the company accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r 
the company adopted sfas r using the modified prospective application method of transition 
the company uses the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the use of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include the following volatility this is a measure of the amount by which a stock price has fluctuated or is expected to fluctuate 
the company uses actual monthly historical changes in the market value of our stock since the company s initial public offering on october   supplemented by peer company data for periods prior to our initial public offering covering the expected life of options being valued 
an increase in the expected volatility will increase compensation expense 
risk free interest rate this is the us treasury rate as of the grant date having a term equal to the expected term of the option 
an increase in the risk free interest rate will increase compensation expense 
expected term this is the period of time over which the options granted are expected to remain outstanding and is based on historical experience and estimated future exercise behavior 
separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
an increase in the expected term will increase compensation expense 
dividend yield the company does not have plans to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
an increase in the dividend yield will decrease compensation expense 
forfeitures the company estimates forfeitures of stock based awards based on historical experience and expected future activity 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the accompanying audited consolidated statement of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return  and also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
the evaluation of a tax position in accordance with this interpretation begins with a determination as to whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement for recognition in the financial statements 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the cumulative effect  if any  of applying fin will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption 
while our analysis of the impact of this interpretation is not yet complete  we do not anticipate it will have a material impact on our retained earnings at the time of adoption 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of sfas are effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which provides entities with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities 
this statement is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after november  the company is currently evaluating the impact that sfas will have on its consolidated financial statements 
forward looking statements statements contained herein that relate to our future performance  including  without limitation  statements with respect to our anticipated results of operations or level of business for fiscal or any other future period  are forward looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on current expectations only and are subject to certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may vary materially from those anticipated  estimated  or projected 
these risks are described under the heading risk factors on page item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the operation of our business  we have market risk exposures  including those related to foreign currency risk and interest rates 
these risks and our strategies to manage our exposure to them are discussed below 
we contract for production with third parties primarily in the far east and south and central america 
while these contracts are stated in united states dollars  there can be no assurance that the cost for the future production of our products will not be affected by exchange rate fluctuations between the united states dollar and the local currencies of these contractors 
due to the number of currencies involved  we cannot quantify the potential impact of future currency fluctuations on net income in future years 
in order to manage this risk  we source products from approximately vendors worldwide  providing us with flexibility in our production should significant fluctuations occur between the united states dollar and various local currencies 
to date  such exchange fluctuations have not had a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
we do not hedge foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our operating results are subject to risk from interest rate fluctuations on our senior credit facility  which carries variable interest rates 
as of december   our outstanding debt aggregated approximately million  of which million bore interest at a variable rate 
an increase of in the applicable rate would increase our annual interest cost by million  exclusive of variable rate debt subject to our swap and collar agreements described above  and could have an adverse effect on our net income and cash flow 
other risks there also are other risks in the operation of our business specifically related to our global sourcing network 
we source all of our production from third party manufacturers primarily located in foreign countries 
as a result  we may be adversely affected by political instability resulting in the disruption of trade from foreign countries  the imposition of new regulations relating to imports  duties  taxes  and other charges on imports  including the china safeguards  any significant decreases in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  and restrictions on the transfer of funds 
these and other factors could result in the interruption of production in offshore facilities  delay receipt of the products into the united states  or affect our operating income 
our future performance may be subject to such factors  which are beyond our control  and there can be no assurance that such factors would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we carefully select our sourcing agents and  in an effort to mitigate the possible disruption in product flow  we place production in various countries that we believe to be of lower risk 
we enter into various purchase order commitments with full package suppliers 
we can cancel these arrangements  although in some instances  we may be subject to a termination charge reflecting a percentage of work performed prior to cancellation 
historically  such cancellations and related termination charges have not had a material impact on our business 
however  as we rely nearly exclusively on our full package global sourcing network  we expect to incur more of these termination charges  which could increase our cost of goods sold
