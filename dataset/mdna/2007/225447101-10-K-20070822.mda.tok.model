item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by reference to  our consolidated financial statements  including the notes thereto 
overview we develop and manufacture semiconductor materials and electronic devices primarily made from silicon carbide  or sic  gallium nitride  or gan  and related compounds 
the majority of our products are manufactured at our main production facilities in durham and research triangle park  north carolina and in our facility in huizhou  china 
we also use contract manufacturers in asia to perform some of our manufacturing steps for certain led and power products 
we generate revenues from the following product lines led chips and packaged products 
we derive the largest portion of our revenue from the sale of blue and green led chips and packaged leds of all colors  including white 
materials products 
these products include our sic and gan wafers which are used in manufacturing leds  radio frequency  or rf  devices  and power devices and for research and development 
they also include sic material in bulk crystal form  which is used in gemstone applications 
high power products 
these products include power switching devices made from sic  which provide faster switching speeds than comparable silicon based power devices  and also include wide bandgap rf and microwave devices made from sic or gan  which allow for higher power densities as compared to gallium arsenide 
contracts with government agencies 
government agencies provide us with funding to support the development of primarily sic and gan based new technology 
industry dynamics our business is primarily focused on selling high brightness led products 
industry factors affecting our business include overall demand in products using high brightness leds  an intense and constantly evolving competitive environment  and intellectual property issues 
average led sales prices generally decline each year as market players implement pricing strategies to gain or protect market share 
to remain competitive  led producers generally must increase product performance and reduce costs to support lower average sales prices 
the led high brightness segment has become more competitive over the last several quarters  which has caused companies to lower prices at a faster rate than previously anticipated 
fiscal highlights the following is a summary of our financial results for the year ended june  our revenue from continuing operations was million 
increased sales of our high brightness packaged products and our material and high power products partially offset a reduction in revenue due to competitive pricing pressures in our led chip business 
our gross margin was of revenue  which reflected the competitive environment for our led chips and the manufacturing start up costs for our xlamp and high power product lines 
we reported consolidated net income of million and net income per diluted share of 
combined cash and investments totaled million at june  on july   we acquired intrinsic 
the technology we acquired enabled us to accelerate the commercialization of low defect substrates 
on march   we completed the acquisition of cotco  a leading supplier of high brightness led components in china 

table of contents outlook for fiscal we project that the led chip market will remain highly competitive during fiscal we plan to continue to expand our global sales  marketing  and distribution capabilities to support increased sales of our new led components  including the product lines resulting from our acquisition of cotco 
in fiscal  we plan to work on increasing the brightness of our led chips and packaged led products 
we plan to continue our work on the integration of cotco by expanding our product offerings and customer base 
we plan to continue cost reduction initiatives for both our led and sic based high power products by converting some production to four inch wafers and transferring more of our production to our contract manufacturers in asia 
in addition  we target to invest a total of million to million in capital expenditures during fiscal this will support unit volume growth and is a critical part of our overall product cost reduction initiatives 
we plan to continue to evaluate strategic investments to expand and strengthen our technology and product portfolio as well as to increase access to our targeted markets 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
in preparing our financial statements  we must make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
we base our assumptions  estimates and judgments on historical experience  current trends and other factors that management believes to be relevant at the time the consolidated financial statements are prepared 
on a regular basis  management reviews our accounting policies  assumptions  estimates and judgments to ensure that our consolidated financial statements are presented fairly and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
however  because future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results could differ from our assumptions and estimates  and we may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
our significant accounting policies are discussed in note  summary of significant accounting policies and other matters  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in
