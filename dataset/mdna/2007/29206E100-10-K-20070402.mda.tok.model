our business we are engaged in the purchase  sale and distribution of principally semi finished aluminum products to a diverse customer base located throughout the united states and canada  australia  europe  and new zealand 
we sell our products through our own marketing and sales personnel and our independent sales agents located in north america and europe who receive commissions on sales 
we purchase our products from suppliers located throughout the world 
one supplier  hulett aluminium ltd  furnished approximately of our products in we do not typically purchase inventory for stock 
instead  we place orders with our suppliers based upon orders that we have received from our customers 
critical accounting policies and estimates the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
certain accounting policies have a significant impact on amounts reported in our financial statements 
a summary of those significant accounting policies can be found in note b to our financial statements 
among the significant judgments made by management in the preparation of our financial statements are the determination of the allowance for doubtful accounts and accruals for inventory claims 
allowance for doubtful account as of december   we had  in trade receivables including an allowance for doubtful accounts of  we report accounts receivable  net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  to represent our estimate of the amount that ultimately will be realized in cash 
we review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis  using historical collection trends  aging of receivables  as well as review of specific accounts  and makes adjustments in the allowance as we believe necessary 
we maintain a credit insurance policy on the majority of our customers 
in general  this policy has a co insurance  however there are some instances where the co insurance may vary and instances where we may exceed the insured values 
changes in economic conditions could have an impact on the collection of existing receivable balances or future allowance considerations 
in addition  changes in the credit insurance environment could affect the availability of credit insurance and our ability to secure the same 
accruals for inventory claims generally  our exposure on claims for defective material is small as we refer all claims on defects back to the mill supplying the material 
if we do not believe the mill will honor a claim  we will record an allowance for inventory adjustments 
results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december  and in thousands our business in was characterized by strong revenues albeit at lower gross margins 
our business was negatively impacted by various factors including increased competition from local mills and the decline in the value of the us dollar against certain other world currencies  and this weakened our negotiating position with several of our suppliers 
our business has benefited from continued customer satisfaction  supplier and customer loyalty and the ability to manage the competitive economic environment through the expansion and upgrading of our service to our suppliers and customers 
this includes our ability to ship material on a just in time basis from both private and public warehouses  and our use of proprietary on line service modules for customers to track their shipments 
we have also used our customer relationships to leverage sales per employee by developing long term relationships with our customers and understanding their needs 
during  our net sales increased by  to  or above net sales in the increase in net sales was largely due to increases in the prices of products and the steady availability of supply shipments from our existing supplier base 
our top ten customers represented of the sales in  compared to in our gross profit margin increased by  from  to  or a increase over this was a smaller increase than our sales growth  as we experienced margin compression which was due to a number of factors  including but not limited to increased domestic competition 
our sales volume has been  and will continue to be  a function of our ongoing ability to secure quality aluminum products from our suppliers 
while we maintain long term supply relationships with several foreign mills  one supplier accounted for approximately of our purchases for the year ended december   and our three largest suppliers accounted for of purchases 
as a result  the termination or limitation by one or more of our largest suppliers of their relationship with us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our inventory increased by  to  during as compared to inventory of  in this increase in inventory supported our increased sales and it allowed us to be increasingly sensitive to timely shipments to our customers 
as a result of the increased inventory on hand  we were able to extend our customer service efforts by allowing additional time to stage material in our private or public warehouses to suit our customers needs 
our net income for the year declined by from net income for was  compared with net income for of  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by primarily as a result of increased payroll costs in empire resources  inc  as well as payroll and other costs for our subsidiaries  empire resources extrusions and imbali metals bvba 
in  our interest expense increased by  to  or above interest expense in this is a result of rising interest rates and loan balances that have increased by from to to support increased sales  and required inventory 
the increasing interest rate environment could continue to adversely affect our profitability 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and in thousands our success during was in part due to continued customer satisfaction  supplier and customer loyalty and the ability to manage the competitive economic environment through the expansion and upgrading of our service to our suppliers and customers 
this includes the ability to ship material on a just in time basis from both private and public warehouses  and the use of proprietary online service modules for customers to track their shipments 
this bolstered our commitment to service and customer satisfaction 
we have also used our excellent customer relationships to leverage sales per employee by developing long term relationships with our customers and understanding their needs 
in addition  due in part to our long term customers  we have been able to build sales volume without a similar increase in selling  general and administrative expenses that would otherwise accompany customer turn over 
our supply arrangements have also enabled us to benefit from the increased and steady availability of products from key suppliers 
our stable customer and supplier base has also enabled us to increase our purchases from our suppliers and to sell the majority of these quantities to our existing customer base 
while this does expose us to concentration risks  it has provided the foundation of our growth and performance 
our substantial increase in sales during was due to higher aluminum pricing  and to an increase of approximately in volumes shipped to our customers 
during  our net sales increased by  to  or above net sales in the increase in net sales was primarily due to increases in the prices of products and the steady availability of supply shipments from our existing supplier base 
our top ten customers represented of the sales in  compared to in our sales volume has been  and will continue to be  a function of our ongoing ability to secure quality aluminum products from our suppliers 
while we maintain long term supply relationships with several foreign mills  one supplier accounted for approximately of our purchases for the year ended december   and the three largest suppliers accounted for of purchases 
as a result  the termination or limitation by one or more of our largest suppliers of their relationship with us could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our inventory increased by  to  during as compared to inventory of  in this increase in inventory supported our increased sales and it allowed us to be increasingly sensitive to timely shipments to our customers 
as a result of the increased inventory on hand  we were able to extend our customer service efforts by allowing additional time to stage material in our private or public warehouses to serve our customers needs 
our net income grew during this same period by 
net income for was  compared with net income for of  we did not have to increase selling  general and administrative expenses by the same percentage as our sales increased  in large part through the use of long term planning  customer relationships  and technology 
in  our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by  to  or above selling  general and administrative expenses in our strategy of maintaining long term relationships with our customers  while allowing for sales growth  also exposes us to concentration risks 
in  our interest expense increased by  to  or above interest expense in this is a result of rising interest rates and loan balances that have doubled from to to support increased sales and required inventory 
the increasing interest rates could adversely affect our profitability 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands our cash balance decreased by in the year ended december  net cash of  was used in operating activities  while  of net cash was provided by financing activities  specifically proceeds of loans from banks 
increases in accounts receivable and inventories at year end were the most significant contributor to the increased use of cash 
both of these increases support the increased shipments 
on june  we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with five commercial banks 
jpmorgan chase bank  na acted as the agent for the lenders and they were joined by rabobank international  new york branch  citicorp usa  inc  brown brothers harriman co  and fortis capital corp 
in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  including a commitment to issue letters of credit and a swing line loan sub facility 
the credit agreement provides that amounts under the facility may be borrowed and repaid  and re borrowed  subject to a borrowing base test  until the maturity date of june  as of december  the credit utilized amounted to  including  of outstanding letters of credit 
amounts borrowed by the company bear interest of eurodollar  money market  or base rates  at the company s option  plus an applicable margin 
the applicable margin is determined by our leverage ratios 
borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by security interests in substantially all of our assets 
the credit agreement contains financial and other covenants including but not limited to  covenants requiring maintenance of minimum tangible net worth and compliance with leverage ratios  as well as an ownership minimum and limitations on other indebtedness  liens  and investments and dispositions of assets 
in connection with the revolving line of credit  we are a party to interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million terminating in these swaps are designated as a cash flow hedge of the variable interest on that portion of the credit agreement up to the notional amount 
we will pay a fixed rate of plus a spread to the bank  and in return the bank will pay us floating libor rate plus a spread 
this floating rate will reset monthly 
in addition  we are a party to a mortgage and an interest rate swap that we entered into in in connection with the purchase of our baltimore warehouse 
the mortgage loan  which had an outstanding balance of million at september  and million at december   requires monthly payments of approximately  including interest at libor  and matures in december under the related interest rate swap  which has been designated as a cash flow hedge and remains effective through the maturity of the mortgage loan  we will pay a monthly fixed interest rate of to the counterparty bank on a notional principal equal to the outstanding principal balance of the mortgage 
in return  the bank will pay us a floating rate  namely  libor  to reset monthly  plus on the same notional principal amount 
management believes that cash from operations  together with funds available under our credit facility  will be sufficient to fund the cash requirements relating to our existing operations 
we may require additional debt or equity financing in connection with the future expansion of our operations 
the table below provides a summary of our commitments and contractual obligations arrangements as of december  commitments and contingencies in thousands total less than years years more than year years bank debt  operating leases  letters of credit  total  we have contingent liabilities in the form of letters of credit to some of our suppliers 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use financial instruments designated as fair value hedges to manage our exposure to commodity price risk and foreign currency exchange risk inherent in our trading activities 
it is our policy to hedge such risks  to the extent practicable 
we enter into high grade aluminum futures contracts to limit our gross margin exposure by hedging the metals content element of firmly committed purchase and sales commitments 
in cases where we enter into fixed price contracts with our suppliers and variable priced sales with our customers  we will utilize the futures market to match the terms of the purchase and sale 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge our exposure related to commitments to purchase or sell non ferrous metals denominated in international currencies 
in situations where we enter into purchase or sales denominated in foreign currency  the foreign exchange market will be utilized to hedge foreign exchange risk exposure 
we record mark to market adjustments on these futures and forward positions  and on the underlying firm purchase and sales commitments which they hedge  and reflect the net gains and losses currently in earnings 
at december  net unrealized loss on the company s foreign exchange forward contracts amounted to approximately  as of december  net unrealized gain on the company s foreign exchange was  net realized and unrealized losses on aluminum futures contracts at december  and amounted to approximately  and  respectively 
these amounts  which represent the fair value of the derivative contracts  were offset by like amounts for the changes in the fair value of inventories and commitments which were hedged 
in  such amounts are reflected in the accompanying balance sheet in inventory  and derivative liabilities 
in such amounts are reflected in the accompanying balance sheet in inventory  and derivative liabilities
