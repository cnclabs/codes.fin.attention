item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview financial federal corporation is an independent financial services company operating in the united states through three wholly owned subsidiaries 
we do not have any unconsolidated subsidiaries  partnerships or joint ventures 
we also do not have any off balance sheet assets or liabilities other than commitments to extend credit  goodwill  other intangible assets or pension obligations  and we are not involved in income tax shelters 
we have one fully consolidated special purpose entity we established for our on balance sheet asset securitization facility 
we have one line of business 
we lend money under installment sale agreements  secured loans and leases collectively referred to as finance receivables to small and medium sized businesses for their equipment financing needs 
finance receivable transactions generally range between  and million  have terms generally ranging between two and five years and provide for monthly payments 
the average transaction size is approximately  we earn revenue solely from interest and other fees and amounts earned on our finance receivables 
we need to borrow most of the money we lend  therefore liquidity money currently available for us to borrow is important 
we borrow from banks and insurance companies and we issue commercial paper to other investors 
approximately of our finance receivables were funded with debt at july  we focus on i maximizing the difference between the rates we earn on our receivables and the rates we incur on our debt net interest spread ii maintaining the asset quality of our receivables and iii managing our interest rate risk 
interest rates on our finance receivables were fixed and floating  and interest rates on our debt were fixed and floating at july  therefore  changes in market interest rates affect our profitability significantly 
the asset quality of our finance receivables can also affect our profitability significantly 
asset quality can affect finance income  provisions for credit losses and operating expenses through reclassifying receivables to or from non accrual status  incurring write downs and incurring costs associated with non performing assets 
we use various strategies to manage our interest rate risk and credit risk 
our main areas of focus are asset quality  liquidity and interest rate risk 
we discuss each in detail in separate sections of this discussion 
these areas are integral to our long term profitability 
our key operating statistics are net charge offs  loss ratio  non performing assets  delinquencies  receivables growth  leverage  available liquidity  net interest margin and net interest spread  and expense and efficiency ratios 
significant events we repurchased million shares of our common stock in fiscal for million paying a average price per share and we established a new million common stock and convertible debt repurchase program in fiscal we also increased the amount available under our former repurchase program by million 
the shares repurchased were of total shares outstanding and increased our leverage to from this is discussed further in the liquidity and capital resources section 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting principles generally accepted in the united states require judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
in note to the consolidated financial statements  we describe the significant accounting policies and methods we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
accounting policies involving significant judgment  assumptions and estimates are considered critical accounting policies and are described below 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses on finance receivables is our estimate of losses inherent in our finance receivables at the balance sheet date 
the allowance is difficult to determine and requires significant judgment 
the allowance is based on total finance receivables  net charge off experience  non accrual and delinquent finance receivables and our current assessment of the risks inherent in our finance receivables from national and regional economic conditions  industry conditions  concentrations  the financial condition of customers and guarantors  collateral values and other factors 
we may need to change the allowance level significantly if unexpected changes in these conditions or factors occur 
increases in the allowance would reduce net income through higher provisions for credit losses 
the allowance was million of finance receivables at july  including million specifically allocated to impaired receivables 
the allowance includes amounts specifically allocated to impaired receivables and an amount to provide for losses inherent in the remainder of finance receivables the general allowance 
we evaluate the fair value of an impaired receivable and compare it to the carrying amount 
the carrying amount is the amount the receivable is recorded at when we evaluate the receivable and may include a prior write down or specific allowance 
if our estimate of fair value is lower than the carrying amount  we record a write down or establish a specific allowance depending on i how we determined fair value ii how certain we are of our estimate and iii the level and type of factors and items other than the primary collateral  such as guarantees and secondary collateral  supporting our fair value estimate 
to estimate the general allowance  we analyze historical write down activity to develop percentage loss ranges by risk profile 
risk profiles are assigned to receivables based on past due status and the customers industry 
we then adjust the calculated range of losses for expected recoveries and we may also adjust the range for differences between current and historical loss trends and other factors to arrive at the estimated allowance 
we record a provision for credit losses if the recorded allowance differs from our current estimate 
although our method is designed to calculate probable losses  because significant estimates are used  the adjusted calculated range of losses may differ from actual losses significantly 
non performing assets we record non accrual impaired finance receivables at their current estimated fair value if less than their carrying amount 
we record repossessed equipment assets received to satisfy receivables at their current estimated fair value less selling costs if less than their carrying amount 
we estimate fair value of these non performing assets by evaluating the expected cash flows of impaired receivables and the market value and condition of the collateral or assets 
we evaluate market value based on recent sales of similar equipment  used equipment publications  our market knowledge and information from equipment vendors 
unexpected adverse changes in or incorrect estimates of expected cash flows  market value or the condition of collateral or assets  or time needed to sell the equipment would require us to record a write down 
this would lower net income 
non performing assets totaled million of finance receivables at july  residual values we record residual values on direct financing leases at the lowest of i any stated purchase option ii the present value at the end of the initial lease term of rentals due under any renewal options or iii our projection of the equipment s fair value at the end of the lease 
we may not fully realize recorded residual values because of unexpected adverse changes in or incorrect projections of future equipment values 
this would lower net income 
residual values totaled million of finance receivables at july  historically  we have realized the recorded residual value on disposition 
stock based compensation we record compensation expense for stock options under sfas no 
r using the black scholes option pricing model 
this model requires us to estimate the expected volatility of the price of our common stock  the expected life of options and the expected dividend rate 
sfas no 
r also requires us to estimate forfeitures of stock awards 
estimating volatility  expected life  dividend rate and forfeitures requires significant judgment and an analysis of historical data 
if actual results differ from our estimates significantly  compensation expense for options and shares of restricted stock and our results of operations could be impacted materially

we did not need to increase the allowance because of continued low net charge offs and continued strong asset quality  and we did not need to reduce it because of receivables growth 
net charge offs write downs of finance receivables less recoveries were  in fiscal and  in fiscal  and the loss ratio net charge offs expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables was less than in fiscal and fiscal salaries and other expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from fewer recoveries of costs associated with non performing assets and higher salary expense 
salary expense increased because of higher salaries 
the expense ratio salaries and other expenses expressed as a percentage of average finance receivables improved to in fiscal from in fiscal because the percentage increase in average receivables exceeded the percentage increase in expenses 
the efficiency ratio expense ratio expressed as a percentage of net interest margin improved to in fiscal from in fiscal because the percentage increase in net finance income before provision for credit losses exceeded the percentage increase in expenses 
the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in income before income taxes  partially offset by the decrease in our effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal our effective tax rate decreased because of the new texas income tax law effective for fiscal and the overall decrease in our state effective income tax rate

increases in short term market interest rates  partially offset by the lower weighted average rate on our fixed rate term debt and lower credit spreads the difference between the interest rates on our debt and the underlying market interest rates raised our cost of debt to in fiscal from in fiscal net finance income before provision for credit losses on finance receivables increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net interest margin decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal because of the significant increase in short term market interest rates 
we did not record a provision for credit losses on finance receivables in fiscal because of low net charge offs  continued strong asset quality and receivables growth 
the provision was million in fiscal we did not need to increase the allowance because of the low amount of net charge offs and continued strong asset quality  and we did not need to reduce it because of the significant growth in receivables 
net charge offs decreased to  in fiscal from million in fiscal the loss ratio decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal net charge offs decreased because of significantly fewer non accrual receivables 
salaries and other expenses increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from increased salary expense and  to a lesser extent  general increases in other operating expenses from strong receivables growth  partially offset by cost savings from significantly fewer non performing assets 
salary expense increased because of higher salaries  an increase in the number of employees and because sfas no 
r required us to record million of compensation expense for stock options in fiscal the expense ratio improved to in fiscal from in fiscal because the rate of receivables growth exceeded the percentage increase in expenses 
the efficiency ratio improved to in fiscal from in fiscal because the percentage increase in net finance income exceeded the percentage increase in expenses 
the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted from the increase in income before income taxes  and to a lesser extent  the slight increase in our effective tax rate to in fiscal from in fiscal our effective tax rate increased because tax benefits reductions of the provision for income taxes cannot be recorded on the million of expense for incentive stock options not exercised and not sold in fiscal this was partially offset by the  tax benefit we recorded from the change in texas tax law enacted in our fourth quarter of fiscal our fiscal effective tax rate would have been excluding the effects of these two items 
diluted earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal  and basic earnings per share increased by to per share in fiscal from per share in fiscal the percentage increases in diluted and basic earnings per share were lower than the percentage increase in net income because the average price of our common stock was higher in fiscal and there were more shares of common stock outstanding in fiscal from stock option exercises and awards of restricted stock

r reduced net income by million  reduced diluted earnings per share by and reduced basic earnings per share by in fiscal finance receivables and asset quality we discuss trends and characteristics of our finance receivables and our approach to managing credit risk in this section 
the key aspect is asset quality 
asset quality statistics measure our underwriting standards  skills and policies and procedures and can indicate the direction and levels of future net charge offs and non performing assets

as of and for the year ended finance receivables grew million during fiscal to billion at july  from billion at july  finance receivables comprise installment sale agreements and secured loans collectively referred to as loans and direct financing leases 
loans were billion of finance receivables and leases were million at july  finance receivables originated in fiscal and were billion and billion  respectively 
originations decreased because the strong demand for equipment financing eased due to general economic conditions and because the trucking industry is experiencing a significant slowdown in sales of heavy duty trucks 
finance receivables collected in fiscal and were billion and million  respectively 
collections increased because of higher average finance receivables 
our primary focus is the credit quality of our receivables 
we manage our credit risk by using disciplined and sound underwriting policies and procedures  by monitoring our receivables closely and by handling non performing accounts effectively 
our underwriting policies and procedures require a first lien on equipment financed 
we focus on financing equipment with a remaining useful life longer than the term financed  historically low levels of technological obsolescence  use in more than one type of business  ease of access and transporting  and broad  established resale markets 
securing our receivables with equipment possessing these characteristics can mitigate potential net charge offs 
we may also obtain additional equipment or other collateral  third party guarantees  advance payments or hold back a portion of the amount financed 
we do not finance or lease aircraft or railcars  computer related equipment  telecommunications equipment or equipment located outside the united states  and we do not lend to consumers 
our underwriting policies limit our credit exposure with any customer 
the limit was million at july  our ten largest customers accounted for million of total finance receivables at july  our allowance for credit losses was million at july  and million at july  the allowance level declined to of finance receivables at july  from at july  because of continued low net charge offs  favorable asset quality and receivables growth 
we determine the allowance quarterly based on our analysis of historical losses and the past due status of receivables adjusted for expected recoveries and any differences between current and historical loss trends and other factors 
net charge offs of finance receivables write downs less recoveries were  in fiscal and  in fiscal and the loss ratios were 
net charge offs remained low because of low non performing assets 
the net investments in non accrual impaired finance receivables  repossessed equipment assets received to satisfy receivables  total non performing assets and delinquent finance receivables transactions with more than a nominal portion of a contractual payment or more days past due follow in millions july  non accrual finance receivables repossessed equipment total non performing assets delinquent finance receivables percentage of non accrual receivables not delinquent before specifically allocated allowance of million at july  and million at july  delinquent receivables  non accrual receivables and repossessed equipment increased during fiscal but are still at favorable levels 
we expect continued moderate increases in these amounts 
also  because our asset quality statistics remained below expected levels  they could worsen significantly if receivables from our larger customers become delinquent  impaired or repossessed even though the overall trend may remain positive 
our finance receivables reflect industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk 
these concentrations result from customers having similar economic characteristics that could cause their ability to repay us to be similarly affected by changes in economic or other conditions 
at july   our industry concentrations were construction related  road transportation and refuse and our us regional geographic concentrations were southwest  southeast  northeast  west and central 
liquidity and capital resources we describe our need for raising capital debt and equity  our need for a substantial amount of liquidity money currently available for us to borrow  our approach to managing liquidity and our current funding sources in this section 
key indicators are leverage the number of times debt exceeds equity  available liquidity  credit ratings and debt diversification 
our leverage is low for a finance company  we have been successful in issuing debt  we have ample liquidity available and our debt is diversified with maturities staggered over seven years 
liquidity and access to capital are vital to our operations and growth 
we need continued availability of funds to originate or acquire finance receivables and to repay debt 
to ensure we have enough liquidity  we project our financing needs based on estimated receivables growth and maturing debt  we monitor capital markets closely and we diversify our funding sources 
funding sources available to us include operating cash flow  private and public issuances of term debt  conduit and term securitizations of finance receivables  committed unsecured revolving bank credit facilities  dealer placed and direct issued commercial paper and sales of common and preferred equity 
we believe our liquidity sources are diversified  and we are not dependent on any funding source or provider 
our term notes are rated bbb by fitch ratings  inc fitch  a nationally recognized statistical ratings organization and our commercial paper is rated f by fitch 
as a condition of our f credit rating  commercial paper outstanding is limited to the unused amount of our bank credit facilities 
fitch affirmed its investment grade ratings on our debt in january and maintained its stable outlook 
our access to capital markets and our credit spreads are partly dependent on these investment grade credit ratings 
we had million available to borrow under our bank credit facilities after subtracting commercial paper outstanding at july  our asset securitization facility could also be increased by million and we believe we can issue more term notes 
we believe  but cannot assure  sufficient capital is available to us to sustain our future operations and growth 
our major operating subsidiary s debt agreements have restrictive covenants including limits on its indebtedness  encumbrances  investments  dividends and other distributions to us  sales of assets  mergers and other business combinations  capital expenditures  interest coverage and net worth 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants and restrictions at july  none of the agreements have a material adverse change clause 
debt increased by million to billion at july  from billion at july  and stockholders equity decreased by million to million at july  from million at july  because we repurchased million of common stock in fiscal therefore  leverage debt to equity ratio increased to at july  from at july  our leverage is still considered low allowing for substantial asset growth and additional equity repurchases 
historically  our leverage has not exceeded which is also considered low for a finance company

term notes we issued million of fixed rate term notes in april the notes comprise million of five year  notes and million of seven year  notes due at maturity in april and we will pay interest semiannually 
we repaid bank and securitization borrowings and repurchased common stock with the proceeds 
we repaid million of term notes at maturity with fixed rates ranging from and and we converted a million floating rate term note due in fiscal to a million three year committed unsecured revolving bank credit facility in fiscal asset securitization financings we have a million asset securitization facility 
we established the facility in july the facility provides for committed revolving financing for one year 
the facility was renewed a sixth time in april and expires in april if the facility is not renewed again  we could convert borrowings into term debt 
the term debt would be repaid monthly from collections of securitized receivables and would be repaid by february based on the contractual payments of the million of securitized receivables at july  borrowings under the facility are limited to of eligible securitized receivables 
securitized receivables ninety or more days past due  classified as impaired or subject to a bankruptcy  or whose terms are outside of defined limits  are ineligible to be borrowed against 
the facility also restricts the amount of net charge offs of securitized receivables and the amount of delinquent securitized receivables 
the facility would terminate if these restrictions are exceeded  and borrowings outstanding would then be repaid monthly from collections of securitized receivables 
the unsecured debt agreements of our major operating subsidiary allow of its finance receivables to be securitized million at july  
therefore  we could securitize an additional million of finance receivables at july  convertible debentures the debentures are due at maturity in april  but we can redeem them anytime starting in april by paying the principal amount in cash and debenture holders can require us to repurchase them on each five year anniversary of issuance or when a specified corporate transaction occurs by paying the principal amount in cash 
debenture holders can also convert the debentures into cash and common stock before maturity as discussed below 
the market value of the debentures was of their principal amount at july  the debentures can only be converted i in any fiscal quarter when the closing price of our common stock is at least higher than the conversion price for at least of the last trading days of the prior fiscal quarter the market price condition ii if the debentures are rated bb or lower by fitch three ratings levels lower than the initial rating iii if we call the debentures for redemption or iv if a specified corporate transaction occurs 
no event allowing for the debentures to be converted has occurred through july  the market price condition would have been met at july  if the price of our common stock closed above for the required period 
the closing price of our common stock was on july  the debentures can only convert into shares of our common stock when their value exceeds their principal amount because we irrevocably elected in fiscal to pay the value of converted debentures  not exceeding the principal amount  in cash instead of issuing shares of our common stock 
their value equals the number of convertible shares multiplied by the market value of our common stock 
there are million convertible but not issuable shares  the adjusted conversion price is per share and the adjusted conversion rate is shares for each  of principal 
if the value of converted debentures exceeds their principal amount  shares of common stock needed to pay the value over principal would equal the difference between the conversion date price of our common stock and the conversion price  divided by the conversion date price and multiplied by the number of convertible shares 
the conversion rate and number of convertible shares increase and the conversion price decreases when we pay dividends on our common stock 
bank credit facilities we have million of committed unsecured revolving credit facilities from eleven banks a million increase from july  
this includes million of facilities with original terms ranging from two to five years and million of facilities with an original term of one year 
these facilities range from million to million 
in fiscal  million of one year facilities were converted into multi year facilities 
borrowings under these facilities can mature between and days 
borrowings outstanding at july  matured august  the multi year facilities expire as follows in millions fiscal these committed facilities are a low cost source of funds and support our commercial paper program 
we can borrow the full amount under each facility 
none of the facilities are for commercial paper back up only and the facilities do not have usage fees 
these facilities may be renewed  extended or increased before they expire 
bank credit facility activity is summarized below in millions years ended july  amount of banks amount of banks total beginning of year new expired not renewed increased total end of year renewed at expiration term extended before expiration commercial paper we issue commercial paper direct and through a million program with maturities between and days 
we increased the program in fiscal from million

stockholders equity we established a new million common stock and convertible debt repurchase program in fiscal after completing our former program 
we also increased the amount available under our former program by million in fiscal we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million at an average price of per share in fiscal under these programs 
we financed the repurchases with the proceeds from the seven year fixed rate term notes issued in april and borrowings under bank credit facilities 
we also received  shares of common stock from employees in fiscal at an average price of per share for payment of income tax we were required to withhold on vested shares of restricted stock 
we retired all shares repurchased and received in fiscal there was million available for future repurchases under the new program at july  the new program does not have a set expiration 
we paid million of cash dividends and we received million from stock option exercises and tax benefits from stock based awards in fiscal market interest rate risk and sensitivity we discuss how changes in market interest rates affect our net interest spread and how we manage interest rate risk in this section 
net interest spread net yield of finance receivables less cost of debt is an integral part of a finance company s profitability and is calculated below years ended july  net yield of finance receivables cost of debt net interest spread our net interest spread was basis points lower in fiscal compared to fiscal because the effects of increases in short term market interest rates during fiscal on our cost of debt in fiscal exceeded the increase in the net yield of finance receivables 
this is an expected result of an inverted yield curve as discussed below 
our net interest spread is sensitive to changes in short term and long term market interest rates includes libor  rates on us treasury securities  money market rates  swap rates and the prime rate 
increases in short term rates reduce our net interest spread this occurred during our prior two fiscal years and continued to affect us in fiscal and decreases in short term rates increase our net interest spread because our floating rate debt includes short term debt exceeds our floating rate finance receivables by a significant amount 
interest rates on our debt change faster than the yield on our receivables because of our debt is floating rate compared to floating rate finance receivables of only 
our net interest spread is also affected when the differences between short term and long term rates change 
long term rates normally exceed short term rates 
when this excess narrows resulting in a flattening yield curve or when short term rates exceed long term rates an inverted yield curve  our net interest spread should decrease and when the yield curve widens our net interest spread should increase because the rates we charge our customers are partially determined by long term market interest rates and rates on our floating rate debt are largely determined by short term market interest rates 
we can mitigate the effects of an inverted yield curve by issuing long term fixed rate debt 
the yield curve was inverted during most of fiscal short term market interest rates changed little in fiscal after rising substantially and consistently over the prior two years 
as a result  our cost of debt remained flat during the year 
long term market interest rates increased during the latter part of fiscal reversing the inverted yield curve 
higher long term market interest rates will increase the cost of future issuances of fixed rate term debt and could also result in higher yields on finance receivables 
our income is subject to the risk of rising short term market interest rates and a flat or inverted yield curve at july  because floating rate debt exceeded floating rate receivables by million see the table below 
the terms and prepayment experience of our fixed rate receivables mitigate this risk 
finance receivables are collected monthly over short terms of two to five years and have been accelerated by prepayments 
at july   million of fixed rate finance receivables are scheduled to be collected in one year and the weighted average remaining life of fixed rate finance receivables excluding prepayments is approximately twenty months 
historically  annual collections have exceeded of average receivables 
we do not match the maturities of our debt to our finance receivables

floating rate debt comprises asset securitization financings  commercial paper  floating rate swaps of fixed rate notes and bank borrowings  and reprices interest rate changes based on current short term market interest rates at july  as follows million within one month  million in two to three months and million in four to six months 
the repricing frequency of floating rate debt follows in millions amount repricing frequency asset securitization financings generally daily commercial paper to days day average floating rate swaps of fixed rate notes semiannually day average bank borrowings generally daily we quantify interest rate risk by calculating the effect on net income of a hypothetical  immediate basis point rise in market interest rates 
this hypothetical change in rates would reduce annual net income by approximately million at july  based on scheduled repricings of floating rate debt  fixed rate debt maturing within one year and the expected effects on the yield of new receivables 
this amount increases to million excluding the expected increase in the yield of new receivables 
we believe these amounts are acceptable considering the cost of floating rate debt has been historically lower than fixed rate debt 
these hypothetical reductions of annual net income at july  were million or million 
actual future changes in market interest rates and the effect on net income may differ materially from these amounts 
other factors that may accompany an actual immediate basis point rise in market interest rates were not considered in the calculation 
we monitor and manage our exposure to potential adverse changes in market interest rates with derivative financial instruments and by changing the proportion of our fixed and floating rate debt 
we may use derivatives to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk on existing debt and debt expected to be issued 
we do not speculate with or trade derivatives 
we entered into interest rate locks in the form of forward starting interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million with three banks in september the rate locks had a march expiration 
we designated the rate locks as cash flow hedges of our anticipated issuance of fixed rate term notes hedging the risk of higher interest payments on the notes for the first five years from increases in market interest rates before the notes were issued 
we received million when we terminated the rate locks in january we entered into another interest rate lock also a forward starting interest rate swap with a notional amount of million with a bank in march with an april expiration 
we designated it as a cash flow hedge of the same anticipated fixed rate term notes issuance originally hedged in september we hedged these notes again because applicable market interest rates declined more than basis points after we terminated the initial rate locks 
we terminated this rate lock in april when the hedged notes were issued and we received  all of the rate locks were determined to be highly effective 
the amount of the gains on these rate locks relating to hedge ineffectiveness was  we recorded this amount as a reduction of interest expense in fiscal we recorded the million effective amount of these gains in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income net of deferred income tax of million 
we are reclassifying this after tax amount into net income over five years the term of the notes issued by reducing interest expense and deferred income tax 
these rate locks effectively lowered the interest rate on the fixed rate notes issued in april by basis points 
we also have fixed to floating interest rate swaps with a total notional amount of million at july  and the swaps effectively convert fixed rate term notes into floating rate term notes 
semiannually  we receive fixed amounts from the swap counterparty banks equal to the interest we pay on the hedged fixed rate notes  and we pay amounts to the swap counterparty banks equal to the swaps floating rates multiplied by the swaps notional amounts 
the swaps floating rates change semiannually to a fixed amount over six month libor at july  
the swaps increased interest expense by million in fiscal and by million in fiscal the weighted average pay rate of at july  exceeded the weighted average receive rate by basis points
