item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations fiscal year our fiscal year is from november to october unless otherwise stated  references to the years   and relate to the fiscal years ended october    and  respectively 
references to future years also relate to our fiscal year ending october critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses 
we continually evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  and have identified the policies relating to the following areas as those that are significant to our financial statement presentation  and require difficult  subjective  or complex judgments revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts capitalized product development costs valuation of our deferred income taxes valuation and impairment analysis of goodwill and identified intangible assets our discussion of these policies is intended to supplement  but not replace  the more detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies and disclosures contained in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policy is considered critical for several reasons 
revenue recognition rules for software companies are complex  can involve significant judgment  and can vary across the variety of products and services we offer 
as a result  revenue results can be difficult to predict and any delay in recognizing revenue could cause our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we follow specific and detailed guidelines in determining the proper amount of revenue to be recorded 
in general  revenue from the sale of courseware licenses is recognized when all of the following conditions are met i a written customer order has been executed  ii courseware has been delivered  iii the license fee is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility of the fee is probable 
certain judgments can affect how these specific rules are applied to individual transactions 
these judgments typically involve whether collectibility can be considered probable and whether fees are fixed or determinable 
provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  if collectibility of the fee is not probable  revenue is not recognized until payments are received  or  if the fee due from the customer is not fixed or determinable  revenue is not recognized until the payments become due 
in  we implemented a policy which requires  in most instances  that a purchase order signed by the customer be received by us prior to the recognition of revenue 
we believe this policy change has reduced the level of judgment with respect to these revenue recognition criteria 

table of contents our transactions often consist of multiple element  or bundled  arrangements 
software revenue recognition rules require that these orders be analyzed to determine the relative fair value of each bundled element  the amount of revenue to be recognized upon shipment  if any  and the period and conditions under which deferred revenue should be recognized 
in addition to providing our courseware licenses on a one time  perpetual license basis  certain courseware is also provided on a subscription basis 
revenues from products sold on a subscription basis are initially recorded as deferred revenue on our balance sheet and then recognized as revenue ratably over the subscription period 
we also provide professional services related to our products  including consulting  training  and implementation services  as well as ongoing software support and maintenance 
consulting  training  and implementation services are not essential to the functionality of our software products 
accordingly  revenues from these services are recognized separately 
software support and maintenance is recognized ratably over the support period  and consulting  training and implementation services are recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon an analysis of the collectibility of specific accounts  historical experience  and the aging of our trade and installment accounts receivable 
bad debt expense is included in general and administrative expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
the assumptions and estimates used to determine the allowance are subject to revision and can involve significant judgment 
the primary factors that impact these assumptions include our credit assessment process  our historical experience  and the efficiency and effectiveness of our billing and collection functions 
in  we significantly reduced the variety of payment terms offered to our customers and implemented credit and other policies which had the effect of significantly reducing our bad debt exposure 
capitalized product development costs 
our investments in product development are significant  and the rules that govern how these costs are accounted for in our financial statements can have a significant impact on our operating results from period to period 
our product development activities relate to the research  development  enhancement  and maintenance of our software products 
costs related to the initial design and development of new products and the routine enhancement and maintenance of existing products are expensed as incurred 
when projects reach technological feasibility we begin capitalization of the related project costs 
capitalization ends when a product is available for general release to our customers  at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins 
a significant portion of our product development costs qualify for capitalization due to the concentration of our development efforts on the content of our courseware 
the amortization of these costs is included in cost of revenues related to license fees and subscriptions 
we evaluate our capitalized costs on a quarterly basis to determine if the unamortized balance related to any product  or group of products  exceeds its estimated net realizable value 
estimating net realizable value requires us to use judgment in projecting future revenues and cash flows to be generated by the product and thereby quantifying the amount  if any  to be written off 
actual cash flows realized could differ materially from those estimated 
in addition  any future changes to our software product offerings could result in write offs of previously capitalized costs and have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations 
our analysis as of october  resulted in an impairment charge of these assets of million 
our analysis as of october  did not result in an impairment charge 

table of contents in the third quarter of  we changed our estimate of the useful lives of platform  math and science products released after the second quarter from three years to four years on the basis that these products are projected to have longer useful lives 
all other product amortization periods have remained at three years 
the effect of the policy change on our results was not material  but it could be material in the future as we expect platform  math  and science products to continue to be a significant portion of our capitalized product development spending going forward 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
our accounting policy for the valuation of deferred income taxes is considered critical for several reasons 
significant judgment is required in the assessment of the need for a valuation allowance 
in addition  income tax accounting rules  in combination with purchase accounting rules applied in the acquisition of lightspan in  result in a complex tax accounting situation in which we currently do not recognize tax benefits on operating losses or on the realization of deferred tax assets  but regardless of our operating results  recognize tax expense on future tax liabilities related to tax deductible goodwill 
the majority of our deferred tax assets represent net operating loss carryforwards which are available to offset future taxable income 
these loss carryforwards include those acquired in the acquisition of lightspan in  as well as carryforward losses that existed prior to  or were incurred after the acquisition 
our ability to realize the benefit of these loss carryforwards is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
at the time of the acquisition  our history of cumulative operating losses  including those at lightspan prior to the acquisition  was evidence that we would not be able to generate sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of carryforward losses 
as a result  our deferred tax assets were fully reserved at that time and  under purchase accounting rules  the write off was recorded as an increase to goodwill 
because we do not expect to be profitable in  our deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved at october  excluded from our calculation of net deferred tax assets is a deferred tax liability related to tax deductible goodwill 
the timing of the reversal of this difference is considered indefinite because it will not reverse until the underlying assets that created the goodwill are disposed of or sold 
accordingly  this timing difference cannot be used to support the realization of other deferred tax assets which have definite lives 
our net deferred tax assets will remain fully reserved until the related tax benefits are realized through the generation of taxable income in a particular year  or until we can demonstrate a history of generating taxable income 
in either case  the related tax benefits will not be recorded as an income tax benefit in the consolidated statements of operations until the portion of deferred tax assets that resulted in an increase to goodwill is fully realized 
goodwill and identified intangible assets 
goodwill and identified intangible assets are recorded when the purchase price paid for an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the tangible assets acquired 
most of the companies we have acquired have not had significant tangible assets 
as a result  a significant portion of the purchase price paid in acquisitions has been allocated to identified intangible assets and or goodwill 
identified intangible assets are amortized to expense over their expected useful lives and goodwill is not amortized 
once established  these assets are subject to periodic impairment assessments to determine if their current carrying values are recoverable based on information available at the time these assessments are made 
significant assumptions and estimates are required in making these assessments 
accordingly  the assumptions and estimates we use in 
table of contents implementing this policy affect the amount of identified intangible asset amortization and impairment charges  if any  reflected in our operating results 
as discussed below  our impairment assessments at october  and resulted in impairment charges on identified intangible technology  trademark and customer assets acquired in previous acquisitions 
general factors affecting our financial results there are a number of general factors that affect our results from period to period 
these factors are discussed below 
revenue 
we are strategically transitioning our business model from one that emphasized the sale of one time perpetual licenses to our software  for which revenue is generally recognized up front upon delivery  to one that emphasizes the sale of subscription based products  for which revenue is recognized over the subscription period 
as a result  this transition will affect the comparability of our revenues from period to period until it is complete 
the transition became most evident in the third quarter of when many of our new subscription based products became available 
as subscription revenues grow as a percentage of total revenues  we expect our period to period revenues to become more comparable and predictable 
until our transition to subscription based products is closer to completion  a meaningful portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from perpetual licenses to our software products 
these revenues are reported as license fees in our consolidated statement of operations 
changes in the quantity and size of individual license fee transactions can have a significant impact on revenues in a period 
in addition  as is common in the software industry  a large portion of our customer orders tend to occur in the final weeks or days of each fiscal quarter 
as a result  license revenues can be heavily influenced by events such as funding approvals that may be outside our control during this short span of time 
our business is also seasonal  with the largest portion of our license fees typically coming in the third and fourth quarters of our fiscal year  and professional service fees being the greatest during periods in which schools are in session 
while this seasonality does not generally impact the comparability of our annual results  it can significantly impact our results from quarter to quarter 
gross profit 
our gross profit during a period is dependent on a number of factors 
license fee revenues have high gross profit due to the low direct cost of delivering these products 
as a result  the mix of license fee revenues to total revenues in a given period significantly influences reported total gross profit 
in addition  a large portion of our costs of revenue are fixed in nature 
these costs include amortization of capitalized software development and purchased technology  depreciation and other infrastructure costs to support our hosted subscription services  customer support operations  and full time professional services personnel who deliver our training services 
accordingly  increases in revenues allow us to leverage these costs resulting in higher gross profit  while decreases in revenues have the opposite effect 
operating expenses 
incentive compensation is a significant variable component of our sales and marketing expenses  approximating to of total revenues in any given period 
sales and marketing expenses also include costs such as travel  tradeshows  and conferences that can vary with revenue activity or individual events that occur during the period 
general and administrative expenses are substantially fixed in nature 
however  certain components such as our provision for bad debts  professional fees  and other expenses can vary based on business results  individual events  or initiatives we may be pursuing at various times throughout the year 

table of contents product maintenance and development expense in our consolidated statement of operations does not reflect our total level of spending in these areas 
costs to enhance or maintain existing products  or to develop products prior to achieving technological feasibility  are charged to product maintenance and development expense as incurred 
costs incurred to develop new products after technological feasibility is achieved  which represent the majority of our total development spending  are capitalized and amortized to cost of revenues 
accordingly  product maintenance and development expense in our consolidated statement of operations can fluctuate from period to period  in terms of both total dollars and as a percentage of revenue  based on the nature and timing of activities occurring during the period 
amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of certain identified intangible assets acquired through various acquisitions 
while these expenses are generally predictable from period to period because they are fixed over the course of their individual useful lives  they can be affected by events and other factors that result in impairment of these assets and a corresponding reduction in future amortization 
overview of financial results the transition of our company that we began in fiscal year continued in compared to fiscal  our revenues declined  to million  and our net loss decreased to million  or per share  from million  or per share 
the transition of our company began in when we took a number of significant actions to change the strategic direction of the company 
these actions included significant leadership changes across the organization  the development of a new strategic product roadmap consisting of products that will be offered only on a subscription basis and which we believe will make our product offerings the strongest in the industry  the restructuring of our sales and development organizations to align them with our new business direction  the development of the internal systems  processes  and disciplines necessary to support our long term growth plans 
in executing these actions  we incurred in non cash technology impairment charges of million  cash and non cash restructuring and other charges totaling million  and reduced our operating expenses from the continuing transition into also resulted in non cash impairment charges of million on previously acquired technology  customer and trademark intangible assets  cash restructuring charges of million  and reduced operating expenses from in  we released two important subscription based products from the roadmap that was completed in in july  we released the first phase of the plato learning environment  our online management system which will be the foundation for all new products going forward 
also in july  we released our straight curve elementary math product which represents our first product designed to be used as supplemental materials for on grade level teaching and learning 
the release of these products was not only important to our product strategy  but it also marked the beginning of the financial effects we expect to experience as we transition away from perpetual license products  for which revenue is recognized up front on delivery  to subscription license products  for which revenue is recognized over the subscription period 

table of contents the revenue decrease from to reflected a more rapid decline in perpetual license fee orders than we anticipated 
orders for perpetual license products declined from million in to million in  resulting in a decline in license fee revenues 
subscription orders  on the other hand  increased nearly to million 
subscription revenues  however  increased only slightly over as the new subscription products were not released until later in the fiscal year 
the restructuring of our sales organization and processes that began in has proven more challenging than we anticipated 
we continue to believe these changes were necessary to the long term success of our sales and marketing efforts  but they resulted in a high percentage of new account managers for most of fiscal year in addition  we have placed greater emphasis in our sales efforts on expanding beyond our traditional customer base to larger school districts and expanded applications of our products 
these changes in personnel  products and target customers negatively affected sales productivity during the year as total orders declined  from million in to million in  which also affected revenue 
in response to the lower order and revenue levels  we continued to manage our cost structure in total operating expenses declined million  or despite a million increase in restructuring  impairment and other charges 
operating expenses declined in all functional areas of the company  with sales and marketing expenses making up the majority of the decline  decreasing from million in to million in as a result of our cost management activities we have reduced our breakeven point to less than million of revenue 
we will continue in to execute the strategy we began late in  developing market leading new products that will be offered online  over the internet on a subscription basis 
the changes we made in our product development process late in have exceeded our expectations with new products being developed on time and under budget 
we will continue to develop our sales organization and expect sales productivity to improve in however  the changes in personnel  products and target customers will continue to challenge us in these efforts and this remains a risk for our performance in in addition to this risk  our business faces other risks that we discuss in more detail in item a of part i of this report 
our outlook for is consistent with the continuation of our transition from perpetual license products to subscription products and our expectation that sales productivity will improve 
sales order growth over is expected to be in the range of to 
revenue  however  is expected to decline by to as our order mix continues to transition from perpetual license products to subscription products 
we expect to report a net loss in  but expect it to improve to from the net loss in  excluding restructuring  impairment and other charges as expected cost reductions will more than offset the revenue decline 
for a more detailed discussion of our outlook  see the section captioned fiscal year outlook below 

table of contents results of operations our discussion and analysis of results of operations should be read in conjunction with the section above captioned general factors affecting our financial results 
revenues see note to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the reclassification of revenues and related cost of revenues previously reported as other in our statement of operations 
the following tables summarize certain key information to aid in the understanding of our discussion and analysis of revenues sales order information in thousands change from change from amount amount order value license fees subscriptions courseware assessment and other total subscriptions services percent of total order value license fees subscriptions courseware assessment and other total subscriptions services sales orders greater than  change from change from amount amount number value average value 
table of contents revenue by category in thousands change from change from amount amount license fees subscriptions services vs 
the decline in total orders from million in to million in reflects several factors the transition in the way we license our products 
in  we continued the transition of our products from those that are licensed on a perpetual basis  which have higher one time selling prices  to those that are licensed on a subscription basis  which have lower selling prices but are renewable at the end of each subscription period 
this transition was the primary factor contributing to the decline in perpetual license orders from to  the increase in subscription courseware orders over the same period  and the decline in the number of large orders those greater than  from in  to in the decline in orders for assessment and other subscription products reflects the maturity of these products 
the timing and availability of new products 
in we released two new products which represented key milestones in the subscription based product strategy we began executing in late straight curve mathematics was introduced in our third quarter with very positive reviews  however  the release did not align well with schools buying cycles 
our new online instructional management system  the plato learning environment  was introduced late in the third quarter 
though early acceptance was strong  some customers delayed their purchasing decisions to wait for additional features  scheduled to be released early in fiscal year  resulting in both an accelerated decline in perpetual license sales and lower than anticipated subscription sales 
the productivity of our sales organization 
in and early  we made significant changes to our sales organization and processes which resulted in a high percentage of new account managers for most of fiscal year in addition  we have placed greater emphasis in our sales efforts on expanding beyond our traditional customer base to larger school districts  which requires the development of new customer relationships 
we have also expanded the applications of our products which require new selling techniques for our sales force 
these changes in personnel  target customers and product emphasis negatively affected sales productivity during the year 
total revenues decreased to million in from million in  reflecting the decline in total orders discussed above  particularly the million decline in perpetual license fee orders  and the higher mix of 
table of contents subscription orders 
subscription revenues increased only slightly in compared to due to the timing of the release of new subscription orders later in our fiscal year as discussed above 
services revenues declined from on a decline in orders for professional services and for technical services  which are tied closely to perpetual license orders  partially offset by an increase in software support services which benefited from improved pricing discipline and an emphasis on obtaining renewals from existing perpetual license customers 
vs 
total revenues in declined to million  from million in  reflecting a significant decrease in license fee orders and revenues 
the number of orders greater than  declined  and the related value of these orders declined by 
these declines reflect the beginning of our emphasis on subscription based products as discussed above  and lower sales productivity caused by changes we made during in the sales organization  and the systems  processes and procedures they use 
many of these changes resulted in significant voluntary and involuntary turnover in our sales organization 
the decline in sales productivity also contributed to decreases in subscription revenues during the year 
service revenues increased in and benefited from the large deferred revenue balances at the beginning of the year 
service revenue growth also reflects an increase in supplemental educational services  which were provided for the first time in  and increases in software support fees from a growing customer base and delivery of training services 
gross profit see note to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the reclassification of revenues and related cost of revenues previously reported as other in our statement of operations 
the following tables summarize the percentage of total revenue  and the gross profit percentage for each revenue category to aid in the understanding of our discussion and analysis of gross profit percentage of total revenue revenue category license fees subscriptions services total gross profit percentage increase decrease revenue category to to license fees subscriptions services total total gross profit percentage reflects asset impairment changes of million and million in and  respectively that are not included in the revenue category gross profit percentages in this table 

table of contents vs 
the total gross profit percentage increased to in from in  primarily due to a reduction in asset impairment charges on capitalized product development costs and purchased technology assets from million in to million in the impairment charges were triggered by changes in product development strategies formalized in the fourth quarter of as part of our strategic product planning process 
these changes  as well as our financial performance  resulted in a reduction in anticipated future cash flows from products in development or purchased in previous acquisitions 
impairment charges related to products in development were million  and were primarily related to instructional management products which were expected to be phased out or discontinued when a replacement product was released in impairment charges related to purchased technology assets were million  and were primarily related to products which were expected to be replaced sooner than originally anticipated  which together with our financial performance  resulted in a decrease in the anticipated future cash flows from these products relative to the cash flows expected at the time these assets were purchased 
the impairment charge of million related to technology assets purchased in a previous acquisition 
as a result of our financial performance  our estimate of future cash flows attributable to these assets was reduced resulting in the impairment charge 
excluding the effects of the impairment charges from both periods  our gross profit percentage declined from to primarily due to lower revenues and changes in the mix of revenues 
higher margin license fee revenues decreased from to of total revenue  while lower margin service revenues increased from to of total revenues 
these changes in revenue mix were due to the factors discussed under revenues above 
the changes from to in the gross profit percentages of each revenue category were as follows the decline in the license fee gross profit percentage  from in to in  was the result of lower license fee revenues  as discussed above  on a base of primarily fixed costs 
the increase in the subscription gross profit percentage  from in to in  was due to a reduction in royalty fees due to a non recurring charge in and the renegotiation of an agreement which resulted in lower royalty fees in also contributing to the increase were higher subscription revenues on a base of primarily fixed costs which include amortization of capitalized software development and purchased technology  and depreciation and other infrastructure costs to support these hosted services 

table of contents the increase in the services gross profit percentage  from in to in  was due to improvements in the productivity and utilization of resources in our services organization and to an increase in the mix of software support services revenues which have low variable costs 
vs 
the total gross profit percentage decreased from in to in  primarily due to million in asset impairment charges in on capitalized product development costs and purchased technology assets as discussed above 
excluding the effect of the impairment charges  our gross profit percentage declined percentage points from  primarily due to changes in the mix of our revenues 
higher margin license fee revenues declined from to of total revenue  while lower margin service revenues increased from to of total revenues 
these changes in revenue mix are discussed under revenues above 
the decline in the license fee gross profit percentage  from in to in  was the result of lower license fee revenues  as discussed above  on a base of primarily fixed costs 
the decline in subscription margins in was due to additional non recurring royalty fees incurred in and to lower subscription revenues on a base of primarily fixed costs which include amortization of capitalized software development and purchased technology  and depreciation and other infrastructure costs to support these hosted services 
operating expenses the following table summarizes the percentage of total revenue and percentage change in total spending from the previous year for certain operating expense line items to aid in the understanding of our discussion and analysis of our operating expenses percent of total revenue increase decrease to to sales and marketing general and administrative product maintenance and development amortization of intangibles operating expenses excluding restructuring  impairment and other charges restructuring  impairment and other charges n a n a total operating expenses vs 
total operating expenses were million in  compared to million in these amounts include restructuring  impairment and other charges of million in and million in excluding these charges from both periods  operating expenses decreased million  or 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses were million in as compared to million in these decreases primarily reflect the effect of the sales organization changes we initiated in that resulted in voluntary and involuntary sales force attrition and reduced salaries  travel  professional services  facilities and other related costs 
also contributing to the decline was the realignment of our service resources from sales support to billable activities which shifted some costs from selling expense to cost of revenues  and decreased commissions resulting from the decrease in revenues 
general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in due primarily to a million reduction in bad debt expense 
the reduction in bad debt expense reflects sustained improvements in the quality of our accounts receivable attributable to tighter credit and other policies we implemented in other cost reductions in general and administrative expenses were largely offset by stock based compensation expense following the implementation in of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment 
these expenses totaled million  of which million were recorded in general and administrative expense 
product maintenance and development expenses for were million  comparable to the million reported for total product development spending  which represents spending on projects that are capitalized and those that are expensed  was million in  or of total revenues  compared to total spending in of million  or of total revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  we began the implementation of our new product strategy which accounts for the significant increase in total spending and the emphasis on new product development activities  which are generally capitalized 
amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of identified intangible assets  other than technology  acquired in acquisitions 
amortization of million in represented a decrease of from as certain assets acquired in earlier acquisitions became fully amortized during restructuring  impairment and other charges included in operating expenses in were million compared to million in the expense includes the following a non cash impairment charge of million related to customer and trademark intangible assets acquired in previous acquisitions 
this impairment charge was triggered by our actual financial performance and corresponding reductions in anticipated future revenues attributable to those assets 
these reductions related primarily to declines we experienced in the sale of certain perpetual license or maturing products that are sold to these customers  or that contain these trademarks 
cash restructuring charges of million related to uk facilities actions taken in these charges  which represent estimates of our remaining lease obligations on these facilities  include initial estimates of charges for a facility that was not formally vacated until and updated estimates for facilities vacated in cash restructuring charges of million for severance and other costs related to actual and anticipated us workforce reductions as we continue to align our cost structure with actual and expected revenue levels 

table of contents vs 
total operating expenses  including restructuring and other charges of million  were million 
excluding these charges  total operating expenses decreased million from  or  for the reasons outlined below 
sales and marketing expenses were million in as compared to million in  representing a decrease in both dollars and percentage of total revenue 
these decreases primarily reflect the sales organization changes and cost reductions we initiated in also contributing to the decline was the realignment of our service resources from sales support to billable activities which shifted some costs from selling expense to cost of revenues and decreased commissions resulting from the decrease in revenues 
general and administrative expenses were million in as compared to million in  representing a decrease in total spending of  but an increase as a percent of total revenues 
the decline in total spending was due primarily to a reduction in bad debt expense due to tighter credit and payment terms and the reduction in total revenues 
cost reduction activities initiated in also resulted in additional savings  but were offset by increased professional fees for sarbanes oxley compliance  senior management and board member changes  and process improvement initiatives in had these additional expenses not been incurred in  we would have expected general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenue to remain flat  or decline slightly  from product development expenses for were million  representing a decrease from the million reported for product development expense decreased due primarily to a shift in spending mix toward more capitalized projects compared to total product spending  which represents spending on projects that are capitalized and those that are expensed  was million in  which was comparable to total spending in of million 
amortization of intangibles represents the amortization of identified intangible assets  other than technology  acquired in acquisitions  the last of which was the lightspan acquisition in november amortization of million in was comparable to  given that the related assets are amortized on a straight line basis and did not change from to restructuring and other charges in totaled million related to restructuring activities in our uk subsidiary and our north american operations  primarily in our sales and development organizations 
the north american restructuring activities were designed to lower costs and align these organizations with our new business direction  while the uk activities were designed to lower costs in line with revenue expectations in this geographic market 
these costs consist of million in severance and related benefits paid to terminated employees  million related to executive officer terminations under employment agreements  million in costs related to facility closures  and million in other charges 
no restructuring costs were incurred in on october   the compensation committee of our board of directors approved an acceleration of the vesting of all stock options having an exercise price greater than the closing price of of our common stock on that date 
the acceleration covered approximately  outstanding options with a weighted average exercise price of 
approximately  of these options were held by executive management  who are restricted from selling such shares  subject to certain exceptions  prior to the date on which the exercise would have been permitted under the option s original vesting terms 
the objectives of the acceleration were to 
table of contents eliminate pre tax compensation expense of million that otherwise would have been recognized in future consolidated financial statements upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment  on november   and to improve employee retention 
interest income interest income increased from million in to million in an increase in interest rates earned on investments more than offset the decrease in our average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances over the prior year 
interest income increased from million in to million in this increase reflected an increase in our average cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances and the related interest rates earned on these investments 
income taxes as discussed earlier under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates  as a result of the lightspan acquisition  our net deferred tax assets as of the acquisition date  excluding the deferred tax liability relating to tax deductible goodwill  were fully reserved in the first quarter of  resulting in an increase to goodwill in purchase accounting 
accordingly  any reversal of this valuation allowance due to the subsequent realization of the deferred tax assets is recorded as a reduction to goodwill  as opposed to recording an income tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
in  we recorded income tax expense of million related to tax deductible goodwill which cannot be offset against existing deferred tax assets 
in  we recorded income tax expense of million  consisting of million related to tax deductible goodwill which cannot be offset against existing deferred tax assets  and million related to income taxes paid in states in which income taxes are not filed on a unitary  or consolidated legal entity basis 
because these states do not allow for the preparation of a consolidated tax return  certain legal entities under which we operate in the us may have taxable income in these states which can not be offset by losses from other legal entities 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents 
on october   cash and cash equivalents were million  a decrease of million from million at october  investments in internal and purchased software product development were million  an increase of million over the prior year resulting from two new significant products released in july our straight curve mathematics product and plato learning environment  our instructional management product which will be the foundation for all new products going forward 
offsetting these investments was million in cash from operations consisting of the net loss of million  offset by non cash depreciation  amortization and impairment charges of million  stock compensation expense of million and working capital changes of million 
non cash depreciation  amortization and impairment charges and the related effect of that impairment on the amortization 
the decrease in receivables of million reflects lower fourth quarter orders compared to the fourth quarter offset by improved collections 
cash provided by financing activities included million from the exercise of employee stock options 
equipment and leasehold improvement purchases in totaled million reflecting significant investments in sales organization productivity and management tools 

table of contents at october   cash and cash equivalents were million  an increase of million from october  approximately million of this increase represents the net conversion of long term and short term marketable securities to cash and cash equivalents during the year 
the balance of the increase reflects cash flows from operations in of million and million in proceeds primarily from the exercise of employee stock options  offset by investments of million in capitalized product development and million in equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash flows from operations in were down million from  reflecting the significant increase in our net loss in the investments in capitalized new product development were comparable to levels and primarily related to math and science courseware and an instructional management platform 
equipment and leasehold improvement purchases in were down significantly from  which included significant early investments in sales organization productivity tools 
working capital and liquidity 
at october   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents totaling of million and net accounts receivable of million 
our revolving loan agreement with wells fargo bank  na  which provided for a maximum million line of credit  expired on january  negotiations are in progress to replace this agreement 
working capital  defined as current assets minus current liabilities  was million and million at october  and  respectively 
the decrease in working capital was primarily due to million decrease in cash and cash equivalents as discussed above  a million decrease in net accounts receivable  offset by a million decrease in current deferred revenues 
the decrease in receivables reflects lower fourth quarter orders compared to fourth quarter the decrease in the current portion of deferred revenues was generally driven by an increase in the average length of subscription periods on orders  resulting in a greater amount being recorded as long term 
total deferred revenue  including amounts expected to be recognized in periods beyond october   increased million  from million at the end of to million at the end of our future liquidity needs will depend on  among other factors  the timing and extent of product development expenditures  order volume  the timing and collection of receivables  and expenditures in connection with possible acquisitions or stock repurchases 
we believe that existing cash and marketable securities balances and anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund our operations for the foreseeable future 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
our contractual obligations and commercial commitments consist primarily of future minimum payments due under operating leases and royalty and software license agreements 
in addition  any future borrowings under any revolving loan agreement as discussed above would require future use of cash 
on march   we signed a revised agreement with a third party provider of content used in certain of our software products 
under the revised agreement we were required to pay a total of million in non refundable license fees 
these payments are recorded in our balance sheet as product development costs and are being amortized to cost of subscription revenues 
the agreement also requires us to pay additional fees on a per license basis 
the agreement expires in october total amounts payable under the revised agreement are expected to be comparable to those under the former agreement
