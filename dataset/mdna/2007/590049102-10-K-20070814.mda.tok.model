item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and operations for information regarding net sales to each of our principal end user markets 
geographic information net sales by geographic region are defined by the region where the product is manufactured 
accordingly  net sales by geographic region are the same as net sales by segment 
see also note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
long lived assets by geographic location were as follows in thousands may  may  may  united states people s republic of china including hong kong sales and marketing we market our services and products through a field based direct sales force  field application engineers  manufacturers representative firms and customer service personnel 
we employ field application engineers in regions across north america  europe and asia that serve as the technical interface between us and our customers design engineering teams 
our field application engineers provide technical design assistance including information and modeling data to help assure that the customers final printed circuit board design meets the customers electrical performance requirements  cost goals and design guidelines for manufacturability 
we believe this collaboration of our engineers with our customers designers provides us with a significant competitive advantage 

table of contents we have a direct sales force presence in north america  europe and asia 
additionally  we have customer service resources in north america  asia and europe 
supplier relationships we have strong relationships with certain suppliers of raw materials and services to reduce the lead times associated with our acquisition of these materials and services and to reduce inventory carrying costs  enhance the quality and reliability of the supply of materials and reduce our transportation and other logistics costs 
some of our products use types of laminates that are only available from a single supplier that holds a patent on the material 
manufacturing and technology our printed circuit boards manufactured in the united states typically employ various combinations of high layer counts  advanced materials  precision cavities  embedded passives  narrow circuit widths and separations of copper traces and small diameter holes  called vias and microvias  which connect internal circuitry 
our asian facilities also employ advanced technology  however  merix asia typically manufactures printed circuit boards with lower layer counts and a narrower set of high technology features 
our average layer count  which is a widely used indication of manufacturing capability  was  and for printed circuit boards manufactured in our oregon  san jose and asia facilities  respectively  during fiscal the increasing complexity of electronic products has driven technological advancements in printed circuit boards and has placed increasingly difficult demands on the manufacturing process 
many of our printed circuit boards employ advanced high performance materials  such as high temperature composites  that offer electrical  thermal and long term reliability advantages over conventional materials 
we have significant expertise in developing advanced manufacturing techniques for processing these materials in our north american facilities 
we employ numerous advanced manufacturing techniques and systems  including automated imaging systems  automated optical inspection  computer controlled hot oil vacuum lamination  high speed computer controlled drilling and routing  automated registration optimizers  periodic reverse pulse copper plating  photo imageable solder mask processing  dual sided access electrical testing and automated surface coating 
traditionally  board designers have utilized increased board layer count to add features and functionality to their boards 
we generally receive circuit designs directly from our customers in the form of electronic data files  which we review using our front end engineering capabilities to ensure data accuracy and product manufacturability 
to aid in the efficiency and accuracy of this review  in fiscal  we implemented inplan  a suite of intelligent  fully integrated products for automating the pcb pre production engineering process for use in all our facilities 
this consistent set of tools standardizes across the globe manufacturing process planning  reduces cycle time  enhances quality and will be fully integrated with our erp system 
inplan results in a centralized global customer specification database to enable planning and manufacturing anywhere in the world 
using these reviewed and optimized electronic requirements  we generate images of the circuit patterns that are developed on individual circuit board layers using advanced photographic processes 
through a variety of plating and etching processes  we selectively add and remove conductive materials  forming horizontal layers of thin traces or circuits  which are separated by insulating material 
a finished multi layer printed circuit board consists of a number of layers of circuitry laminated together using intense heat and pressure under vacuum 
vertical connections between layers are achieved by plating vias  which are made by highly specialized drilling equipment capable of achieving extremely fine tolerances with high accuracy 
we specialize in high layer printed circuit boards with extremely fine geometries and tolerances 
because of the tolerances involved  we use clean rooms for certain manufacturing processes  in which tiny particles might otherwise create defects on the circuit patterns  and use automated optical inspection systems to ensure consistent quality 

table of contents research and development expenditures for research and development activities are included as a component of engineering expense on our consolidated statements of operations and are expensed as incurred 
competition we believe our major competitors have factories located in the united states and asia and have other international independent manufacturers that produce multi layer printed circuit boards  provide backplanes and other electronic assemblies and offer quick turn services 
those competitors include daeduck electronics co  ddi corp  elec and eltek  meadville holdings  ltd  lg electronics  multek corporation a division of flextronics international ltd  sanmina sci corporation  ttm technologies  inc  wus printed circuits company ltd 
and viasystems  inc we believe that our ability to compete successfully depends upon a number of factors  including the successful execution of our value proposition  which is dependent upon a number of factors including maintaining and growing our technological capability  particularly in asia  providing our customers with good product quality  our responsiveness to customers in delivery of service and the transitioning of their business throughout their product life cycle  our manufacturing capabilities and capacity across the globe  our cost structure  and our pricing 
backlog backlog comprises purchase orders received and  in some instances  forecast requirements released for production under customer contracts 
backlog totaled million and million at may  and may   respectively 
the backlog variation was primarily the result of the point in the business cycle we were in 
for example  in may  the general pcb markets were in a period of expansion and strong customer demand  whereas in may  it was believed to be at or near the low point of the business cycle 
a substantial portion of our backlog is typically scheduled for delivery within days and customers may cancel or postpone all scheduled orders  in most cases without penalty 
therefore  backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future financial results 
patents and other intellectual property although we seek to protect certain proprietary technology and other intangible assets  we believe our business depends on our effective execution of fabrication techniques and our ability to improve our manufacturing processes 
we generally enter into confidentiality and non disclosure agreements with our employees  consultants and customers  as needed  and generally limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information and processes 
we cannot be sure that the steps taken by us will prevent the misappropriation of our technology and processes 
furthermore  effective proprietary process protection may not be available or may be limited in the people s republic of china or other foreign countries 
environmental matters we are required to comply with foreign  federal  state  county and municipal regulations regarding protection of the environment and worker health and safety 
printed circuit board manufacturing requires the use of a variety of materials  including metals and chemicals 
as a result  we are subject to laws relating to the storage  use  labeling  disposal and human exposure to chemicals  solid waste and other hazardous materials  as well as air quality regulations  and we incur expenses relating to compliance with these laws and regulations 
many of our activities are also subject to permits issued by governmental agencies 
these permits must be renewed periodically and are subject to revocation in the event of violations of environmental laws 
certain waste materials and byproducts generated by our manufacturing 
table of contents processes are either processed by us or sent to third parties for recycling  reclamation  treatment or disposal 
water used in our manufacturing process must be properly treated prior to discharge 
we have evaluated our environmental health and safety practices to determine where deficiencies exist and are working to improve our compliance with these laws 
we incurred million and million of environmental remediation costs relating to the huizhou and huiyang facility  respectively  in the people s republic of china during fiscal and we anticipate incurring additional costs of approximately million in fiscal related to these projects 
when violations of environmental  health  and safety laws occur  we can be held liable for damages  penalties and costs of investigation and remedial actions  which could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
environmental laws could become more stringent over time  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations 
we are at risk of violation of environmental  health and safety laws in the future as a result of human error  equipment failure or other causes 
employees as of may   we had a total of approximately  workers  of which approximately  were regular employees and approximately were temporary workers 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union 
we have never experienced an employee related work stoppage at any of our facilities 
we believe our relationship with our employees is good  although  like most manufacturing companies  we have experienced employment related claims from time to time

risk factors risk factors affecting business and results of operations investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
if any of the following risks occur  the market price of our shares of common stock and other securities could decline and investors could lose all or part of their investment 
in addition  the following risk factors and uncertainties could cause our actual results to differ materially from those projected in our forward looking statements  whether made in this annual report on form k or the other documents we file with the sec  or in our annual or quarterly reports to shareholders  future press releases  or orally  whether in presentations  responses to questions or otherwise 
we are dependent upon the electronics industry  which is highly cyclical and suffers significant downturns in demand resulting in excess manufacturing capacity and increased price competition 
the electronics industry  on which a substantial portion of our business depends  is cyclical and subject to significant downturns characterized by diminished product demand  rapid declines in average selling prices and over capacity 
this industry has experienced periods characterized by relatively low demand and price depression and is likely to experience recessionary periods in the future 
economic conditions affecting the electronics industry  in general  or specific customers  in particular  have adversely affected our operating results in the past and may do so in the future 
the electronics industry is characterized by intense competition  rapid technological change  relatively short product life cycles and pricing and margin pressures 
these factors adversely affect our customers and we suffer similar effects 
our customers are primarily high technology equipment manufacturers in the communications  automotive  high end computing and storage  test and measurement  and aerospace and defense end markets of the electronics industry 
due to the uncertainty in the markets served by most of our customers  we cannot accurately predict our future financial results or accurately anticipate future orders 
at any time  our customers can discontinue or modify products containing components manufactured by us  adjust the timing of orders and shipments or affect our mix of consolidated net sales generated from quick turn services and premium revenues versus standard lead time production  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
lower sales may cause gross profits and operating results to decrease because many of our operating costs are fixed 
a significant portion of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in nature  and planned expenditures are based in part on anticipated orders 
if we do not receive orders as anticipated or if revenue is reduced by reductions in the proportion of our quick turn services and premium business  our operating results will be adversely affected 
revenue shortfalls have historically resulted in an underutilization of our installed capacity and  together with adverse pricing  have decreased our gross profits 
future decreases in demand or pricing will likely decrease our gross profits and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations 
competition in the printed circuit board market is intense and we could lose sales if we are unable to compete effectively 
the market for printed circuit boards is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
we expect competition to persist  which could result in continued reductions in pricing and gross profits and loss of market share 
we believe our major competitors are united states  asian and other international independent manufacturers of multi layer printed circuit boards  backplanes and other electronic assemblies  and companies that offer quick turn services 
those competitors include daeduck electronics co  ddi corp  elec and eltek  meadville holdings  ltd  lg electronics  multek corporation a division of flextronics international ltd  sanmina sci corporation  ttm technologies  inc  wus printed circuits company ltd 
and viasystems  inc 
table of contents some of our competitors and potential competitors may have a number of advantages over us  including significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and manufacturing resources  preferred vendor status with some of our existing and potential customers  more capital  and larger customer bases 
in addition  these competitors may have the ability to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies  be more successful in entering or adapting to existing or new end markets  adapt more quickly to changes in customer requirements and devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we can 
consolidation in the printed circuit board industry  which we expect to continue  could result in an increasing number of larger printed circuit board companies with greater market power and resources 
such consolidation could in turn increase price competition and result in other competitive pressures for us 
we must continually develop improved manufacturing processes to meet our customers needs for complex  high technology products  and our basic interconnect technology is generally not subject to significant proprietary protection 
we may not be able to maintain or expand our sales if competition increases and we are unable to respond effectively 
during recessionary periods in the electronics industry  our competitive advantages in providing an integrated manufacturing solution and responsive customer service may be less important to our customers than when they are in more favorable economic climates 
if competitive production capabilities increase in asia  where production costs are lower  we may lose market share in both north america and asia and our gross profits may be materially adversely affected by increased pricing pressure 
printed circuit board manufacturers in asia and other geographies often have significantly lower production costs than our north american operations and may even have cost advantages over merix asia 
production capability improvements by foreign and domestic competitors may play an increasing role in the printed circuit board markets in which we compete  which may adversely affect our revenues and profitability 
while printed circuit board manufacturers in these locations have historically competed primarily in markets for less technologically advanced products  they are expanding their manufacturing capabilities to produce higher layer count  higher technology printed circuit boards 
success in asia may adversely affect our us operations 
to the extent asian printed circuit board manufacturers  including merix asia  are able to compete effectively with products historically manufactured in the united states  our facilities in the united states may not be able to compete as effectively and parts of our north american operations may not remain viable 
the cyclical nature of automotive production and sales could adversely affect merix business 
a significant portion of merix asia s products are sold to customers in the automotive industry 
as a result  merix asia s results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by market conditions in the automotive industry 
automotive production and sales are cyclical and depend on general economic conditions and other factors  including consumer spending and preferences 
in addition  automotive production and sales can be affected by labor relations issues  regulatory requirements  trade agreements and other factors 
any significant economic decline that results in a reduction in automotive production and sales by merix asia s customers could have a material adverse effect on merix business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on suppliers for the timely delivery of materials used in manufacturing our printed circuit boards  and an increase in industry demand  a shortage of supply or an increase in the price of raw materials may increase the cost of the raw materials we use and may limit our ability to manufacture certain products and adversely impact our gross profits 
to manufacture our printed circuit boards  we use materials such as laminated layers of fiberglass  copper foil and chemical solutions which we order from our suppliers 
suppliers of laminates and other raw materials that we use may from time to time extend lead times  limit supplies or increase prices due to capacity constraints or other factors  which could adversely affect our gross profits and our ability to 
table of contents deliver our products on a timely basis 
we have recently experienced  and expect that we will continue to experience  significant increases in the cost of laminate materials  copper products and oil based or oil derivative raw materials 
these cost increases have had an adverse impact on our gross profits and the impact has been particularly significant on our asian operations which have fixed price arrangements with a number of large automotive customers 
some of our products use types of laminates that are only available from a single supplier that holds a patent on the material 
although other manufacturers of advanced printed circuit boards also must use the single supplier and our oem customers generally determine the type of laminates used  a failure to obtain the material from the single supplier for any reason may cause a disruption  and possible cancellation  of orders for printed circuit boards using that type of laminate  which in turn would cause a decrease in our consolidated net sales 
our recent acquisitions may be costly and difficult to integrate  may divert and dilute management resources and may dilute shareholder value 
recently  we announced our intention to accelerate the expansion of both production capability and capacity at our china based factories 
this expansion  coupled with the closure of our hong kong based facility  will further increase the risk of integration of merix asia 
there is no guarantee that the expansion and closure will be completed as planned 
as part of our business strategy  we have made and may continue to make acquisitions of  or investments in  companies  products or technologies that complement our current products  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or production capacity or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in connection with our san jose and asian acquisitions  we have experienced  and in any future acquisitions or investments  we could experience problems integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  failure to achieve potential sales  materials costs and other synergies  unanticipated expenses and working capital requirements  diversion of management s attention and loose key employees  further charges and asset impairments related to the acquisitions  and problems completing anticipated technology transfers to our asian operations 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions or investments  we could issue stock that would dilute our current shareholders percentage ownership  incur debt and assume liabilities that could impair our liquidity  incur amortization expenses related to intangible assets  uncover previous unknown liabilities  or incur large and immediate write offs that would reduce net income 
any of these factors could prevent us from realizing anticipated benefits of an acquisition or investment  including operational synergies  economies of scale and increased profit margins and revenue 
acquisitions are inherently risky  and any acquisition may not be successful 
failure to manage and successfully integrate acquisitions could harm our business and operating results in a material way 
even when an acquired company has already developed and marketed products  product enhancements may not be made in a timely fashion 
in addition  unforeseen issues might arise with respect to such products after the acquisition 
if we do not effectively manage the expansion of our operations  our business may be harmed  and the increased costs associated with the expansion may not be offset by increased consolidated net sales 
we recently announced our intentions to significantly expand the huiyang  china based facility and any other future capacity expansion with respect to our facilities will expose us to significant start up risks including delays in receiving and installing required manufacturing equipment  inability to retain management personnel and skilled employees  or labor shortages in general  difficulties scaling up production at our expanded facilities  
table of contents challenges in coordinating management of operations and order fulfillment between our us and asian facilities  a need to improve and expand our management information systems and financial controls to accommodate our expanded operations  additional unanticipated costs  and shortfalls in production volumes as a result of unanticipated start up or expansion delays that could prevent us from meeting our customers delivery schedules or production needs 
the success of our expansion efforts will depend upon our ability to expand  train  retain and manage our employee base in both asia and north america 
in connection with our expansion efforts in asia  we expect to require additional employees throughout the company 
if we are unable to attract and train and retain new workers  or manage our employee base effectively  our ability to fully utilize our asian assets will likely be impaired 
if we are unable to effectively expand  train and manage our employee base  our business and results of operations could be adversely affected 
in addition  if our consolidated net sales do not increase sufficiently to offset the additional fixed operating expenses associated with our asian operations  our consolidated results of operations may be adversely affected 
if demand for our products does not meet anticipated levels  the value of the expanded operations could be significantly impaired  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to respond to rapid technological change and process development  we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continual implementation of new production processes 
the success of our business depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and enhance our technological capabilities  to manufacture products that meet changing customer needs  and to successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes on a cost effective and timely basis 
in addition  the printed circuit board industry could encounter competition from new or revised manufacturing and production technologies that render existing manufacturing and production technology less competitive or obsolete 
we may not be able to respond effectively to the technological requirements of the changing market 
if we need new technologies and equipment to remain competitive  the development  acquisition and implementation of those technologies and equipment may require us to make significant capital investments 
we may not be able to raise the necessary additional funds at all or as rapidly as necessary to respond to technological changes as quickly as our competitors 
we are subject to risks associated with currency fluctuations  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
a significant portion of our costs are denominated in foreign currencies  including the hong kong dollar and the chinese renminbi rmb 
substantially all of our consolidated net sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  changes in the exchange rates of these foreign currencies to the us dollar will affect our cost of sales and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
the exchange rate of the chinese renminbi to the us dollar is closely monitored by the chinese government 
recent increases in the value of the renminbi relative to the us dollar have caused the costs of our chinese operations to increase relative to related dollar denominated sales 
the impact of future exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations cannot be accurately predicted 
we may enter into exchange rate hedging programs from time to time in an effort to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
however  hedging transactions may not be effective and may result in foreign exchange hedging losses 
we have a bank credit covenant that limits the incremental investment in merix asia merix has a bank credit agreement covenant that limits the incremental investment into merix asia to million 
as of august   we had advanced merix asia approximately million against the incremental investment limit 
if our asian operations at any time require an amount of cash greater than our available capital resources  or than is permitted to be advanced under applicable credit agreements  
table of contents or otherwise  there is risk that we will not be able to fund our asian operations and the growth plans in asia 
we have minority investors in our china manufacturing facilities 
currently  we have two printed circuit board manufacturing plants in the people s republic of china the prc that are each partially owned by a separate chinese company 
while we are the majority interest holder in both of these companies  there are minority interest holders in each of them 
the aggregate minority interest in these companies ranges from to 
these minority holders are local investors with close ties to local economic development and other government agencies 
the investors lease to the chinese operating companies the land on which the plants are located 
in connection with the negotiation of their investments  the local investors secured certain rights to be consulted and consent to certain operating and investment matters concerning the plants and to board representation 
failure to maintain good relations with these investors could materially adversely affect our ability to manage the operations of one or more of the plants and our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the asian acquisition 
we do not currently have options to renew our leased manufacturing facility in the prc 
our facility is leased from a chinese company under an operating lease that does not contain a lease renewal option 
while that the landlord also has a minority interest in our subsidiary that operates the facility  this minority interest holder may not renew our lease 
failure to maintain good relations with this investor could materially adversely affect our ability to negotiate the renewal of our operating lease or to continue to operate the plant 
further  failure to successfully renew such lease could materially adversely affect our ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the asian acquisition 
we may not be able to remediate the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting 
a material weakness is a control deficiency  or combination of control deficiencies  that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected 
in connection with management s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting  we identified the following material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting as of may  merix asia was acquired in september upon acquisition  merix asia had weak internal controls over financial reporting and needed to develop processes to strengthen its accounting systems and control environment management 
we have devoted significant time and resources to improving the internal controls over financial reporting since the acquisition 
however  as of may   merix management did not maintain sufficient controls to adequately monitor the accounting and financial reporting of our merix asia operations 
this material weakness resulted in adjustments to our annual consolidated financial statements that were identified by management and the external auditors 
additionally  this control deficiency could result in a material misstatement to the interim or annual consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected in a timely manner 
accordingly  management has determined that this control deficiency constitutes a material weakness 
remediation steps to address material weakness because of the material weakness identified in our evaluation of internal control over financial reporting  we performed and plan to perform additional steps to enhance internal control over financial reporting 
our procedures included  but were not limited to  the following we completed a comprehensive review of inventories in asia  including a detailed tie out to physical inventory counts 
we also reviewed inventory data from interim quarters in fiscal to ensure no material misstatement occurred 
we plan to perform physical inventory counts at each quarter end during fiscal until our global enterprise resource planning system is in place for our asia operations 
previously  this was an annual control  which highlighted an inventory issue at year end 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we have devoted time and resources to implement and improve the cost accounting systems for merix asia and to strengthen our analytical procedures focused on trends and variance analysis to budgets and forecasts 
today  these 
table of contents processes are not formally documented 
in fiscal  we plan to implement detailed periodic reviews of the results of merix asia with documented results and follow up actions to improve the control currently in place 
additionally  these reviews will provide for more formal communication processes related to financial statement adjustments and changes in the internal control environment 
we have invested significant amounts of time and expense on training for financial personnel in asia and in the us 
we have also begun more frequent oversight trips to asia 
we continue to work toward the world wide implementation of our global enterprise resource planning erp system and expect merix asia to adopt this system prior to the end of fiscal the new erp system will allow for greater consistency of accounting processes and internal controls between our us and asia operations and it will give us greater visibility into the accounting records and accounting practices in merix asia 
we will continue to reaffirm a tone that compliance with our controls over financial reporting is extremely important and we will continue to impress that throughout our company 
we have hired a third party to perform a focused procedural audit of areas we believe represent higher risk in merix asia 
we plan to continue to have third party internal audits performed 
we are realigning our organization structure across the company along function lines 
we believe this will result in more accountability across the organization and allow for sharing of best practices across all functions and will improve the overall control environment 
although we are implementing remedial controls and procedures to address this matter  if we fail to remedy the material weakness in a timely manner  it could cause us to improperly record our financial position and results of operations and could result in us failing to meet our financial reporting responsibilities in future reporting periods 
automotive customers have higher quality requirements and long qualification times 
for safety reasons  our automotive customers have strict quality standards that generally exceed the quality requirements of our other customers 
because a significant portion of merix asia s products are sold to customers in the automotive industry  if our manufacturing facilities in asia do not meet these quality standards  our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected 
these automotive customers may require long periods of time to evaluate whether our manufacturing processes and facilities meet their quality standards 
if we were to lose automotive customers due to quality control issues  we might not be able to regain those customers  or gain new automotive customers  for long periods of time  which could significantly decrease our consolidated net sales and profitability 
a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our consolidated net sales and our consolidated net sales could decline significantly if we lose a major customer or if a major customer orders fewer of our products or cancels or delays orders 
historically  we have derived a significant portion of our consolidated net sales from a limited number of customers 
our five largest oem customers  which vary from period to period  comprised and of our consolidated net sales during fiscal and  respectively 
net sales to two customers individually represented and of consolidated net sales during fiscal net sales to one customer represented of consolidated net sales during fiscal we expect to continue to depend upon a small number of customers for a significant portion of our consolidated net sales for the foreseeable future 
the loss of  or decline in  orders from one or more major customers could reduce our consolidated net sales and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
some of our customers are relatively small companies  and our future business with them may be significantly affected by their ability to continue to obtain financing 
if they are unable to obtain adequate financing  they will not be able to purchase products  which  in the aggregate  would adversely affect our consolidated net sales 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and also as a result of a concentration of our customer base 
most of our sales are on an open credit basis  with standard industry payment terms 
we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting open credit arrangements  seek to limit open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay  and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts 
during periods of economic downturn in the global economy and the 
table of contents electronics and automotive industries  our exposure to credit risks from our customers increases 
although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk  those programs may not be effective in reducing our credit risks 
in total  five entities represented approximately of the consolidated net trade accounts receivable balance at may   individually ranging from approximately to approximately 
our oem customers direct our sales to a relatively limited number of electronic manufacturing service providers 
our contractual relationship is typically with the electronic manufacturing service providers  who are obligated to pay us for our products 
because we expect our oem customers to continue to direct our sales to electronic manufacturing service providers  we expect to continue to be subject to the credit risk of a limited number of customers 
this concentration of customers exposes us to increased credit risks 
if one or more of our significant customers were to become insolvent or were otherwise unable to pay us  our financial condition results of operations would be adversely affected 
because we do not generally have long term contracts with our customers  we are subject to uncertainties and variability in demand by our customers  which could decrease consolidated net sales and negatively affect our operating results 
we generally do not have long term purchase commitments from our customers  and  consequently  our consolidated net sales are subject to short term variability in demand by our customers 
customers generally have no obligation to order from us and may cancel  reduce or delay orders for a variety of reasons 
the level and timing of orders placed by our customers vary due to fluctuation in demand for our customers products  changes in customers manufacturing strategies  such as a decision by a customer to either diversify or consolidate the number of printed circuit board manufacturers used  customers inventory management  and changes in new product introductions 
we have experienced terminations  reductions and delays in our customers orders 
future terminations  reductions or delays in our customers orders could lower our production asset utilization  which would lower our gross profits  decrease our consolidated net sales and negatively affect our business and results of operations 
our operations in the people s republic of china subject us to risks and uncertainties relating to the laws and regulations of the people s republic of china 
under its current leadership  the chinese government has been pursuing economic reform policies  including the encouragement of foreign trade and investment and greater economic decentralization 
however  the government of the prc may not continue to pursue such policies 
despite progress in developing its legal system  the prc does not have a comprehensive and highly developed system of laws  particularly with respect to foreign investment activities and foreign trade 
enforcement of existing and future laws and contracts is uncertain  and implementation and interpretation thereof may be inconsistent 
as the chinese legal system develops  the promulgation of new laws  changes to existing laws and the preemption of local regulations by national laws may adversely affect foreign investors 
for example  the prc recently passed a unified enterprise income tax law  which changes the income tax on foreign owned facilities 
in addition  some government policies and rules are not timely published or communicated in the local districts  if they are published at all 
as a result  we may operate our business in violation of new rules and policies without having any knowledge of their existence 
these uncertainties could limit the legal protections available to us 
any litigation in the prc may be protracted and result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could adversely affect our business 
our operations are regulated under a number of federal  state and municipal environmental and safety laws and regulations including laws in hong kong and the prc that govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous and other materials into the air and water  as well as the handling  storage  labeling  and disposal of such materials 
when violations of environmental laws occur  we can be held liable for damages  penalties and costs of investigation and remedial actions 
violations of environmental 
table of contents laws and regulations may occur as a result of our failure to have necessary permits  human error  equipment failure or other causes 
moreover  in connection with our acquisitions in san jose  california and in asia  we may be liable for any violations of environmental and safety laws at those facilities by prior owners 
if we violate environmental laws  we may be held liable for damages and the costs of investigations and remedial actions and may be subject to fines and penalties  and revocation of permits necessary to conduct our business 
any permit revocations could require us to cease or limit production at one or more of our facilities  and harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
even if we ultimately prevail  environmental lawsuits against us would be time consuming and costly to defend 
our failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations could limit our ability to expand facilities or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses to comply with these laws and regulations 
in the future  environmental laws may become more stringent  imposing greater compliance costs and increasing risks and penalties associated with violations 
we operate in environmentally sensitive locations and we are subject to potentially conflicting and changing regulatory agendas of political  business and environmental groups 
changes or restrictions on discharge limits  emissions levels  permitting requirements and material storage  handling or disposal might require a high level of unplanned capital investment  operating expenses or  depending on the severity of the impact of the foregoing factors  costly plant relocation 
it is possible that environmental compliance costs and penalties from new or existing regulations may harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we are potentially liable for contamination at our current and former facilities as well as at sites where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous wastes  if such sites become contaminated 
these liabilities could include investigation and remediation activities 
it is possible that remediation of these sites could adversely affect our business and operating results in the future 
our chinese and hong kong manufacturing operations subject us to a number of risks we have not faced in the past 
a substantial portion of our current manufacturing operations is located in the prc and hong kong 
the geographical distances between these facilities and our us headquarters create a number of logistical and communications challenges 
we are also subject to a highly competitive market for labor in the prc and hong kong  which may require us to increase employee wages and benefits to attract and retain employees and spend significant resources to train new employees due to high employee turnover  either of which could cause our labor costs to exceed our expectations 
in addition  because of the location of these facilities  we could be affected by economic and political instability in the prc or hong kong  including lack of developed infrastructure  currency fluctuations  overlapping taxes and multiple taxation issues  employment and severance taxes  the burdens of cost  compliance and interpretation of a variety of foreign laws  difficulty in attracting and training workers in foreign markets and problems caused by labor unrest  and less protection of our proprietary processes and know how 
moreover  inadequate development or maintenance of infrastructure in the prc  including inadequate power and water supplies  transportation or raw materials availability  communications infrastructure or the deterioration in the general political  economic or social environment  could make it difficult and more expensive  and possibly prohibitive  to continue to operate our manufacturing facilities in the prc 
because we have significant foreign sales and presence  we are subject to political  economic and other risks we do not face in the domestic market 
with the acquisition of our asian operations  we expect sales in  and product shipments to  non us markets to represent an increasingly significant portion of our total sales in future periods 
our exposure to the business risks presented by foreign economies includes logistical  communications and other operational difficulties in managing a global enterprise  
table of contents potentially adverse tax consequences  restrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country  longer sales and collection cycles  potential adverse changes in laws and regulatory practices  including export license requirements  trade barriers  tariffs and tax laws  protectionist and trade laws and business practices that favor local companies  restrictive governmental actions  burdens and costs of compliance with a variety of foreign laws  political and economic instability  including terrorist activities  natural disaster or outbreaks of infectious diseases affecting the regions in which we operate or sell products  and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
products we manufacture may contain manufacturing defects  which could result in reduced demand for our products and liability claims against us 
we manufacture highly complex products to our customers specifications 
these products may contain manufacturing errors or failures despite our quality control and quality assurance efforts 
defects in the products we manufacture  whether caused by a design  manufacturing or materials failure or error  may result in delayed shipments  increased warranty costs  customer dissatisfaction  or a reduction in or cancellation of purchase orders 
if these defects occur either in large quantities or too frequently  our business reputation may be impaired 
since our products are used in products that are integral to our customers businesses  errors  defects or other performance problems could result in financial or other damages to our customers beyond the cost of the printed circuit board  for which we may be liable in some cases 
although we generally attempt to sell our products on terms designed to limit our exposure to warranty  product liability and related claims  in certain cases  the terms of our agreements allocate to merix substantial exposure for product defects 
in addition  even if we can contractually limit our exposure  existing or future laws or unfavorable judicial decisions could negate these limitations of liability provisions 
product liability litigation against us  even if it were unsuccessful  would be time consuming and costly to defend 
although we maintain a warranty reserve  this reserve may not be sufficient to cover our warranty or other expenses that could arise as a result of defects in our products 
merix may incur material losses and costs as a result of product liability and warranty claims that may be brought against us 
we face an inherent business risk of exposure to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our products  particularly those supplied by merix asia to the automotive industry  fail to perform as expected or such failure results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury and or property damage 
in addition  if any of our products are or are alleged to be defective  we may be required to participate in a recall of such products 
as suppliers become more integral to the vehicle design process and assume more of the vehicle assembly functions  vehicle manufacturers are increasingly looking to their suppliers for contributions when faced with product liability claims or recalls 
in addition  vehicle manufacturers  who have traditionally borne the cost associated with warranty programs offered on their vehicles  are increasingly requiring suppliers to guarantee or warrant their products and may seek to hold us responsible for some or all of the costs related to the repair and replacement of parts supplied by us to the vehicle manufacturer 
a successful warranty or product liability claim against us in excess of our available insurance coverage or established warranty and legal reserves or a requirement that we participate in a product recall may have a material adverse effect on our business 
as we commence our work to implement a new enterprise resource planning erp system  unexpected problems and delays could occur and could cause disruption to the management of our business and significantly increase costs 
we are currently using multiple erp and other information systems 
we began the initial design and implementation for a single world wide erp system during fiscal we expect the new erp system will become integral to our ability to accurately and efficiently maintain our books and records  record our transactions  provide critical information to our management and prepare our financial statements 
our 
table of contents work to plan  develop and implement this new erp system will continue into fiscal as an active project 
these systems are new to us and we have not had extensive experience with them 
the new erp system could eventually become more costly  difficult and time consuming to purchase and implement than we currently anticipate 
implementation of the new erp system may require us to change certain internal business practices 
we may encounter unexpected difficulties  delays  costs or other challenges  any of which may disrupt our business 
corrections and improvements may be required as we continue the implementation of our new system  procedures and controls  and could cause us to incur additional costs and require additional management attention  placing burdens on our internal resources 
any delay in the implementation of  or disruption in the transition to our new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain  achieve accuracy in the conversion of electronic data and records and to report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
failure to properly or adequately address these issues could result in the diversion of management s attention and resources and impact our ability to manage our business and our results of operations 
if we lose key management  operations  engineering and sales and marketing personnel  we could experience reduced sales  delayed product development and diversion of management resources 
our success depends largely on the continued contributions of our key management  administration  operations  engineering and sales and marketing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we generally do not have employment or non compete agreements with our key personnel 
if one or more members of our senior management or key professionals were to resign  the loss of personnel could result in loss of sales  delays in new product development and diversion of management resources  which would have a negative effect on our business 
we do not maintain key man insurance policies on any of our personnel 
successful execution of our day to day business operations  including our manufacturing process  depends on the collective experience of our employees and we have experienced periods of high employee turnover 
if high employee turnover persists  our business may suffer and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we rely on the collective experience of our employees  particularly in the manufacturing process  to ensure we continuously evaluate and adopt new technologies and remain competitive 
although we are not generally dependent on any one employee or a small number of employees involved in our manufacturing process  we have experienced periods of high employee turnover generally and continue to experience significantly high employee turnover at our asian facilities 
if we are not able to replace these people with new employees with comparable capabilities  our operations could suffer as we may be unable to keep up with innovations in the industry or the demands of our customers 
as a result  we may not be able to continue to compete effectively 
pending or future litigation could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 
we are currently subject to legal proceedings and claims  including a securities class action lawsuit 
in the complaint  the plaintiffs seek unspecified damages 
this lawsuit and others are described in part i  item legal proceedings below 
more lawsuits could be filed against us 
where we can make a reasonable estimate of any probable liability relating to pending litigation  we record a liability 
although we have created a reserve for some of the potential legal fees associated with litigation currently pending against us  we have not created any reserve for potential liability for settlements or judgments because the potential liability is neither probable nor estimable 
even when we record a liability  the amount of our estimates of costs or liabilities could be wrong 
in addition to the direct costs of litigation  pending or future litigation could divert management s attention and resources from the operation of our business 
accordingly  our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents we may be required to record asset impairment charges in the future 
as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we recorded impairment charges against certain assets in fiscal as our strategy evolves and due to the cyclicality of our business  rapid technological change and the migration of business to asia  we might conclude in the future that some of our manufacturing facilities are surplus to our needs or will not generate sufficient future cash flows to cover the net book value and  thus  we may be required to record an impairment charge 
such an impairment charge would adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we may have exposure to income tax rate fluctuations as well as to additional tax liabilities  which would impact our financial position 
as a corporation with operations both in the united states and abroad  we are subject to taxes in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate is subject to fluctuation as the income tax rates for each year are a function of the following factors  among others the effects of a mix of profits or losses earned by us and our subsidiaries in numerous tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  our ability to utilize net operating losses  changes in contingencies related to taxes  interest or penalties resulting from tax audits  and changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such laws 
changes in the mix of these items and other items may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate between periods  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position 
we are also subject to non income taxes  such as payroll  sales  use  value added  net worth  property and goods and services taxes  in both the united states and various foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  we cannot assure you that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals 
risks related to our corporate structure and stock our stock price has fluctuated significantly  and we expect the trading price of our common stock to remain highly volatile 
the closing trading price of our common stock has fluctuated from a low of less than per share to a high of more than per share over the past years 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors including actual and anticipated variations in our operating results  general economic and market conditions  including changes in demand in the printed circuit board industry and the end markets which we serve  interest rates  geopolitical conditions throughout the world  perceptions of the strengths and weaknesses of the printed circuit board industry and the end markets which it serves  our ability to pay principal and interest on our debt when due  developments in our relationships with our lenders  customers  and or suppliers  announcements of alliances  mergers or other relationships by or between our competitors and or our suppliers and customers  announcements of plant closings  layoffs  restructurings or bankruptcies by our competitors  and developments related to regulations  including environmental and wastewater regulations 
we expect volatility to continue in the future 
in recent years  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the printed circuit board industry and that may 
table of contents be unrelated to the operating performance of the companies within these industries 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and limit our ability to raise capital or finance transactions using equity instruments 
a large number of our outstanding shares and shares to be issued upon exercise of our outstanding options may be sold into the market in the future  which could cause the market price of our common stock to drop significantly  even if our business is doing well 
we may  in the future  sell additional shares of our common stock  or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock  to raise capital 
we may also issue additional shares of our common stock  or securities convertible into or exercisable for shares of our common stock  to finance future acquisitions 
further  a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance pursuant to stock options 
as of may   we had  outstanding options  each to purchase one share of our common stock  issued to employees  officers and directors under our equity incentive plans 
the options have exercise prices ranging from per share to per share 
these outstanding options could have a significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock  especially if a significant volume of the options was exercised and the stock issued was immediately sold into the public market 
further  the exercise of these options could have a dilutive impact on other shareholders by decreasing their ownership percentage of our outstanding common stock 
if we attempt to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the terms upon which we will be able to obtain additional equity capital  if at all  may be negatively affected since the holders of outstanding options can be expected to exercise them  to the extent they are able  at a time when we would  in all likelihood  be able to obtain any needed capital on terms more favorable than those provided in such options 
some provisions contained in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  as well as provisions of oregon law  could inhibit a takeover attempt 
some of the provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws  such as the authorization of blank check preferred stock  and oregon s anti takeover laws could delay or prevent a merger or acquisition between us and a third party  or make a merger or acquisition with us less desirable to a potential acquirer  even in circumstances in which our shareholders may consider the merger or acquisition favorable 
any of these provisions that have the effect of delaying or deterring a merger or acquisition between us and a third party could limit the opportunity for our shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock  and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading global manufacturing service provider for technologically advanced printed circuit boards for original equipment manufacturer oem customers  and their electronic manufacturing service ems providers 
our principal products are complex multi layer rigid printed circuit boards  which are the platforms used to interconnect microprocessors  integrated circuits and other components that are essential to the operation of electronic products and systems 
the market segments we serve are primarily in commercial equipment in the communications and networking  computing and peripherals  industrial and medical  defense and aerospace and automotive markets 
our markets are generally characterized by rapid technological change  high levels of complexity and short product life cycles  as new and technologically superior electronic equipment is continually being developed 
we have focused our efforts on shortened lead time delivery also known as quick turn services  manufacturing more technologically advanced designs and volume production 
to enable our strategies  we made two significant recent acquisitions in december  we acquired merix san jose formerly data circuits systems  inc  a leader in quick turn services  to expand in this higher margin segment of the pcb market and to provide sales synergies with merix oregon operations 
in september  we acquired merix asia formerly eastern pacific circuits holdings limited to gain immediate access to the growing and lower cost asian markets 
the principal assets acquired in the merix asia acquisition were three multi layer pcb factories  one of which was located in hong kong and two in southeastern china 
the strategy in acquiring merix asia was to provide customers with a global service provider that offers quick turn services  an ability to ramp to production volumes in north america and a seamless transition to the lower cost asian region as products mature 
to successfully execute on the acquisition strategy  we are increasing the technological capabilities of these facilities  over time  while improving the value of the product mix being manufactured by these facilities and are restructuring our asian operations to further this strategy 
most electronics manufacturers utilize multiple printed circuit board pcb sources depending upon the stage of a product s life cycle eg design  new product introduction npi  ramping to production  product maturity in search of lower cost solutions  etc 
each time production is moved  it results in increased risks eg different processes  quality variations and varying material sets and a lengthy transition period 
today  merix is able to address these issues by providing quick turn and volume production in the united states and lower cost solutions in asia 
our acquisitions significantly expanded our sales representative network and diversified our customer base 
these acquisitions added over new customers and expanded our services into new vertical markets 

table of contents if our acquisitions of merix asia and merix san jose had occurred on may   our pro forma consolidated net sales and net loss for fiscal and would have been as follows unaudited and in thousands  except per share data fiscal year ended  may  may  net sales net loss basic net loss per share diluted net loss per share please read note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and  as a result of the assumptions  estimates and uncertainties  the pro forma financial information does not purport to describe the actual financial results that would have been achieved had the acquisitions in fact occurred at the beginning of the periods for which pro forma financial information is given 
operating segments our business has three operating segments merix oregon  merix san jose and merix asia 
operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise for which separate financial information is available and regularly reviewed by senior management 
each operating segment operates predominately in the same industry with production facilities that produce similar customized products for our global customers 
the chief decision maker for all of our operating segments is our chief executive officer

during fiscal  none of merix san jose s customers represented or more of merix san jose s net sales 
approximately  and  respectively  of our oem sales in fiscal  and were made to ems providers 
although our contractual relationship is with the ems provider  most of our shipments to ems providers are directed by oems that negotiate product pricing and volumes directly with us 
in addition  we are on the approved vendor list of several ems providers and are awarded incremental discretionary orders directly from some of them 
we expect these discretionary orders to increase in the future as we strengthen our direct relationships with these ems providers 

table of contents backlog backlog comprises purchase orders received and  in some instances  forecast requirements released for production under customer contracts 
backlog totaled million and million at may  and may   respectively 
the backlog variation was primarily the result of the point in the business cycle we were in 
for example  in may  the general pcb markets were in a period of expansion and strong customer demand  whereas in may  it was believed to be at or near the low point of the business cycle 
a substantial portion of our backlog is typically scheduled for delivery within days and customers may cancel or postpone all scheduled orders  in most cases without penalty 
therefore  backlog may not be a meaningful indicator of future financial results 
results of operations the following table sets forth our statement of operations data in thousands of dollars 
fiscal year ended may  may  may  net sales cost of sales gross profit engineering selling  general and administrative amortization of identifiable intangible assets severance charges impairment charges fixed assets and other impairment charges goodwill operating income loss other income expense  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes and minority interests income tax expense income loss from continuing operations before minority interests the following table sets forth our statement of operations data as a percentage of net sales

table of contents net sales increased million  or  to million  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased million  or in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as discussed above  we acquired merix asia on september  the timing of the acquisition  combined with the one month lag in accounting for this segment see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  means that these operations were not included in fiscal and fiscal only included weeks  whereas in fiscal  the results of operations were included in our results of operations for the entire year 
this is the primary reason for the variation in revenue  cost of sales  gross profit and operating expenses in the three year period 
in addition  we acquired merix san jose in december  which contributed to the increased revenue in fiscal compared to fiscal see segment information below for additional information 
our fiscal revenues also reflected improvements in unit sales and pricing at certain segments as detailed below  as well as increases in quick turn and premium revenues as compared to fiscal quick turn and premium revenues include revenues from products that sell at a premium over our standard base price as a result of rapid prototype manufacturing or the request by our customers to compress lead time for higher volume orders 
these factors are discussed in more detail below 
our fiscal net sales reflect increased demand for both volume and quick turn services business at merix oregon as compared to fiscal unit shipments at merix oregon were higher in fiscal than in fiscal segment information net sales by segment were as follows in thousands fiscal year ended  may  may  may  merix oregon merix san jose merix asia gross profit by segment was as follows in thousands fiscal year ended  may  may  may  merix oregon merix san jose merix asia total assets by segment were as follows in thousands may  may  merix oregon merix san jose merix asia 
table of contents per unit information we define unit as the number of panel layers  which is the number of panels multiplied by average layer counts 
percentage increases decreases in unit volume and pricing were as follows fiscal compared to fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal merix oregon unit volume average unit pricing merix san jose unit volume average unit pricing merix asia unit volume n a average unit pricing n a overall unit volume average unit pricing the decline in the overall average unit pricing in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the addition of merix asia sales for all of fiscal as compared to only weeks in fiscal  as the unit prices of the merix asia products are lower than those of merix oregon and merix san jose 
this factor was partially offset by increased sales of higher priced  quick turn products and a shift in our product mix to more technologically advanced boards 
also  during the first quarter of fiscal  we experienced a significant increase in the cost of copper laminate used in the production process  which resulted in us increasing the pricing on a significant portion of our products in the second half of fiscal  particularly in asia 
the overall increase in unit shipments in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the addition of new customers to merix asia 
unit shipments also increased due to generally improved market demand in fiscal as compared to fiscal  and increased layer count resulting from higher technology 
merix oregon and merix san jose the decrease in unit volume at merix oregon in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from the combined effect of decreased demand of high layer count panels that was somewhat offset by an increase in higher technology hdi panels  which inherently have a lower layer count  resulting in the shipment of fewer panel layers 
merix oregon average pricing increased as a result of an increase in shipment of higher technology hdi panels which  due to their high capacity usage  garner higher market prices 
unit volume in san jose decreased while average pricing increased in fiscal compared to fiscal due primarily to an increase in higher technology hdi panel shipments  which garner higher pricing and utilize higher capacity when compared to standard panels 
merix asia the improvement in unit volume in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to the fact that we only had weeks of activity reported in fiscal compared to a full year in fiscal see also the discussion regarding discontinued operations below 
merix asia has contributed to our overall increase in sales as we are now able to offer higher volume  lower cost production capabilities to historic north american merix customers 
the increase in unit volume was partially offset by management s decision during the last three quarters of fiscal to disengage from unprofitable products  primarily related to higher laminate costs  or products that it believed would not reach acceptable profitability in a reasonable period of time 
the orders existing at the time of purchasing merix asia were heavily weighted to the automotive industry  which is generally a lower technology and lower margin business 
we purposely begun shifting 
table of contents the merix asia order mix to higher technology  higher gross margin customers  which contributed to the increase in average unit pricing in asia in fiscal compared to fiscal in addition  in the second half of fiscal  we were able to effect price increases on a portion of our book of business to help absorb a portion of the increased copper laminate costs  which occurred primarily in the first two quarters of fiscal net sales by end market the following table shows  for the periods indicated  the amount of net sales to each of our principal end user markets and their percentage of our consolidated net sales dollars in thousands fiscal year ended may  may  may  communications networking computing peripherals industrial medical defense aerospace automotive other the increases in the markets were primarily due to the increases in unit volume and pricing as indicated above 
the growth in the automotive  computing peripherals and other markets in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted from the addition of merix asia on september  we have also targeted the higher technology defense aerospace markets as a platform for merix north america s growth  which has caused sales in this category to increase 
communications and networking remains our largest market segment and  while decreasing as a percentage our total business due to the inclusion of a full year of merix asia results  it grew in fiscal when compared to fiscal net sales by geographic region net sales by geographic region are defined by the region where the product is manufactured 
accordingly  net sales by geographic region are the same as net sales by segment 
cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales includes manufacturing costs  such as materials  labor both direct and indirect and factory overhead 
a number of costs labor  utilities  manufacturing supplies  etc 
incurred by merix asia are denominated in either hong kong dollars or the chinese renminbi 
changes in these currencies relative to the us dollar affect our profitability 
cost of sales increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increases in fiscal compared to fiscal and in fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily due to the increases in revenue as discussed above 
in addition  the increase in fiscal was affected by an increase in copper laminate costs  which occurred primarily in the first quarter of fiscal and a shift in mix to higher technology products that require higher cost materials and additional labor to produce 

table of contents our gross profit as a percentage of net sales by segment was as follows fiscal year ended  may  may  may  merix oregon merix san jose merix asia n a overall merix oregon and merix san jose the increases in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for merix oregon and merix san jose in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily related to improved market demand and increasing unit prices  as well as a shift in mix to sales of more profitable products as discussed above 
we also increased our mix of hdi products  which are more difficult to manufacture and command higher prices than our more traditional pcb business 
these increases were partially offset by increases in raw material prices  primarily copper laminate 
the effect on merix oregon and merix san jose due to the increases in copper laminate prices was not as significant as it was for merix asia as copper laminate is a smaller percentage of the overall product cost at merix oregon and merix san jose than at merix asia 
in addition  these segments have been more successful in the passing along of the increases in copper costs through higher unit pricing 
the increases in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal were primarily due to increased utilization of production capacity as sales volumes increased 
higher utilization of capacity increases gross profit because it results in a lower cost per unit produced 
the increase in gross profit was offset by purchase accounting adjustments of million at merix asia  employee incentive compensation of million and the effect of the decrease in average pricing at merix oregon 
merix asia the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of net sales for merix asia in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily related to higher raw material costs  principally copper laminate  which was affected by a sharp rise in copper prices 
merix asia also incurred increased outsourcing costs in fiscal in order to meet demand from its growing revenue base 
merix asia s gross profit as a percentage of net sales is lower than merix oregon and merix san jose partially due to the fact that it does not manufacture any higher priced  quick turn services or any significant volumes of technologically advanced products  which generate higher margins 
currently  merix asia only produces full lead time products 
to the extent we are successful in transitioning away from merix asia s current lower technology products to the relatively higher technology products  we anticipate that gross profit as a percentage of net sales will improve 
engineering costs engineering costs include indirect labor  materials and overhead to support customer design and the development of new manufacturing processes required to meet our customers technology requirements  as well as to support our current manufacturing processes 
engineering costs increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and decreased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal 
table of contents the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to having a full year of activity at merix asia in fiscal the decrease in engineering expense in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to a reduction in headcount  largely offset by increases related to acquisitions 
selling  general and administrative costs selling  general and administrative sg a costs include indirect labor  travel  outside services and overhead incurred in our sales  marketing  management and administrative support functions 
sg a costs increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased million  or  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily related to the addition of merix asia  increased salaries and related costs due to an increase in corporate headcount to support global operations and increased stock based compensation due to the adoption of sfas no 
r in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  fiscal included increased sarbanes oxley sox compliance fees due to the initial implementation of sox in merix asia and increased legal fees related to securities litigation 
sg a costs in fiscal also included million for a signing bonus for our new chief executive officer 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily attributed to the addition of million of expenses as a result of acquiring merix asia during fiscal  as well as incremental expenses of approximately million due to the inclusion of a full fiscal year related to merix san jose during fiscal in addition  labor expenses increased in merix oregon by approximately million and sales commissions paid by merix oregon increased by million during fiscal due to increased sales levels 
fiscal also included restructuring charges of million as a result of actions taken during the first quarter of fiscal these increases were partially offset by a million charge in fiscal related to the abandonment of a business opportunity in asia 
amortization of identifiable intangible assets amortization of identifiable intangible assets was million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and the million decrease in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily because merix san jose customer intangibles were fully amortized midway through fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to the inclusion of a full fiscal year of amortization related to the merix san jose intangibles in fiscal compared to a half year during fiscal  which resulted in increased amortization of approximately million  and a million increase related to the amortization of merix asia s intangible assets 
our identifiable intangible assets balance at may  was million and current amortization is approximately million per quarter 

table of contents severance charges severance charges of million in fiscal primarily related to the resignation of our former chief executive officer in the third quarter of fiscal and the resignation of our chief executive officer of our asia operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal total severance charges included the following a lump sum cash payment of million and non cash stock based compensation of million related to the issuance of stock based awards upon the resignation of our former chief executive officer  recruiting fees of  related to a new chief executive officer  million of cash severance related to the termination of another employee  and million of cash severance related to the resignation of our chief executive officer of our asia operation in the fourth quarter of fiscal severance charges of million were recorded during the first quarter of fiscal to accrue for cost reduction actions that included a reduction in headcount across our manufacturing and support organizations  predominantly in oregon  of approximately positions 
impairment charges on fixed assets and other in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million impairment charge related primarily to the property  plant and equipment and land use rights of our hong kong facility  which is part of our merix asia operating segment 
due to continuing and forecasted future operating losses  we performed an impairment analysis pursuant to sfas no 
we primarily utilized market value analyses to determine the fair value of the assets 
in addition  the million charge includes million related to certain assets at our oregon facility which were determined to have limited future use 
goodwill impairment based on our fourth quarter review of the fair value of our merix san jose and merix asia operating segment net assets and their related book value  a million charge for goodwill impairment was recorded 
in estimating the fair value of the operating segments net assets  we utilized a present value of cash flow projections methodology 
the declines in the estimated fair values of the operating segments resulted from lower historical operating results than previously anticipated and lower future estimated cash flows 
the million charge consisted of a million charge for merix san jose and a million charge for merix asia 
debt extinguishment costs debt extinguishment costs of million in fiscal related to the early redemption of our million  convertible debenture due may  the prepayment of our million asia term loan and the prepayment of our million asia revolving loan 
interest income interest income decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the reduction in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was due primarily to lower average cash and investment balances due to cash used for the acquisition of merix asia in september  as well as cash used for the repayment of million of principal on our outstanding debt in fiscal 
table of contents the reduction in interest income in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the reduction in available cash for investing following the merix asia acquisition  largely offset by higher yields on invested balances due to higher interest rates 
interest expense interest expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and increased in fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal due to lower overall borrowing costs resulting from the refinancing of a portion of the merix asia acquisition debt with the lower cost convertible bond offering in may borrowing levels were also reduced in part by cash generated from operations  which was used to repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings 
interest expense in fiscal also included the reversal of  of previously accrued interest due to a reduction in the principal amount of our subordinated promissory note from million to million upon the reduction in the purchase price of merix asia  which occurred in the second quarter of fiscal in addition  future interest expense related to the note will be approximately  per quarter compared to approximately  per quarter prior to the reduction in principal 
the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to additional debt incurred to finance the merix asia acquisition 
other income expense  net net other expense decreased in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily due to the recording of several miscellaneous income items in asia in fiscal the increase in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to foreign currency losses incurred by merix asia subsequent to the acquisition in fiscal income tax expense our provision for income taxes is the result of the mix of profit and loss earned in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate our provision for income taxes based on our projected consolidated results of operations for the full year and we record an adjustment during the current quarter accordingly 
in fiscal  and  our effective income tax rate was  and  respectively 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal of differed from tax computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to various nondeductible charges relating to foreign activities  specifically the impairment of goodwill  certain interest and intercompany transactions and tax losses incurred by some foreign entities for which no benefit has been realized due to increasing the valuation allowance against the related deferred tax asset 
the provision for income taxes in fiscal of differed from tax computed at the federal statutory rate primarily as a result of our mix of profit and loss earned in various tax jurisdictions with a broad range of income tax rates  the release of a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets and the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards 
we did not record a benefit for income taxes during fiscal  as the resulting deferred tax assets were fully reserved against 
we indefinitely reinvest the cumulative undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries 
we will provide for united states income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries to the extent foreign subsidiaries have positive taxable earnings and they are not considered indefinitely reinvested outside of the united 
table of contents states 
at may   the cumulative earnings and profits of foreign subsidiaries was a taxable deficit and there were no dividends from foreign subsidiaries during fiscal accordingly  no us income tax on earnings of foreign subsidiaries was provided 
china passed a unified enterprise income tax law in march the new law takes effect on january  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the newly enacted rates were applied to the existing deferred tax balance and the related valuation allowance 
as a result  the deferred tax balance increased by million with an offsetting increase in the valuation allowance 
discontinued operations on september   merix holding hong kong limited merix hong kong entered into an agreement with citi power investment limited citi power to sell merix hong kong s shareholding interest in the lomber single sided manufacturing facility located in huizhou city in the prc lomber facility for a nominal amount 
also on september   merix hong kong entered into an agreement with excel hero china limited excel to sell its shareholding interest in its single sided manufacturing facility located in dongguan city in the prc dongguan facility for a nominal amount 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we recorded the related assets and liabilities as current assets and liabilities on our balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value  less cost to sell  upon being classified as discontinued operations 
the combined net book value of the dongguan and lomber facilities was approximately million upon their classification as discontinued operations and their fair value  less selling costs was determined to be approximately  accordingly  during the quarter ended november   we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million as a component of loss from discontinued operations and a reversal of a portion of this impairment charge of  was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal upon final disposition of the dongguan and lomber facilities 
the results of operations for the dongguan and lomber facilities have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity and capital resources as of may  consisted of million of cash and cash equivalents  million of short term investments and million available under our revolving bank credit agreement  described below 
we expect our capital resources to be sufficient to fund our operations and known capital requirements for at least one year from may  we have a loan and security agreement with a bank group the loan agreement under which the lenders currently provide a revolving line of credit of up to million based on a borrowing base 
table of contents consisting primarily of our accounts receivable 
the obligations under the loan agreement are secured by substantially all of our us assets 
the borrowings bear interest at a either the prime rate or libor  plus b an additional margin based on certain performance criteria 
as of may   no amounts were outstanding under the loan agreement and the entire million was available for future borrowings on the revolving line of credit 
the loan agreement contains a number of restrictive covenants  all of which we were in compliance with as of may  specifically  our ability to invest or loan additional funds to merix asia is limited  subject to certain conditions  to million in the aggregate at any time 
this limit may negatively affect merix asia and  in particular  our plans to expand the production capacity of our plant in huiyang in the people s republic of china 
we are discussing alternatives with our lenders  although we may not be able to increase this limit 
as of may   we had invested approximately million against this limit 
in fiscal  cash and cash equivalents and short term investments decreased million to million as of may  from million as of may  primarily as a result of the use of million for the purchase of property  plant and equipment  million used for the repayment of debt and million for the repayment of capital lease obligations  partially offset by million of cash generated by operations and million received from the exercise of stock options 
accounts receivable  net of allowances for bad debts  increased million to million as of may  from million as of may   primarily due to an increase in our days sales outstanding 
our days sales outstanding  calculated on a quarterly basis  was days at may  compared to days at may  this increase was partially offset by lower sales in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal inventories  net of obsolescence and other reserves  increased million to million as of may  compared to million as of may  the increase primarily was due to increased consignment inventory at customer locations  as well as increased raw material costs  principally relating to copper laminates  which have risen due to changes in commodity copper prices 
our annualized inventory turnover rate  calculated on a quarterly basis  was times for the quarter ended may  and times for the quarter ended february  accrued compensation decreased million to million as of may  compared to million as of may  this was primarily due to a decrease in the accrual for employee bonuses 
the bonus accrual at may  for fiscal was greater than the bonus accrual at may  was greater than at may  due to better performance relative to bonus targets in fiscal than in fiscal other accrued liabilities decreased million to million as of may  compared to million as of may  the change primarily was due to a million reduction in a payable to the former owner of merix asia 
both parties agreed to offset receivables and payables during fiscal expenditures for property  plant and equipment of million in fiscal primarily consisted of expenditures for upgrading equipment and facilities in merix asia to improve the efficiency of the facilities and to comply with regulations  the upgrading of equipment in north america to improve efficiency of the manufacturing facilities and process higher technology products  as well investing in a new global enterprise resource planning erp system 
we estimate our total capital expenditures in fiscal to be approximately to million  including a significant portion of the approximately million for a project related to significantly expanding both the capacity and the technological capabilities of our huiyang  china based factory 
we anticipate that this investment will allow us to expand margins and profitably grow our revenues in this region and accelerate merix asia s technological capabilities to better support our customers needs

recently issued accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included in part ii  item of this form k 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
significant accounting policies and estimates underlying the accompanying consolidated financial statements include revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of excess and obsolete inventory and idle facilities  the valuation and impairment of long lived assets  the valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets  stock based compensation  warranty liabilities  legal contingencies  and accounting for income taxes 
it is reasonably possible that the estimates we make may change in the future 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon the shipment of our products to the customer provided that we have received a purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred to the customer  collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured  product returns are reasonably estimable  there are no further customer acceptance requirements and there are no remaining significant obligations 
provisions for estimated sales returns and adjustments are made at the point of revenue recognition based on historical 
table of contents experience 
sales adjustments are charged against consolidated net sales  disputed freight charges are charged against cost of sales and other customer accommodations are typically charged against operating expenses 
other customer accommodations represent additional costs incurred beyond the sale of the product to uphold the quality of the products sold and to maintain customer satisfaction 
consignment sales are recognized at the time that all criteria of revenue recognition described above have been satisfied by the consignee 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make ongoing estimates relating to the collectibility of the accounts receivable balance and we maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the inability of the customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical bad debt experience  ongoing credit evaluations of customers and changes in our customers businesses 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to identify uncollectible receivables  and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
valuation of excess and obsolete inventories and idle facilities provisions for inventories are made to reduce excess inventories to their estimated net realizable values  as necessary 
a change in customer demand for inventory is the primary indicator for reductions in inventory carrying values 
we record inventory provisions based on historical experiences with customers  the ability to utilize inventory in other programs  the ability to redistribute inventory back to the suppliers and current and forecasted demand for the inventory 
on may   we adopted sfas no 
 inventory costs an amendment of arb no 
 chapter  which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense  freight  handling costs and wasted material spoilage and requires that those items be recognized as current period charges 
additionally  sfas no 
requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities 
we are required to estimate the amount of idle capacity and allocate and expense amounts in the current period 
pursuant to sfas no 
 during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we expensed million related to abnormally low production volumes 
valuation and impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  our long lived assets to be held and used in the business are reviewed for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we consider a trend of unsatisfactory operating results that are not in line with management s expectations to be our primary indicator of potential impairment 
when an indicator of impairment is noted  assets are evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows 
if the sum of expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
losses on assets to be disposed of are determined in a similar manner  except that the fair values are reduced for disposal costs 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to identify indicators of impairment and to estimate discounted future cash flows 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of impairment charges in fiscal and fiscal there were no impairment charges recorded during fiscal 
table of contents valuation and impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized 
instead  they are measured for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter  or when events indicate that an impairment exists 
as required by sfas no 
 in our impairment test of goodwill  we compare the fair value of the applicable reporting unit to its carrying value 
if the carrying value of the reporting entity exceeds the estimate of fair value  we calculate the impairment as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill over its implied fair value 
in the impairment tests for other indefinite lived intangible assets  we compare the estimated fair value of the indefinite lived intangible assets to the carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the estimate of fair value  we calculate impairment as the excess of the carrying value over the estimate of fair value 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding goodwill impairment charges in fiscal intangible assets that are determined to have definite lives are amortized over their useful lives and are measured for impairment only when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired in accordance with sfas no 
 as discussed above 
stock based compensation on may   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards granted to our employees and directors based on the estimated fair value of the award on the grant date 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method as provided by sfas no 
r and  accordingly  financial statement amounts for the prior periods presented in this form k have not been restated to reflect the fair value method of expensing stock based compensation 
under this method  the provisions of sfas no 
r apply to all awards granted or modified after the date of adoption 
in addition  the unrecognized expense of awards not yet vested at the date of adoption is recognized in net income in the periods after the date of adoption over the remainder of the requisite service period 
our deferred stock based compensation balance of million as of may   which was accounted for under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  was reclassified to common stock upon the adoption of sfas no 
r 
as of may   unrecognized stock based compensation related to outstanding  but unvested stock options and restricted stock awards was million and million  respectively  which will be recognized over the weighted average remaining vesting periods of years and years  respectively 
prior to may   we accounted for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method as prescribed by apb opinion no 
and related interpretations 
upon the adoption of sfas no 
r  we maintained our method of valuation for stock option awards using the black scholes option pricing model which has historically been used for the purpose of providing pro forma financial disclosures in accordance with sfas no 
on may   our board of directors accelerated vesting of outstanding underwater employee stock options with exercise prices greater than per share 
approximately million options  or approximately of the total outstanding options as of may   with varying remaining vesting schedules  were subject to this acceleration and became immediately exercisable 
as a result of this acceleration  we estimated that it would reduce the amount of compensation expense recorded due to the effects of sfas no 
r by approximately  for fiscal and an additional  in total for subsequent fiscal years 
this acceleration only related to specific underwater options and  accordingly  is not representative of the overall impact that sfas no 
r will have on our results of operations  cash flows or liquidity 
the use of the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock option awards requires us to make judgments on assumptions regarding the risk free interest rate  expected dividend yield  expected term and expected volatility over the expected term of the award 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but 
table of contents these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of expense could be materially different in the future 
compensation expense is only recognized on awards that ultimately vest 
therefore  we have reduced the compensation expense to be recognized over the vesting period for anticipated future forfeitures 
forfeiture estimates are based on historical forfeiture patterns 
we update our forfeiture estimates as warranted and recognize any changes to accumulated compensation expense in the period of change 
if actual forfeitures differ significantly from our estimates  our results of operations could be materially impacted 
warranty liabilities we generally warrant our products for a period of up to twelve months from the point at which the rights and rewards of ownership of the product is transferred to the customer 
however  our merix asia facility generally honors warranty claims for a period of up to three years from the point at which the product is sold 
we record a liability for the estimated cost of the warranty upon transfer of ownership of our products to the customer 
the warranty liability is calculated based on our historical experience of expenses resulting from the warranty program for the twelve preceding months for merix oregon and merix san jose and for the preceding three year period for merix asia 
legal contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  all legal contingencies  which are judged to be both probable and estimable  are recorded as liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets based on our best estimates of the costs of resolving or disposing of the underlying claims 
we regularly monitor our estimates in light of current developments and changes in circumstances and we adjust our legal reserves accordingly 
if no particular amount is determined to constitute our best estimate of a particular legal contingency  a range of our estimate of the costs of resolving or disposing of the underlying claim is disclosed and we will accrue for the low end of the range of costs  unless otherwise disclosed 
legal reserves are expensed in the period in which they occur 
considerable management judgment and assumptions are necessary to estimate legal contingency reserves 
accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
it is our policy to accrue legal fees when it is probable that we will have to defend against known claims or allegations and we can reasonably estimate the amount of anticipated expense 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized
