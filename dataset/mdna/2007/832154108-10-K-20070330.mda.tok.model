we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalent investment balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
we may require additional funds to support our working capital requirements or for other purposes and may seek to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financing or from other sources 
if additional financing is needed  we cannot assure that such financing will be available to us at commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our corporate headquarters  which includes our principal administrative  sales and marketing  customer support and research and development facilities  is located in aliso viejo  california 
we have leased this space through may we also lease approximately  square feet in watsonville  california under a new lease that expires september  we are currently working on a new operating lease for our facility in lee s summit  missouri to replace the lease that expired in june as of december   we had no debt and no long term liabilities

we have not recorded any liability for these indemnities  commitments and guarantees in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of results of operations  financial condition and liquidity are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we review our estimates to ensure that the estimates appropriately reflect changes in our business or new information as it becomes available 

table of contents we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition software revenue is recognized in accordance with the statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is probable 
we recognize revenues from sales of our software to oem customers or end users as completed products are shipped and title passes  or from royalties generated as authorized customers duplicate our software  if the other requirements of sop are met 
if the requirements of sop are not met at the date of shipment  revenue is not recognized until these elements are known or resolved 
returns from oem customers are limited to defective goods or goods shipped in error 
historically  oem customer returns have not exceeded the very nominal estimates and reserves 
management reviews available retail channel information and makes a determination of a return provision for sales made to distributors and retailers based on current channel inventory levels and historical return patterns 
certain sales to distributors or retailers are made on a consignment basis 
revenue for consignment sales are not recognized until sell through to the final customer is established 
we have few multiple elements agreement for which we have contracted to provide a perpetual license for use of proprietary software  to provide non recurring engineering  and in some cases to provide software maintenance post contract support 
for multiple element agreements  vendor specific objective evidence for all contract elements is reviewed and the timing of the individual element revenue streams is determined and recognized consistent with sop product sales directly to end users are recognized upon delivery 
end users have a thirty day right of return  but such returns are reasonably estimable and have historically been immaterial 
we also provide technical support to our customers 
such costs have historically been insignificant 
service revenues include sales of consulting services  website hosting and fulfillment 
we recognize service revenues as services are provided or as milestones are delivered and accepted by our customers 
accounts receivable we sell our products worldwide 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history  the customer s current credit worthiness and various other factors  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
we estimate credit losses and maintain a bad debt reserve based upon these estimates 
while such credit losses have historically been within our estimated reserves  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if not  this could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
goodwill we have adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  and no impairment was identified 
as a result of the adoption  we are no longer required to amortize goodwill 
prior to the adoption of sfas  goodwill was amortized over years 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we review the recoverability of the carrying value of goodwill at least annually or whenever events or circumstances indicate a potential impairment 
our annual impairment testing date is december recoverability of goodwill is determined by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the carrying value of the underlying net assets in the reporting units 
if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined to be less than the fair value of its net assets  goodwill is deemed impaired and an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying value of goodwill exceeds the difference between the estimated fair value of the reporting unit and the fair value of its other assets and liabilities 
at december   we elected to write off all goodwill associated with our services sector  or  the consulting portion of our services sector has been de emphasized and is no longer considered a strategic element of our go forward plan 
the amount of the write off is included in general and administrative expenses 
we determined that we did not have any impairment of goodwill as related to the products sector at december  estimates of reporting unit fair value are based upon market capitalization and therefore are volatile being sensitive to market fluctuations 
to the extent that our market capitalization decreases significantly or the allocation of value to our reporting units change  we could be required to write off some or all of our goodwill 

table of contents deferred income taxes we account for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
the measurement of the deferred items is based on enacted tax laws 
in the event the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and the tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a deferred tax asset  sfas no 
requires an evaluation of the probability of being able to realize the future benefits indicated by such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
at the end of  we had a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
based on our assessment of all available evidence  we concluded that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be fully realized in the future 
this conclusion is based primarily on our improving financial performance and projected income in the future years 
as a result  we released all of our valuation allowance in the release of the valuation allowance decreased our tax expense in stock based compensation we currently account for the issuance of stock options to employees using the fair market value method according to sfas no

in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets sfas no 
 which provides an approach to simplify efforts to obtain hedge like offset accounting 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
the statement requires an entity to recognize a servicing asset or servicing liability each time it undertakes an obligation to service a financial asset by entering into a servicing contract in certain situations  requires that a separately recognized servicing asset or servicing liability be initially measured at fair value  if practicable  permits an entity to choose either the amortization method or the fair value method for subsequent measurement for each class of separately recognized servicing assets or servicing liabilities  permits at initial adoption a one time reclassification of available for sale securities to trading securities by an entity with recognized servicing rights  provided the securities reclassified offset the entity s exposure to changes in the fair value of the servicing assets or liabilities  and requires separate presentation of servicing assets and servicing liabilities subsequently measured at fair value in the balance sheet and additional disclosures for all separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
sfas no 
is effective for all separately recognized servicing assets and liabilities as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after september   with earlier adoption permitted in certain circumstances 
the statement also describes the manner in which it should be initially applied 
we do not believe that sfas no 
will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines the fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is encouraged  provided that we have not yet issued financial statements for that fiscal year  including any financial statements for an interim period within that fiscal year 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact sfas may have on our results of operations and financial position

will have on our results of operations and financial position 
in september  the united states securities and exchange commission sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
this sab provides guidance on the consideration of the effects of prior year misstatements in quantifying current year misstatements for the purpose of a materiality assessment 
sab establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors based on the effects of each of the company s balance sheets and statement of operations and the related financial statement disclosures 
the sab permits existing public companies to record the cumulative effect of initially applying this approach in the first year ending after november  by recording the necessary correcting adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of the beginning of that year with the offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
additionally  the use of the cumulative effect transition method requires detailed disclosure of the nature and amount of each individual error being corrected through the cumulative adjustment and how and when it arose 
we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact sab may have on our results of operations or financial position 
in october  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation to clarify diversity in practice on the presentation of different types of taxes in the financial statements 
the task force concluded that  for taxes within the scope of the issue  a company may adopt a policy of presenting taxes either gross within revenue or net 
that is  it may include charges to customers for taxes within revenues and the charge for the taxes from the taxing authority within cost of sales  or  alternatively  it may net the charge to the customer and the charge from the taxing authority 
if taxes subject to eitf are significant  a company is required to disclose its accounting policy for presenting taxes and the amounts of such taxes that are recognized on a gross basis 
the guidance in this consensus is effective for the first interim reporting period beginning after december  the first quarter of our fiscal year 
we do not expect the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flow 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure at fair value many financial instruments and certain other items that are not currently required to be measured at fair value 
subsequent changes in fair value for designated items will be required to be reported in earnings in the current period 
sfas no 
also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements for similar types of assets and liabilities measured at fair value 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently assessing the effect of implementing this guidance  which directly depends on the nature and extent of eligible items elected to be measured at fair value  upon initial application of the standard on january  
table of contents item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk our financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents 
at december   the carrying values of our financial instruments approximated fair values based on current market prices and rates 
because of their short duration  changes in market interest rates would not have a material effect on fair value 
it is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments 
we do not currently have any significant foreign currency exposure as we do not transact business in foreign currencies 
as such  we do not have significant currency exposure at december
