on november   we laid off employees spread throughout various departments 
along with an additional six employees who recently left us through attrition and were not replaced  our overall personnel headcount was reduced by  resulting in an approximately reduction in our us based workforce 
annual expense savings from this reduction in force  including salary and benefits  total an estimated million 
the expense savings will be reflected primarily in selling and general and administrative expenses and amortization of non recoupable production costs cost of sales on a go forward basis 
image entertainment  inc we laid off both of our two uk employees and closed our image uk content acquisitions office in november  saving annual expenses of approximately  of the  in savings   is compensation related and is not included in the million in annual expense savings from reduced headcount discussed above 
the expense savings will be reflected in general and administrative expenses on a go forward basis 
the uk office was used primarily as a focal point for the acquisition of programming outside of north america 
we believe that a realignment of our acquisition strategy allowed us to close this satellite office without any material negative effect on our overall acquisition efforts 
we are continuing to use one of the employees as a consultant tasked with the acquisition of programming outside of north america 
we made changes in our freight policy and reduced distribution facility expenses  such as temporary labor  employee overtime  utilities and cost of supplies 
we expect an immediate annual expense savings from these initiatives of approximately  the expense savings will be reflected in cost of sales on a go forward basis 
we successfully implemented our vendor management inventory vmi system  which affords us approximately  in annual savings based upon overall reduced freight costs 
we appointed sonopress as our exclusive provider of warehousing and distribution services  which we expect to reduce our replication and distribution costs 
see sonopress fulfillment services agreement and planned closure of las vegas facility below 
we have reduced third party professional services that will save us approximately  annually beginning january  we have implemented our content rights management system and expect future comparative savings from outside consultants to be  annually beginning in our fourth quarter ended march  we recorded one time charges for severance associated with the layoff of our employees and accrued for the remaining rent of our image uk office totaling approximately  in our third quarter ended december  the one time charges were reflected in selling expenses in the amount of approximately  and general and administrative expenses in the amount of approximately  in the statements of operations for fiscal disc replication agreement and related advance on june   we entered into a five year disc replication agreement with sonopress 
sonopress serves as the exclusive manufacturer of our dvds 
this will ultimately include the hd dvd and blu ray disc high definition formats as well 
sonopress is also the primary manufacturer of our cd requirements 
on june   we received an interest free million advance against future dvd manufacturing from sonopress  to be repaid at per dvd manufactured  plus payment of a administrative fee per dvd manufactured until the advance is fully repaid 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
sonopress fulfillment services agreement and planned closure of las vegas facility in conjunction with our july strategy to transition replication services from deluxe to sonopress  we conducted a strategic analysis that assessed the potential benefits of also transferring all warehousing and distribution operations from our las vegas distribution center to a distribution facility located in pleasant prairie  wisconsin previously owned and operated by deluxe that sonopress acquired on april  our analysis showed expanded distribution capabilities and reduced operating expenses and freight costs 
moreover  the potential scalability of distribution services without corresponding capital expenditures was extremely attractive to us  especially as we seek to move into home video distribution of theatrical motion pictures 
we expect to realize freight savings as a result of the move to sonopress facility being centrally located in the midwest  and because of the help from sonopress well developed transportation management services group 
in addition  we anticipate that operating expenses will decrease as a result of the termination of approximately full time employees plus temporary labor in las vegas  the anticipated sublease of our las vegas facility  and the elimination of costs related thereto 
ultimately  the recently acquired yet historically tested sonopress facility provides us with a strategic means to increase our distribution throughput  eliminate capital expenditure requirements and capitalize on cost savings 
image entertainment  inc one time termination benefits totaling approximately  will be provided to current employees who are involuntarily terminated under the terms of this restructuring 
these employees will be required to render service until a specific date in order to receive the termination benefits 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  a liability for the termination benefits shall be measured initially at the communication date  which was april   based on the fair value of the liability as of the termination date 
the resulting liability will be recognized ratably over the future service period 
we plan on using our warehouse assets as we to continue to store and distribute our products until the transfer of inventories to sonopress is complete  now estimated to be by july  the decision to restructure our distribution operations by engaging sonopress triggered an asset impairment as determined under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
much of our warehouse and distribution equipment will be abandoned before the end of its previously estimated useful life 
in accordance with sfas no 
 depreciation and amortization estimates will be revised to reflect the use of the assets over their shortened useful lives 
at march   the net book value of assets that we estimate will be abandoned after the cessation of warehousing and distribution activities in nevada totaled approximately  we continue to classify these assets as a component of property  equipment and improvements and separately classify the accelerated depreciation expense as restructuring expense within continuing operating expenses 
as this is not a discontinued operation  but rather a closing of a plant and related activities  the net book value will be amortized and depreciated down to its estimated salvage value 
we notified our las vegas landlord of our intent to vacate the facility and sublease the space on march  our landlord is open to various options  including potential termination of the lease  if an appropriate new tenant is found 
we signed an exclusive representation agreement with ipg  a commercial real estate broker  for the potential sublease of the facility on or about may  fees to the agent will be of lease rentals or if both sides of the sublease transaction are completed by ipg 
we have been informed by las vegas based real estate professionals that our lease is below current market rates  thus providing compelling sublease and or lease exit options for us 
beginning at the end of may  ipg began marketing the facility to prospective tenants under a sublease 
it is currently anticipated that the facility will be available to a new tenant  assuming one is found  by october in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for leases  we will recognize a liability at the date we cease using the facility at its fair value 
as the lease is an operating lease  we will determine fair value based on the remaining lease payments reduced by actual or estimated sublease rentals 
we estimate our cease use date to be september  private placement of senior convertible note and warrant on august   in a private offering  we issued to portside a senior convertible note in the principal amount of  and a related warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock  and on november   we entered into an amendment and exchange agreement with portside  which agreement modified certain terms in the transaction documents and provided for a replacement warrant to be issued in exchange for the warrant previously issued to portside 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
exclusive distribution agreement with relativity media and planned issuance of common shares distribution agreement 
on august   we entered into a year distribution agreement with relativity media 
the agreement calls for relativity media to provide us with the exclusive home video and digital distribution rights to motion pictures wholly financed through or otherwise under the control of relativity media  in exchange for which we will be solely responsible for all distribution services for the dvd home video and digital release of each film 
relativity media is a financing  consulting and production company that utilizes both traditional and non traditional channels in order to raise production and distribution funds  both for major studios and independent production entities 
to date  relativity media has structured and consummated more that billion in production slate financings 
it most recently provided financing for image entertainment  inc smokin aces catch and release talladega nights the ballad of ricky bobby rv the fast and furious tokyo drift monster house based in part on the advice of our financial advisors and our expectations of the production budget size and type of talent associated with the titles that are to be delivered under the agreement  we project this north american home video and digital distribution output agreement will generate significant dvd and digital revenues over the next few years  assuming relativity media delivers titles to us per our contract 
the agreement called for relativity media to provide us with the names of three titles within seven days after the execution of the agreement 
relativity media has not yet delivered titles for us to release under the agreement 
the first group of theatrical motion pictures to be released by us under the agreement was initially projected to be in the second half of calendar  or during our fiscal this timing is dependent upon relativity securing titles for us in the near term 
the agreement calls for us to exclusively distribute all home video and digital video formats for motion pictures controlled by relativity media that are not part of a finance package provided to a major studio or their affiliates  propelling us beyond our existing position as a leading supplier of independent dvd programming to become a significant provider of major motion pictures to the home entertainment industry 
per the agreement  relativity media is to deliver us a minimum of three titles in calendar  and a minimum of seven titles each year thereafter 
each title distributed throughout the ten year output term will carry a ten year exclusive distribution term from the date of release 
we will oversee post production specifically authoring and compression and development of ancillary materials creative design  replication  marketing and advertising  sales  distribution and collections for each picture 
on august   in connection with the relativity media agreement  we issued a warrant to a third party exclusive rights finder 
the term of the warrant was years and had a strike price of  the closing price of our common stock on the date of grant 
the fair value of the warrant was  using the black scholes valuation model 
the warrant has been converted via cashless exercise into  shares of our common stock as of june  we capitalized the fair value of the warrant as a component of other assets with a corresponding credit to additional paid in capital 
we will amortize the asset to cost of sales over the related revenues generated from the relativity media titles 
stock purchase agreement 
as a material inducement to enter into the distribution agreement  we agreed to issue relativity media  shares of our common stock  which are registered on a registration statement on form s in order to secure relativity media s performance under our agreement  we have been granted a security interest in the shares pursuant to a security agreement  the shares have been pledged to us pursuant to a stock pledge agreement  and a restrictive legend will be placed on the stock certificates representing the shares restricting their transfer until designated title delivery  box office performance  financial and or payment requirements are met 
to date  relativity media has not provided us with the first titles to be released under the agreement and to date  we have not physically issued the shares to relativity media 
liquidity and capital resources our working capital has historically been generated from the following sources operating cash flows availability under our revolving line of credit private placement of debt and equity instruments advances from our disc manufacturer image entertainment  inc sony bmg recoupment of royalty advance for international sublicense rights 
we received a million initial royalty advance under the sony bmg agreement in march  fully recoupable from revenues generated by sony bmg against quarterly royalties due to us under the agreement 
based upon actual quarterly sales of our programming in the territories  sony bmg recoups quarterly royalties from the million previously advanced 
sony bmg had provided additional quarterly royalty advances such that for the first three years of the agreement term through december   the advance outstanding to us at any given time was maintained at million 
during fiscal and according to our agreement  sony bmg reduced  through recoupment  the outstanding royalty advance without making additional quarterly royalty advances 
once the entire royalty advance is recouped  sony bmg will continue to pay quarterly royalties based on revenues generated 
we must repay any outstanding unrecouped royalty advance within days following the final sony bmg reporting at the end of sony bmg s term and sell off period 
at march   approximately  of the last million advance is classified as a component of deferred revenue in the accompanying balance sheet 
subsequent event new revolving credit and term loan facility 
on may   we entered into a three year loan and security agreement with wachovia  which provides us with a revolving line of credit up to million  with an accordion feature to increase the line to million at our option  subject to the terms and conditions of the agreement 
actual borrowing availability is based on eligible trade accounts receivable levels 
the wachovia revolving credit facility replaces the existing facility with wells fargo 
borrowings bear interest at either the prime rate plus up to or  at our option  libor plus up to  subject to minimum borrowing levels 
the level of interest rate margin to prime or libor is dependent upon our future financial performance as measured by ebitda  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  as defined in the agreement 
the targets under the agreement exempt certain expenses  including costs incurred in our corporate sale process 
the wachovia agreement is subject to early termination fees  based upon the initial maximum facility amount of million  of if terminated within the first year of the term and if terminated thereafter through the end of the three year term 
the agreement also imposes restrictions on such items as encumbrances and liens  payment of dividends  other indebtedness  stock repurchases and capital expenditures and requires us to comply with minimum financial and operating covenants 
any outstanding borrowings are secured by our assets 
at march   we had cash of  and borrowing availability of million under our revolving credit facility with our then lender wells fargo 
comparatively  at march   we had cash of  and borrowing availability of million and million  respectively  under our revolving credit and term loan facilities with wells fargo 
at march   we had no borrowings under the revolving credit facility with wells fargo 
other sources and uses of working capital for fiscal the following factors contributed to the use of million in operating cash and million in investing cash during fiscal our pretax loss from operations was million for fiscal includes the write off of million in assets associated with our distribution agreement with source entertainment as a result of their bankruptcy filing 
includes legal  investment banking and other expenses of million associated with the negotiation of the btp merger agreement 
includes  in expenses associated with the lions gate proxy contest and special committee of our board  as well as the ongoing process of evaluating strategic alternatives  including our potential sale 
we funded feature film production of million 
we had a million increase in trade payables and accrued liabilities offset in part by our paid down of accrued royalties  distribution fees and music publishing fees by million 
approximately million in royalties previously advanced to us and classified as deferred revenues were recouped by sony bmg during fiscal beginning with our fourth quarter ended march   and in accordance with our agreement  sony bmg has been recouping their initial million royalty advance to us and not providing us with replacement advances as they had done prior to the quarter ended march  through march   sony bmg has recouped million  instead of re advancing us this amount 
image entertainment  inc we incurred million in capital expenditures in our continuing effort to improve our information technology and distribution system infrastructure 
adding to the uses of cash above  our gross trade accounts receivables gross of reserves for sales returns and allowances  and doubtful accounts increased to million at march   compared to million at march   as a result of timing of sales within the march quarter 
we financed these expenditures through operating cash flows  our revolving line of credit  borrowings from our new disc manufacturer sonopress and a private placement of debt 
while we had no current outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit with wells fargo since replaced by our new wachovia line  our long term outstanding borrowings from the private placement and the manufacturing advance from sonopress totaled million of which million in related fees were deducted from the proceeds of the private placement 
the million outstanding  of which million may incrementally become due beginning in february and million of which is incrementally due as discs are manufactured we estimate million will be due in the next months represents an increase of approximately million from the million borrowed and classified as a current liability at march  we believe that projected cash flows from operations  borrowing availability under our revolving line of credit  cash on hand  and trade credit will provide the necessary capital to meet our projected cash requirements for at least the next months 
should we find attractive corporate acquisitions  we may seek additional debt or equity financing in order to fund the transaction  in the form of bank financing  convertible debt  or the issuance of convertible preferred or common stock 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations thereafter total operating lease obligations    capital lease obligations long term debt obligations    interest convertible debt obligations   licensing and exclusive distribution obligations   employment obligations   total      advances and guarantees included in the table above  under licensing and exclusive distribution agreements  are prepaid and thus recoupable against future royalties  distribution fees and profit participations earned by our exclusive program suppliers in connection with revenues generated by those rights 
as we have historically  we expect to fund these commitments through recoupment of existing advances  our existing bank line of credit  and other working capital 
we do not expect our obligations for property and equipment expenditures  including information technology related expenditures  to exceed million per year 
vendor managed inventory 
under the vmi system  product suppliers are responsible for monitoring  stocking  and fulfilling directly to individual retail stores and outlets 
larger retailers  who have been transacting business via vmi with the major studios for years  are starting to require smaller independents ie product suppliers other than major studios  music labels and mini majors to adopt this method of inventory management 
see change in buying patterns best buy vendor managed inventory vmi program above 
our vmi systems provide timely and accurate sales and inventory data and allow us to maintain proper stocking levels at retail 
in our largest consortium based vmi engagement  with best buy  we have seen reduced returns and increased inventory turns 
with respect to long term benefits  we expect the implementation of vmi relationships with retail customers to image entertainment  inc sell more units and reduce returned items by better matching inventory to real time demand reduce potential overproduction and excess inventory quantities by more accurately forecasting orders reduce processing and warehousing fees by maintaining a leaner supply chain increase our importance as a direct supplier of participating retail partners source entertainment  inc chapter bankruptcy filing and related asset impairment 
we have written down the net book value of assets related to our distribution agreement with source entertainment at march   as facts and circumstances lead us to conclude that recoverability of the net book value is in now in doubt 
we have paid and accrued approximately million for mechanical licensing fees for audio programs that we now believe have not been paid by source as contractually required 
in previous reported periods we also recorded a corresponding recoupable music publishing advance for these anticipated music publishing payments  which we were to recoup according to a february  settlement agreement with source 
this agreement granted us the exclusive right to distribute as many additional source branded titles as necessary to fully recoup any outstanding unpaid mechanical licensing and other unrecouped costs 
under the settlement agreement  we would have continued to receive our standard distribution fee on all units sold 
the agreement also gave us the right but not the obligation to discharge any unpaid music publishing fees required 
as we were in control of future source branded programming and could cross promote our cd compilation releases within source s periodic magazine  we believed we could recover all of the distribution and music publishing advances through profit participations from future titles and future sales of previously released titles from source branded programming 
the source affiliate with whom we have the settlement agreement filed for chapter bankruptcy in may while we will continue to seek to operate under the terms of the settlement agreement  we will attempt to perfect this agreement within the bankruptcy courts 
in january  we purchased all of source s rights in the source programs at a ucc sale 
through this foreclosure sale  we purchased source s entire right  title and interest in the already released the source presents hip hop hits volumes  and and the yet to be produced future titles the source presents hip hop hits volume  mics  th anniversary and th anniversary cds four titles yet to be released 
given the uncertainty associated with the source s bankruptcy  we believe that the net book value of our source related assets is now impaired 
accordingly  we have written down the unamortized assets related to our expectation of future profits associated with the release of the four titles we purchased in the foreclosure sale 
accordingly  we recorded a write down of million in the fourth quarter of fiscal the expense is included in cost of sales in the accompanying statement of operations for fiscal long term debt 
long term debt at march  and consisted of the following in thousands subordinated senior convertible note  net of  discount subordinated manufacturing advance obligation  net of  discount less current portion of long term debt  net of discount long term debt less current portion and debt discounts  debt instruments and related covenants 
our loan agreement with wachovia requires us to comply with minimum financial and operating covenants 
we were not required to be in compliance with the covenant establishing a minimum ebitda  as defined by wachovia  as of march  we were in compliance with all financial and operating covenants at march   and expect to be in compliance with all covenants for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we currently do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
generally accepted accounting principles require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from those estimates 
image entertainment  inc we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that involve significant uncertainties  require judgments or estimates that are more difficult for management to determine  or that may produce materially different results when using different assumptions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue upon meeting the recognition requirements of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting by producers or distributors of films and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
revenues from home video distribution are recognized net of an allowance for estimated returns  as well as related costs  in the period in which the product is available for sale by our customers at the point that title and risk of loss transfer to the customer  which is generally upon receipt by the customer  and in the case of new releases  after street date restrictions lapse 
we recognize revenues from domestic and international broadcast licensing and home video sublicensing  as well as associated costs  when the titles are available to the licensee and other recognition requirements of sop are met 
we defer fees received in advance of availability  usually in the case of advances received from sony bmg  digital site  warner music group and other international home video sublicensees  and for broadcast  until other revenue recognition requirements have been satisfied 
provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable are provided at the time of sale 
as of march   deferred revenue totaled  down from  at march  royalty and distribution fees 
for each reporting period  we estimate the ultimate total revenues to be received throughout a title s exclusive license or distribution period from exploitation of that title in multiple home entertainment formats 
while we charge royalty and distribution fee advances to operations as related revenues are earned  estimates of ultimate revenues are important in determining whether we should record additional royalty and distribution fee expense as cost of sales in any given reporting period 
we amortize royalty and distribution fee advances to expense in the same ratio that the current period revenues for a title or group of titles bear to the estimated remaining unrecognized ultimate revenues for that title 
additionally  in circumstances required by sop  we recognize additional amortization to the extent that capitalized advance royalty and distribution fees exceed their estimated fair value in the period when estimated 
we base our estimates of ultimate revenue for each title on the historical performance of that title  similar titles and specific genre performance 
we attempt to reflect in our estimates the most current available information on the title 
we update such estimates based upon the actual results of each format s revenue performance 
estimates of ultimate revenues on a title by title basis are subject to substantial uncertainty 
factors affecting future actual performance include focus from the sales and marketing department including advertising  promotions and price reductions  availability of retail shelf space  retail customer product placement and advertising  maintenance of adequate inventory levels  concert touring by the artist in the case of music related dvds and cds  retail sell through  and ultimately continued end user consumer demand 
any of the above factors can contribute to a title s actual performance exceeding our expectations prior to release or failure to meet pre release expectations 
overestimation of ultimate revenues would cause unamortized costs to be amortized at a slower rate or a delay in adjusting costs to their fair value until such time estimates are reduced  causing unamortized costs to be overstated and increased amortization of costs in a later period 
underestimation of ultimate revenues would cause unamortized costs to be amortized more quickly until ultimate revenue estimates are increased  causing unamortized costs to be understated and decreased amortization of costs in a later period 
inventory valuation 
for each reporting period  we evaluate our ending inventories for excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analysis of historical sales levels by title  format and genre  and projections of future demand 
in addition  we write down inventories that are considered obsolete or overstocked 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost or market value  and result in a new basis in such inventory until sold 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than our projections  additional inventory write downs may be required  and would be reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
future demand will be dependent upon the continued retail customer acceptance of our content  future demand by end user consumer  advertising  promotions and price reductions  market conditions either favorable or unfavorable and future warehouse storage limitations 
should projections of future inventory demand be overstated  the value of inventory would be overstated and current cost of sales understated  with future cost of sales overstated 
conversely  should projections of future demand be understated  the value of inventory would be understated and the current cost of sales overstated  with future cost of sales understated 
image entertainment  inc allowance for sales returns and doubtful accounts receivable 
for each reporting period  we evaluate product sales and accounts receivable to estimate their effect on revenues due to product returns  sales allowances and other credits given and delinquent accounts 
our estimates of product sales that will be returned and the amount of receivables that will ultimately be collected require the exercise of judgment and affect reported revenues and net earnings 
in determining the estimate of product sales that will be returned  we analyze historical returns quantity of returns and time to receive returned product  historical pricing and other credit memo data  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products  including reorder activity 
based on this information  we reserve a percentage of each dollar of product sales where the customer has the right to return such product and receive a credit memo 
actual returns could be different from our estimates and current provisions for sales returns and allowances  resulting in future charges to earnings 
estimates of future sales returns and other credits are subject to substantial uncertainty 
factors affecting actual returns include retailer financial difficulties  the perception of comparatively poor retail performance in one or several retailer locations  limited retail shelf space at various times of the year  inadequate advertising or promotions  retail prices being too high for the perceived quality of the content or other comparable content  the near term release of similar titles  and poor responses to package designs 
underestimation of product sales returns and other credits would result in an overstatement of current revenues and lower revenues in future periods 
conversely  overestimation of product sales returns would result in an understatement of current revenues and higher revenues in future periods 
similarly  we evaluate accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
in performing this evaluation  significant judgments and estimates are involved  including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for our larger customers and an analysis of the length of time receivables have been past due 
based on this information  we reserve an amount that we believe to be doubtful of collection 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate or if economic conditions were to worsen  additional allowances might be required in the future 
underestimation of this allowance would cause accounts receivable to be overstated and current period expenses to be understated 
overestimation of this allowance would cause accounts receivable to be understated and current period expenses to be overstated 
valuation of deferred income taxes 
income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will not be realized  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the establishment  or increase  of a valuation allowance increases income tax expense for such year 
we have a valuation allowance against of our net deferred tax assets  which are composed primarily of net operating loss nol carryforwards 
even though we have fully reserved these net deferred tax assets for book purposes  we would still be able to utilize them to reduce future income taxes payable should we have future earnings 
to the extent such deferred tax assets relate to nol carryforwards  the ability to use such nols against future earnings will be subject to applicable carryforward periods 
as of march   we had nol carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of  and  respectively  which are available to offset taxable income through and  respectively

the following table presents consolidated net revenues by reportable business segment for the fiscal years ended march change change in thousands in thousands net revenues domestic     international     consolidated    fiscal compared to and domestic revenues 
during fiscal  our dvd and cd new release schedules did not perform as well as expected and were not as strong as fiscal and our catalogue revenues were also lower  most likely the result of the factors discussed below 
our top ten new release dvd and cd titles for fiscal  and together generated net revenues of million  million and million  respectively 
new releases totaled million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
we had a great deal of success during the fiscal holiday selling season third quarter  with such higher priced boxed sets as the bbc production of the chronicles of narnia containing the lion the witch and the wardrobe  the silver chair and prince caspian and the voyage of the dawn treader  the bill jeff larry and ron box set featuring bill engvall  jeff foxworthy  larry the cable guy and ron white and the twilight zone definitive edition seasons and we could not capitalize similarly on our fiscal holiday selling season third quarter due to a weaker performing release schedule 
the dvd marketplace for independent dvd suppliers such as us has been negatively impacted by a maturing and slowing dvd sell through market 
major motion picture studios are offering more of their catalogue programming to retail at reduced prices  taking up more precious shelf space from the independent suppliers 
the larger retailers use discounted dvds to drive consumer traffic to their stores which have weakened other stand alone dvd and cd retailers 
retail shelf space is at a premium and with the january and august bankruptcy filings of musicland and tower both significant customers of ours  the number of retail store fronts has decreased 
our customer trans world entertainment purchased approximately of the approximately musicland stores  closed approximately of those purchased and absorbed the inventories from all of the purchased stores  which included inventories originally purchased by musicland from us 
while our sales of product to trans world have increased for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  they have not covered the revenues lost as a result of musicland bankruptcy 
tower was purchased by a liquidator which liquidated the chain with going out of business sales 
tower s inventory  including inventories originally purchased by tower from us  was deeply discounted to consumers during our third quarter of fiscal as retail store fronts shrink and shelf space becomes more constrained  we are seeing sales to our internet retailers growing 
sales to amazon  infinity resources including critics choice video and deepdiscount 
com  and netflix have increased for fiscal  by  and  respectively  as compared to fiscal internet retailers offer virtual shelf space  which is of critical importance to an independent software supplier 
finally  we believe that the uncertainty of our future as an independent supplier of dvd programming has created retail buyer insecurity 
as a result  we believe retailers have decreased their inventories of our programming and reduced new purchases of our programming since lions gate launched their proxy contest 
in multiple face to face meetings with retail buyers  our sales force has been asked to comment on what s going on with lions gate and has also been asked in various ways whether or not we would continue operating distinctly as image entertainment in any post acquisition scenario 
retailers want assurances that they will be able to return unsold inventory  and we believe retail buyers do not like the uncertainty that accompanies the possibility of new ownership 
in the absence of such assurances  retail outlets have reacted to this insecurity by limiting their inventory and purchasing of our programming thus reducing their financial exposure until they are reassured as to our future 
image entertainment  inc we anticipate that the high definition dvd market will ultimately help energize overall dvd sales  as well as generate revenues for us from our high definition assets 
we have over high definition masters that can be released on either the hd dvd or blu ray disc formats  and through the conversion process we also have access to many more titles in our catalog 
digital distribution revenues 
egami offers near and medium term opportunities 
increasing broadband internet access and the consumer s growing expectation that they will be able to consume entertainment content exactly the way they want  where they want  and how they want  will play an extremely important role in how quickly digital distribution grows 
we believe the speed in which key industry players move to embrace the transition to digital distribution will most likely determine how quickly video on demand  digital download and streaming revenues grow 
our wholly owned subsidiary egami media is growing its revenues as the digital video market continues to develop 
our digital distribution revenues for fiscal grew to  from  in fiscal  egami s first full year of operations 
we anticipate continued growth of both our digital library and digital revenues 
international revenues 
our internationally generated revenues have significantly decreased over the last several years due to lower royalty revenues reported by our international sublicensees 
because of language barriers and cultural differences  much of our successful new release programming particularly urban and comedy titles has not been released internationally or has not sold as well as in north america 
we continue our efforts to acquire programming that sells well not only domestically  but also internationally 
music related dvds have done well internationally and we believe the urban music and documentary genres have revenue growth potential overseas 
broadcast sales were   and  for fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal benefited from higher revenues generated from hve  comedy and music event titles 
cost of sales the following table presents consolidated cost of sales by reportable business segment and as a percentage of related segment net revenues for the fiscal years ended march in thousands in thousands cost of sales domestic     international     consolidated     change change as a percentage of segment net revenues domestic international consolidated domestic gross profit margins 
gross margins for the domestic segment  as a percentage of segment net revenues  decreased to for fiscal  from for fiscal and for fiscal the million write down of assets related to our distribution agreement with source entertainment negatively impacted gross margins for the domestic segment  as a percentage of segment net revenues  by for fiscal see liquidity and capital resources source entertainment  inc chapter bankruptcy filing and related asset impairment above 
our gross margins are impacted by the sales mix of titles within the respective periods 
each of our exclusive agreements has differing terms 
we have exclusive license agreements and exclusive distribution agreements 
for license agreements  which typically generate higher gross margins  we pay a royalty based on sales  and for distribution agreements we generally retain a fee  recoup our costs and split back end profits  if any 
the average gross margin recognized is then reduced by expenses classified as cost of sales  such as the expenses generated by our distribution facility  amortization of non recoupable production costs  freight out and market development funds contributed to our retailers to get placement for our product 
when the average gross margin for a period is lower  these additional costs of sales items will further reduce the gross margins recognized 
image entertainment  inc other items affecting our average gross margins include the strength of a title s sales performance the selling price of a title the costs that we are responsible for  including disc manufacturing costs third party net profit participations  specifically the royalty rates  distribution fees retained and profit splits inherent in the agreements increased amortization of recoupable production costs and royalty advances as a result of reducing ultimate revenue projections for a title or a cross collateralized group of titles some specific factors contributing to the decrease in segment gross profit margins for fiscal  as compared to fiscal and fiscal were as a percentage of net revenues  we experienced a significant increase in net revenues generated by exclusively distributed content in fiscal versus exclusively licensed content  as compared to fiscal and historically  a higher percentage of revenues are generated from higher margin exclusively licensed titles 
because our revenues included such a high percentage of lower margin exclusively distributed programming  our average gross margins for all of our titles were lower  prior to the deduction of the other cost of sales items discussed above 
we experienced lower gross margins on some of our exclusively distributed dvd and cd product  attributable to higher amortization of recoupable production costs as a result of lowering ultimate revenue forecasts in light of recent  slowing dvd marketplace trends 
at lower revenue levels  fixed costs included in cost of sales represent a higher percentage of net revenues  negatively impacting our gross margin percentage 
we increased the amount of market development funds provided to our customers  which is recorded as a reduction of revenues and thus has a negative effect on gross margins 
these market development fund expenditures  as percentages of domestic net revenues  were  and  before reduction for such market development funds  for fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect the trend of increased market development funds paid to customers to continue for the foreseeable future 
international gross profit margins 
gross margins for the international segment are based upon royalty income generated by sales of our exclusive programming by our sublicensees 
the gross margins we report will fluctuate depending upon the sales mix of titles sold by our sublicensees and royalty rates to our content suppliers based upon those reported royalties 
we expect gross margins for this segment to continue to fluctuate higher and lower in future periods as a result of the factors mentioned above
