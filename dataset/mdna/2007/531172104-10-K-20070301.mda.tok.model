the company s operating results depend primarily upon income from rental operations and are substantially influenced by rental demand for the properties in operation 
rental demand for the properties in operation generally improved during the year ended december  although in some markets the company continues to experience market conditions characterized by an oversupply of leaseable space and soft demand  the company believes that the majority of its markets are recovering from a generally slow real estate economy

 business combinations  the company allocates the purchase price of real estate acquired to land  building and improvements and intangibles based on the relative fair value of each component 
the value ascribed to in place leases is based on the rental rates for the existing leases compared to the company s estimate of the fair market lease rates for leases of similar terms and present valuing the difference based on an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired 
origination values are also assigned to in place leases  and  where appropriate  value is assigned to customer relationships 
origination cost estimates include the costs to execute leases with terms similar to the remaining lease terms of the in place leases  including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses

calculation of funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit has issued a standard definition for funds from operations as defined below 
the sec has agreed to the disclosure of this non gaap financial measure on a per share basis in its release no 
 conditions for use of non gaap financial measures 
the company believes that the calculation of funds from operations is helpful to investors and management as it is a measure of the company s operating performance that excludes depreciation and amortization and gains and losses from property dispositions 
as a result  year over year comparison of funds from operations reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs  development activities  general and administrative expenses  and interest costs  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
in addition  management believes that funds from operations provides useful information to the investment community about the company s financial performance when compared to other reits since funds from operations is generally recognized as the standard for reporting the operating performance of a reit 
funds from operations available to common shareholders is defined by nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
funds from operations available to common shareholders does not represent net income or cash flows from operations as defined by gaap and does not necessarily indicate that cash flows will be sufficient to fund cash needs 
it should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
funds from operations available to common shareholders also does not represent cash flows generated from operating  investing or financing activities as defined by gaap

the million credit facility and the financing related to the comcast center  see note to the company s financial statements bear interest at variable rates  therefore  the amount of interest payable under the million credit facility and the financing related to the comcast center is influenced by changes in short term interest rates  which tend to be sensitive to inflation 
to the extent an increase in inflation would result in increased operating costs  such as in insurance  real estate taxes and utilities  substantially all of the tenants leases require the tenants to absorb these costs as part of their rental obligations 
in addition  inflation also may have the effect of increasing market rental rates 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about the company s risk management includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
the company s primary market risk exposure is to changes in interest rates 
the company is exposed to market risk related to its million credit facility and certain other indebtedness as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the interest on the million credit facility and certain other indebtedness is subject to fluctuations in the market 
the company also uses long term and medium term debt as a source of capital 
these debt instruments are typically issued at fixed interest rates 
when these debt instruments mature  the company typically refinances such debt at then existing market interest rates which may be more or less than the interest rates on the maturing debt 
in addition  the company may attempt to reduce interest rate risk associated with a forecasted issuance of new debt 
in order to reduce interest rate risk associated with these transactions  the company occasionally enters into interest rate protection agreements 
if the interest rates for variable rate debt were basis points higher or lower during  the company s interest expense would have increased or decreased by million 
if the interest rate for the fixed rate debt maturing in was basis points higher or lower than its current rate of  the company s interest expense would have increased or decreased by  the sensitivity analysis above assumes no changes in the company s financial structure 
it also does not consider future fluctuations in interest rates or the specific actions that might be taken by management to mitigate the impact of such fluctuations 
the company is also exposed to currency risk on its net investment in the united kingdom 
the company does not believe that this currency risk exposure is material to its financial statements
