item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for an understanding of avnet and the significant factors that influenced the company s performance during the past three fiscal years  the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the description of the business appearing in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements  including the related notes  and other information appearing in item of this report 
the company operates on a week fiscal year 
the fiscal years ended june   july  and july  all contained weeks 
there are numerous references to the impact of foreign currency translation in the discussion of the company s results of operations that follow 
over the past several years  the exchange rates between the us dollar and many foreign currencies  especially the euro  have fluctuated significantly 
for example  the us dollar has weakened against the euro by approximately when comparing fiscal to fiscal  but strengthened against the euro by approximately from fiscal to fiscal when the weaker us dollar exchange rates of the current year 
table of contents are used to translate the results of operations of avnet s subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies  the resulting impact is an increase  in us dollars  of reported results 
when the stronger us dollar exchange rates are used to translate the results  the resulting impact is a decrease  in us dollars  of reported results 
in the discussion that follows  this is referred to as the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
when this translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates is excluded from the reported results on a pro forma basis  it is referred to as constant dollars 
results as reported in the financial statements which include this translation impact are referred to as delivered dollars or reported dollars 
in addition to disclosing financial results that are determined in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the company also discloses certain non gaap financial information such as income or expense items as adjusted for the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  as discussed above  or adjusted for the impact of acquisitions by adjusting avnet s prior periods to include the sales of businesses acquired prior to the date of acquisition and divestitures by adjusting avnet s prior periods to exclude the sales of businesses divested 
management believes that providing this additional information is useful to the reader to better assess and understand operating performance  especially when comparing results with previous periods or forecasting performance for future periods  primarily because management typically monitors the business both including and excluding these adjustments to gaap results 
management also uses these non gaap measures to establish operational goals and  in some cases  for measuring performance for compensation purposes 
however  analysis of results and outlook on a non gaap basis should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  data presented in accordance with gaap 
results of operations executive summary several items impacted the financial results for avnet as a whole when comparing fiscal results with fiscal the acquisitions of access distribution access and azure technology azure both discussed further below  which occurred in the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  respectively  positively impacts the comparison of results to prior period results of avnet and ts as prior periods do not include the acquired business results before the date of acquisition 
also  in conjunction with the acquisition of access and reflecting recent industry trends  the company reviewed its method of recording revenue related to the sales of supplier service contracts and determined that such sales will now be classified on a net revenue basis rather than on a gross basis beginning the third quarter of fiscal referred to as the change to net revenue reporting in this md a 
although this change reduces sales and cost of sales for the technology solutions operating group and on a consolidated basis  it has no impact on operating income  net income  cash flow or the balance sheet 
the company divested of several small non core businesses during fiscal affecting both em and ts which also negatively impacts fiscal sales comparisons with fiscal as the prior periods include the sales of the divested businesses 
these items  when aggregated  have a net positive impact on fiscal sales comparisons to prior periods and are presented in tables under sales 
as mentioned above  on december   avnet completed the acquisition of access distribution  a leading value added distributor of complex computing solutions which recorded sales of billion in calendar year the purchase price of approximately million  subject to adjustment based upon the audited closing net book value  was funded primarily with debt plus cash on hand 
the integration of the access business into the ts americas and emea operations was complete as of the end of fiscal and  as a result  the company estimates it achieved more than million of annualized synergies  the benefit of which will largely impact fiscal in addition  during fourth quarter of fiscal  the company acquired azure  an it solutions provider in asia that specializes in systems infrastructure and application solutions services with annualized sales of approximately million 
avnet s consolidated sales for fiscal were a record billion  up billion or  over fiscal of billion  with approximately million of the increase resulting from the translation impact of foreign currency exchange rates 
the ts operating group was the driver of the year over year growth primarily as a result of the access and azure acquisitions  which contributed over million in sales since they were acquired 
ts sales were up year over year and em sales were up 
as presented in the tables under sales  
table of contents consolidated sales were impacted by the access and azure acquisitions  the businesses divested in fiscal and the change to net revenue reporting 
avnet s ongoing focus on the management of operating costs and returns on capital has resulted in its highest level of operating income  operating income margin and returns on capital since before the multi year economic and industry downturn that began in on a consolidated basis  operating income grew to a record million as compared with fiscal operating income of million 
operating profit margin also increased year over year to  up basis points from in the prior fiscal year 
both operating groups contributed to the year over year increase in operating profit margin  with em and ts reporting operating profit margins of an increase of basis points and an increase of basis points  respectively  for fiscal for em  the fourth quarter of fiscal marks the sixth quarter in a row that operating income margin is over 
for ts  the fourth quarter of fiscal marks the sixteenth consecutive quarter of year over year improvement in both operating income dollars and margin 
the consolidated current and prior year results included certain restructuring  integration and other items discussed further in this md a  which amounted to million for fiscal and million million of which was included in cost of sales for the prior year 
despite these charges  the year over year operating income improved primarily as a result of continued focus on profitable growth  cost efficiencies and the effect of the realization of a full year of synergies after the successful integration of the memec acquisition 
operating efficiency and working capital management will remain a key focus of avnet s overall value based management initiatives to increase return on capital and its efforts to continue to grow profitability at a faster rate than its growth in revenues 
it is difficult for the company  as a distributor  to forecast the material trends of the electronic component and computer products industry  aside from some of the normal seasonality discussed herein  because avnet does not typically have material forward looking information available from its customers and suppliers beyond a few months of forecast information by way of incoming order rates 
as such  management relies on the publicly available information published by certain industry groups and other related analyses in evaluating its business plans in the longer term 
sales the table below provides a year over year summary of sales for the company and its operating groups three year analysis of sales by operating group and geography years ended percent change june  of july  of july  of to to total total total dollars in millions sales by operating group em ts sales by geographic area americas emea asia pacific 
table of contents items impacting fiscal sales as discussed in executive summary  sales for fiscal as compared with fiscal were impacted by the aggregate of i the sales of access and azure since the close of the acquisitions  ii sales of the divested em and ts businesses included in prior periods  and iii the change in classification of sales of supplier service contracts to a net revenue basis 
comparative financial information is presented for acquisitions  divestitures and other items in order to better assess and understand the company s revenue performance 
the following tables present the sales of acquisitions prior to their date of close  revenue from divestitures prior to their date of sale and the effect of the change to net revenue reporting for periods prior to the implementation thereof for each quarter of fiscal and gross to net acquisition sales divested sales revenue impact total impact thousands q fiscal q fiscal q fiscal q fiscal total divested sales gross to net acquisition sales em ts revenue impact total impact thousands q fiscal q fiscal q fiscal q fiscal total avnet s consolidated sales in fiscal were a record billion  up billion  or  over fiscal consolidated sales of billion 
the year over year growth occurred in all three geographic regions and in both operating groups 
of the billion year over year increase  approximately million is a result of the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
more than half of the reported sales growth is attributable to the access and azure acquisitions 
as presented in the tables above  the comparison of sales to prior year were also impacted by current year acquisitions  prior year divestitures and the change to net revenue reporting 
when the impacts of these items are considered in both the current and prior fiscal year  consolidated sales growth would have been 
both em and ts contributed to the year over year improvement in sales 
specifically  fiscal sales for em were billion  up million  or over fiscal fiscal sales for ts were billion  up billion  or  as compared with sales of billion for fiscal including access and azure in the periods prior to the acquisition dates and including the change to net revenue reporting for periods prior to third quarter of fiscal  ts year over year sales growth would have been 
em sales of billion were up over fiscal excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates which management estimates increased current year sales by approximately million and the impact of divestitures which had sales of approximately million in fiscal  em sales grew year over year 
although the rate of em sales growth slowed to the low single digits at the end of fiscal  continued focus on operating efficiencies and profitable revenue enabled em to grow operating income more than five times faster than sales 
geographically  sales in the em americas were billion  a decline of from fiscal sales of billion 
the fiscal sales in the em americas region were significantly impacted by a slow down in purchases from large ems customers primarily due to softer demand in the communications infrastructure end markets 
sales in the em emea region increased to billion in fiscal and increased excluding the impact of divestitures and the changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the comparative results for the em emea were positively impacted by the changes in foreign currency 
table of contents exchange rates  as discussed above  but were negatively impacted as prior year sales for the em emea region included revenues of approximately million of two small specialty businesses that were divested in the fourth quarter of fiscal em asia sales were billion  up over fiscal sales of billion as asia continues to experience the highest growth rate among the three regions 
ts reported sales of billion for fiscal  up billion  or  when compared with fiscal sales of billion 
approximately million of the growth is due to the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
more than half of the year over year growth was due to the acquisition of access 
conversely  the comparative year over year growth for ts was negatively impacted by the change to net revenue reporting for supplier service contracts and by the divestiture of its enterprise solutions business during the third quarter of fiscal  which generated sales of approximately million in fiscal excluding the effect of current year acquisitions  prior year divestitures and the change to net revenue reporting as presented in the preceding table  ts sales growth would have been which was impacted by weakness in microprocessor sales 
on a regional basis  all three regions experienced sales growth with the americas contributing the majority of the increase which grew million  or  year over year 
the emea region reported sales growth of  or excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates of approximately million  the change to net revenue reporting and the impact of the access acquisition 
the asia region  which was not impacted by the access acquisition  grew sales  with more than half of the growth due to the positive impact of the azure acquisition 
for the americas and emea regions  comparisons to prior year were positively impacted by the access acquisition and negatively impacted by the change to net revenue reporting and the business divested in fiscal in the americas 
avnet s consolidated sales in fiscal were billion  up billion  or  over fiscal consolidated sales of billion 
year over year growth was driven primarily by the acquisition of memec 
including memec s sales in fiscal on a pro forma basis  avnet s consolidated sales grew on a delivered us dollar basis and an estimated excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
em recorded sales of billion in fiscal  up billion  or  over em s fiscal sales of billion 
including memec s sales in fiscal on a pro forma basis  em s fiscal sales grew as compared with the prior year in delivered us dollars and by approximately excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which management estimates reduced em s year over year sales growth by approximately million 
ts sales in fiscal were a record billion  up million  or  over fiscal sales of billion 
excluding the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  ts fiscal sales grew approximately over the prior year 
gross profit and gross profit margins consolidated gross profit was billion in fiscal  up million  or  as compared with fiscal the gross profit in fiscal included a charge totaling million to write down inventory due primarily to supplier terminations in connection with the memec acquisition in fiscal see restructuring  integration and other items for further discussion 
gross profit margin of was up basis points as compared with fiscal profit margin of 
both operating groups contributed to the improvement in gross profit margins with an increase of basis points at em and basis points at ts 
the impact to gross margins resulted from the change in the mix of business between em and ts over the prior year as a result of the access acquisition as well as the change from gross revenue to net revenue reporting for supplier service contracts 
for em  the mix of revenues among small to medium businesses and large customers  particularly large ems customers discussed previously  positively impacted em s gross profit margins 
with the addition of access sales in fiscal  ts sales grew to of consolidated sales compared to of consolidated sales in fiscal which impacted consolidated gross margins 
the ts business is typically a higher asset velocity business than em  but is also a lower gross profit margin business compared with em 
consolidated gross profit in fiscal was billion as compared with billion in fiscal gross profit margin in fiscal was  down from in fiscal the increase in gross profit dollars was due primarily to the increase in sales as a result of the acquisition of memec 
as mentioned above  the gross profit in fiscal included charges totaling million to write down certain inventory due primarily to supplier 
table of contents terminations 
in fiscal  the company s gross margin was impacted by the mix of business between avnet s two operating groups and mix of sales by region 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in fiscal were billion  an increase of million  or  as compared with fiscal excluding the translation impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  sg a expenses were down 
the year over year comparison of expenses was positively impacted by the divestitures of businesses in the second half of fiscal  further cost reduction initiatives during fiscal see restructuring  integration and other items for further discussion and the synergy benefits associated with the memec integration during fiscal during fiscal  the company was in the process of integrating the memec business into the existing operations of avnet  with that integration completed by the end of fiscal as a result  fiscal operating expenses reflect the full benefit of the synergies achieved  whereas fiscal results reflect only a portion of the synergies as the integration was not completed until the end of fiscal in addition  during the second half of fiscal  the access acquisition was being integrated into avnet s business which was completed as of the end of fiscal management estimates that as of the end of fiscal it has achieved over million of annualized operating expense synergies as a result of the completed integration  which are expected to be fully realized beginning fiscal two additional metrics which management monitors are sg a expenses as a percentage of sales and as a percentage of gross profit 
sg a as a percentage of sales was in fiscal  down basis points  as compared with in fiscal sg a as a percentage of gross profit was in fiscal  down basis points  as compared with in fiscal  however  this metric for fiscal was negatively impacted by the million line termination charge in prior year see restructuring  integration and other items for further discussion 
the year over year improvement in both of these metrics is primarily due to the company s realization of operating expense synergies following the acquisition and integration of memec 
the metrics were also positively impacted by the company s ongoing focus on managing levels of operating costs through its various operational excellence initiatives 
consolidated sg a expenses were billion  or of sales  in fiscal as compared with billion  or of sales  in fiscal the increase in sg a dollars over the prior year is a direct result of the expansion of the overall business following the acquisition of memec at the beginning of fiscal despite this increase in sg a expenses  the ratio of sg a expenses as a percentage of sales improved basis points over fiscal the primary driver in the ratio improvement was the realization of synergies as a result of restructuring and integration actions taken in fiscal as of the end of fiscal  the company had taken actions to remove approximately million of annualized operating expenses from the combined avnet and memec businesses 
sg a expenses as compared to fiscal were also negatively impacted by incremental stock based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of a new accounting pronouncement and the initial recognition and subsequent amortization of intangible assets associated with the memec acquisition 
restructuring  integration and other items the company recorded a number of restructuring  integration and other items during fiscal and there were no restructuring charges recorded in fiscal the fiscal restructuring  integration and other items related primarily to cost reduction initiatives and the acquisition and subsequent integration of access

operating income operating income for fiscal was million  or of consolidated sales  as compared with operating income of million  or of consolidated sales  in fiscal the gross margin and operating expense trends discussed previously in this md a contributed to the basis point improvement in operating income margin year over year 
the operating income margin in fiscal benefited by basis points as a result of the change to net revenue reporting for supplier service contracts and was negatively impacted by basis points from the restructuring  integration and other items in connection with the cost reduction initiatives and the access integration activity as well as other items previously discussed  which amounted to million pre tax 
in comparison  operating income for fiscal was negatively impacted by a total of million of 
table of contents consolidated sales for restructuring charges previously described 
see restructuring  integration and other items for further discussion 
the overall improvement in operating income margin without these charges was driven by the increased sales volume  gross profit margin growth  continued focus on cost management and the full benefit of the synergies achieved subsequent to the successful memec integration completed at the end of fiscal  as discussed previously in this md a 
em reported operating income of million of em sales in fiscal as compared with operating income of million of em sales in fiscal the fourth quarter of fiscal is the sixth consecutive quarter that em has generated operating income margin in excess of

in addition  during fiscal  the company recorded a benefit in other income due to the recovery of a non trade receivable during the first quarter  however  this benefit was offset by equity method investment losses 
fiscal results included higher rate interest income earned on cash balances partially offset by foreign currency losses 
the interest income in fiscal also included approximately million earned on the investment of the net proceeds from the issuance of the notes during the four week tender period for the notes discussed above 
fiscal contained foreign currency losses which offset a portion of the interest income earned on the company s cash and cash equivalent balances 
gain loss on sale of business lines during fiscal  the company recorded a gain related to the receipt of contingent purchase price proceeds from the fiscal sale of a ts end user business discussed below 
the gain amounted to million pre tax  million after tax and per share on a diluted basis 
during fiscal  the company divested two ts end user business lines in the americas and two em specialty business lines in emea 
in ts  the company sold its americas end user server and storage business line to a value added reseller

the increase in the effective rate in fiscal compared with fiscal was primarily due to the negative tax impact of the em divestiture as discussed above and additional contingency reserves due to the recognition of tax exposures in the emea and asia regions  partially offset by a favorable settlement of a european audit 
excluding these items  the effective tax rate would have been lower than the us federal tax rate for fiscal as a result of varying statutory tax rates across the jurisdictions in which the company operates

year ended july  gross operating pre tax net diluted profit income income income eps in thousands  except per share data restructuring  integration and other items loss on sale of business lines  net debt extinguishment costs total critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon the company s continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgments and estimates 
management believes the company s most critical accounting policies relate to valuation of receivables the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from customer defaults 
bad debt reserves are recorded based upon historic default averages as well as the company s regular assessment of the financial condition of its customers 
therefore  if collection experience or the financial condition of specific customers were to deteriorate  management would evaluate whether additional allowances and corresponding charges to the consolidated statement of operations are required 
valuation of inventories inventories are recorded at the lower of cost first in first out or estimated market value 
the company s inventories include high technology components  embedded systems and computing technologies sold into rapidly changing  cyclical and competitive markets whereby such inventories may be subject to early technological obsolescence 

table of contents the company regularly evaluates inventories for excess  obsolescence or other factors that may render inventories less marketable 
write downs are recorded so that inventories reflect the approximate net realizable value and take into account the company s contractual provisions with its suppliers  which may provide certain protections to the company for product obsolescence and price erosion in the form of rights of return and price protection 
because of the large number of transactions and the complexity of managing the process around price protections and stock rotations  estimates are made regarding adjustments to the carrying amount of inventories 
additionally  assumptions about future demand  market conditions and decisions to discontinue certain product lines can impact the decision to write down inventories 
if assumptions about future demand change or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  management would evaluate whether additional write downs of inventories are required 
in any case  actual values could be different from those estimated 
accounting for income taxes management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities and the valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
the carrying value of the company s net operating loss carry forwards is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
in addition  the company considers historic levels of income  expectations and risk associated with estimates of future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing a tax valuation allowance 
should the company determine that it is not able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an additional valuation allowance may be recorded against the deferred tax assets with a corresponding charge to income in the period such determination is made 
the company establishes reserves for potentially unfavorable outcomes of positions taken on certain tax matters 
these reserves are based on management s judgments and estimates of probable future tax liabilities 
as these estimates are highly judgmental  there may be differences between the anticipated and actual outcomes of these matters that may result in reversals of reserves or additional tax liabilities in excess of the reserved amounts 
to the extent such adjustments are warranted  the company s effective tax rate may potentially fluctuate as a result 
restructuring  integration and impairment charges the company has been subject to the financial impact of integrating acquired businesses and charges related to business reorganizations 
in connection with such events  management is required to make estimates about the financial impact of such matters that are inherently uncertain 
accrued liabilities and reserves are established to cover the cost of severance  facility consolidation and closure  lease termination fees  inventory adjustments based upon acquisition related termination of supplier agreements and or the re evaluation of the acquired working capital assets inventory and accounts receivable  and write down of other acquired assets including goodwill 
actual amounts incurred could be different from those estimated 
additionally  in assessing the company s goodwill for impairment in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to make significant assumptions about the future cash flows and overall performance of its reporting units 
should these assumptions or the structure of the reporting units change in the future based upon market conditions or changes in business strategy  the company may be required to record impairment charges to goodwill 
contingencies and litigation the company is involved in various legal proceedings and other claims related to environmental  labor  product and other matters  all of which arise in the normal course of business 
the company is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgment or outcome to these matters  as well as the range of potential losses 
a determination of the reserves required  if any  is made after careful analysis by management and internal and  when necessary  external counsel 
the required reserves may change in the future due to developments or a change in circumstances 
changes to reserves could increase or decrease earnings in the period the changes are effective 

table of contents the company does not consider revenue recognition to be a critical accounting policy due to the nature of its business in which revenues are generally recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
generally  these criteria are met upon the actual shipment of product to the customer 
accordingly  other than for estimates related to possible returns of products from customers  discounts or rebates  the recording of revenue does not require significant judgments or estimates 
provisions for returns are estimated based on historical sales returns  credit memo analysis and other known factors 
provisions are made for discounts and rebates  which are primarily volume based  and are generally based on historical trends and anticipated customer buying patterns 
finally  revenues from maintenance contracts  which are deferred and recognized in income over the life of the agreement  are not material to the consolidated results of operations of the company

liquidity and capital resources cash flows the following table summarizes the company s cash flow activities for fiscal  and  including the company s computation of free cash flow and a reconciliation of this metric to the nearest gaap measures of net income and net cash flow from operations 
management s computation of free cash flow consists of net cash flow from operations plus cash flows generated from or used for purchases and sales of property  plant and equipment  acquisitions and divestitures of operations  effects of exchange rates on cash and cash equivalents and other financing activities 
management believes that the non gaap metric of free cash flow is a useful measure to help management and investors better assess and understand the company s operating performance and sources and uses of cash 
management also believes the analysis of free cash flow assists in identifying underlying trends in the business 
computations of free cash flow may differ from company to company 
therefore  the analysis of free cash flow should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  the company s consolidated statements of cash flows presented in the accompanying financial statements appearing in item of this report 
management also analyzes cash flow from operations based upon its three primary components noted in the table below net income  non cash and other reconciling items and cash flow generated from or used for working capital

the working capital inflow in fiscal consisted of an increase in receivables million  decrease in inventories million  increase in accounts payable million and cash outflow for other items million 
the growth in receivables as well as payables was primarily attributable to ts and was driven  in part  by the acquisition of the access business for which the largest supplier is sun microsystems whose strongest quarter is typically its june fiscal year end 
the decrease in inventory was a net result of em s decrease of million partially offset by a small increase in inventory at ts 
in addition  during fiscal  the company paid million associated with the restructuring  integration and other charges and exit related costs accrued through purchase accounting 
see results of operations restructuring  integration and other items discussed elsewhere in this md a

avnet generated million of net cash flows from operations during fiscal this positive cash flow was largely driven by the company s improved profitability in fiscal  as further discussed in results of operations in this md a  and the generation of cash from its working capital  excluding cash and cash equivalents 
management has continued to focus on improving asset utilization and efficiency since the economic and industry downturn that began in fiscal this focus was enhanced again in fiscal as the company weathered the mid cycle inventory correction in the electronic components sector 
the company s efforts to manage the combined balance of accounts receivable and inventories  net of accounts payable  allowed the company to generate positive cash flows from these working capital components of million in fiscal a significant catalyst for this cash flow was the company s ability to effectively manage inventory levels throughout its business 
cash expenditures for acquisitions of operations relate to the first quarter fiscal acquisition of dns slovakia  a small computer product distributor  as well as certain legal and other costs incurred in fiscal related to the acquisition of memec  which did not close until after fiscal trends in foreign currency exchange rates shifted in fiscal to generate a net cash outflow as most foreign currencies  particularly the euro  weakened slightly against the us dollar in the second half of fiscal this negative cash flow results from the translation of avnet s cash and cash equivalents held in foreign currencies  which were generally higher throughout the second half of fiscal resulting largely from the combination of the company s higher profitability and working capital management as it emerged from the mid cycle inventory correction 
the combination of these factors yielded net free cash flow in fiscal of million  of which the company utilized million for repayment of debt

the company has no other significant financial commitments outside of normal debt and lease maturities discussed in capital structure and contractual obligations 
management believes that avnet s borrowing capacity  its current cash availability and the company s expected ability to generate operating cash flows are sufficient to meet its projected financing needs 
generally  the company is more likely to utilize operating cash flows for working capital requirements in a growing electronic component and computer products industry
