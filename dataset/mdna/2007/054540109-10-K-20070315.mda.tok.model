overview axcelis technologies  inc axcelis  we  us  or our  is a worldwide producer of ion implantation  dry strip  thermal processing and curing equipment used in the fabrication of semiconductors 
in addition  we provide extensive aftermarket service and support  including spare parts  equipment upgrades  and maintenance services 
we own of the equity of a joint venture known as sen corporation  an shi and axcelis company  or sen with sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
in japan 
sen licenses technology from us relating to the manufacture of specified ion implantation products and has exclusive rights to manufacture and sell these products in the territory of japan 
sen is the leading producer of ion implantation equipment in japan 
the semiconductor capital equipment industry has in the past been subject to significant cyclical swings in capital spending by semiconductor manufacturers 
capital spending is influenced by demand for semiconductors and the products using them  the utilization rate and capacity of existing semiconductor manufacturing facilities and changes in semiconductor technology  all of which are outside of our control 
as a result  our revenues and gross margins  to the extent affected by increases or decreases in volume  could fluctuate from year to year and period to period 
our gross margins are also affected by the introduction of new products 
we typically become more efficient in manufacturing products as they mature 
for example  our gross margins in  and were adversely affected in part as a result of the increased proportion of relatively new systems sold to process mm wafers 
we expect gross margins to continue to be under substantial pressure in due to sales of our new single wafer implant products 
our expense base is largely fixed and does not vary significantly with changes in volume 
therefore  we could experience fluctuations in operating results and cash flows depending on our revenues as driven by the level of capital expenditures by semiconductor manufacturers 
the sizable expense of building  upgrading or expanding a semiconductor fabrication facility is increasingly causing semiconductor companies to contract with foundries to manufacture their semiconductors 
in addition  consolidation and partnering within the semiconductor manufacturing industry is increasing 
we expect these trends to continue to reduce the number of our potential customers 
this growing concentration of axcelis customers may increase competitive pricing as higher percentages of our total revenues are tied to the buying decisions of a particular customer or a small number of customers 
the years and were transition years in implant products and technology 
while customers continue to buy multi wafer tools  many customers have shifted primarily to single wafer tools for high current applications 
because we did not have a single wafer high current product we experienced a significant loss of market share in we introduced our single wafer optima md product in and our single wafer optima hd product in throughout and  we began shipping these products for medium and high current applications 
our single wafer tool for high energy applications is scheduled to be released in the second half of these new single wafer products are expected to enable us to regain market share in and future years 
axcelis accesses the important japanese market for certain ion implant systems through a joint venture known as sen with sumitomo heavy industries  ltd 
that we do not control 
the joint venture agreement gives both owners veto rights  so that neither owner alone can effectively control sen 
sen s business is subject to the same risks as our business 
royalties and equity income from sen have made a substantial contribution to our earnings  and a substantial decline in sen s sales and net income could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
as a result of this joint venture structure  we have less control over sen management than over our own management and may not have timely knowledge of factors affecting sen s business 
in addition  given the equal ownership  it is possible that the sen board may be unable to reach consensus on important matters from time to time which could delay important decisions or create a deadlock  which could lead to the liquidation of sen 
see item business sen corporation  an shi and axcelis company 
in addition  sen and axcelis are engaged in an arbitration initiated by axcelis to establish a basis for setting the royalty for a single wafer  high current ion implant system known as the shx 
see item business sen corporation  an shi and axcelis company 
in response to axcelis arbitration claim  sen has filed counter claims which axcelis believes have no merit 
in december  sen and axcelis jointly appointed a sole arbitrator 
the schedule for this arbitration is not yet fixed 
we believe that this proceeding will lead to a mutually acceptable royalty bearing license in favor of axcelis at a rate similar to that paid by sen under the existing license agreement 
to date  the amount of royalty due to axcelis for sales of the shx  computed at such a rate  is not material and  given royalty rates on other sen products  is not expected to have a material impact on axcelis results of operations in future periods 
operating results for the future years presented are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for other interim periods or for the year as a whole 
critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon axcelis consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  income taxes  accounts receivable  inventory and warranty obligations 
management s estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies are critical in the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition axcelis revenue recognition policy involves significant judgment by management 
as described in detail below  we consider a broad array of facts and circumstances in determining when to recognize revenue  including contractual obligations to the customer  the complexity of the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions  payment history  customer creditworthiness and the installation process 
in the future  if the post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process become more complex or result in a materially lower rate of acceptance  we may have to revise our revenue recognition policy  which could delay the timing of revenue recognition 
axcelis revenue transactions include sales of products under multiple element arrangements 
revenue under these arrangements is allocated to each element  except systems  based upon its estimated fair market value 
the amount of revenue allocated to systems is calculated on a residual method 
under this method  the total value of the arrangement is allocated first to the undelivered elements  with the residual amount being allocated to systems revenue 
the value of the undelivered elements includes a the greater of i the fair value of the installation or ii the portion of the sales price that will not be received until the installation is completed the retention plus b the fair value of all other undelivered elements 
the amount allocated to installation is based upon the fair value of the service performed  including labor  which is based upon the estimated time to complete the installation at hourly rates  and material components 
the fair value of all other undelivered elements is based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
system revenue is generally recognized upon shipment provided title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  evidence of an arrangement exists  prices are contractually fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured through historical collection results and regular credit evaluations  and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance 
revenue from installation services is recognized at the time formal acceptance is received from the customer or  for certain customers  when both the formal acceptance and retention payment have been received 
revenue for other elements is recognized at the time products are shipped or the related services are performed 
management continues to believe recognition of systems revenue at the time of shipment is appropriate because the customer s post delivery acceptance provisions and installation process have been established to be routine  commercially inconsequential and perfunctory 
the majority of axcelis systems are designed and tailored to meet the customer s specifications  as outlined in the contract between the customer and axcelis  which may be the axcelis standard specification 
to ensure that the customer s specifications are satisfied  many customers request that newer systems be tested at axcelis facilities prior to shipment  normally with the customer present  under conditions that substantially replicate the customer s production environment and the customer s criteria are confirmed to have been met 
customers of mature products generally do not require pre shipment testing 
we believe the risk of failure to complete a system installation is remote 
should an installation not be completed successfully  the contractual provisions do not provide for forfeiture  refund or other purchase price concession beyond those prescribed by the provisions of the uniform commercial code applicable generally to such transactions 
in the small number of instances where axcelis is unsure of meeting the customer s specifications or obtaining customer acceptance upon shipment of the system or for initial shipments of systems with new technologies  axcelis will defer the recognition of systems revenue and related costs until written customer acceptance of the system is obtained 
this deferral period is generally within twelve months of shipment 
services revenue includes revenue from spare parts  equipment upgrades and maintenance services 
revenue related to maintenance and service contracts is recognized ratably over the duration of the contracts  or based on parts usage  where appropriate 
revenue related to time and material services is recognized when the services are performed 
revenue related to spare parts sales and equipment upgrades is recognized upon the later of shipment or when the title and risk of loss passes to the customer 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations 
goodwill represents the excess of cost over net assets  including all identifiable intangible assets  of acquired businesses 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized 
other intangible assets that are separable from goodwill and have determinable useful lives are valued separately and amortized over their useful lives 
such other identifiable intangible assets consist mainly of developed technology and are generally amortized over periods ranging from five to ten years 
we perform an annual impairment review of goodwill 
impairment reviews may be performed more frequently if there are other indicators of impairment 
the annual impairment test consists of determining the fair market value of the business unit through a discounted cash flow analysis 
management s best judgments are employed in determining future market conditions that impact this discounted cash flow analysis 
as a result of our annual review conducted as of december   we determined that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
if we determine through the impairment review process that goodwill has been impaired  we would record the impairment charge in our statement of operations as a non cash charge to earnings 
we assess the impairment of intangible assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review include the following a significant underperformance relative to expected operating results  a significant change in the manner of our use of the acquired asset or the strategy for our overall business  a significant negative industry or economic trend  and a significant decrease in our market capitalization relative to net book value 
as part of this assessment  we review the expected future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts axcelis records an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of axcelis customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be necessary 
inventory allowance for excess and obsolescence axcelis records an allowance for estimated excess and obsolete inventory 
the allowance is determined using management s assumptions of materials usage  based on estimates of forecasted and historical demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
product warranty axcelis offers a one to three year product warranty  the terms and conditions of which vary depending upon the product sold 
for all systems sold  we accrue a liability for the estimated cost of standard warranty at the time of system shipment and defer the portion of systems revenue attributable to the fair value of non standard warranty 
costs for non standard warranty are expensed as incurred 
factors that affect our warranty liability include the number of installed units  historical and anticipated product failure rates  material usage and service labor costs 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our recorded liability and adjust the amount as necessary 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  revenue systems services royalties  primarily from sen cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative amortization of intangible assets restructuring charges income loss from operations other income expense equity income of sen interest income interest expense other net income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue systems revenue was million  or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue  in the increase in sales of systems compared with was primarily attributable to stronger market demand resulting from higher levels of chip production by our semiconductor manufacturing customers 
while overall systems revenue increased in  the shift by semiconductor manufacturers from our multi wafer high current ion implant systems to single wafer high current ion implant systems had an adverse  though not quantifiable  impact on systems revenue 
the high current segment constitutes approximately fifty percent of the worldwide ion implant market 
our first shipment of our new single wafer high dose ion implant system occurred in we began shipping our new mid dose single wafer ion implant system in  and recognized revenue on multiple shipments during the year 
approximately of systems revenue in was from sales of mm products and was from sales of mm products  compared with and for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
market trends for the past several years highlight the growth in sales toward mm products and the decrease in expansion of facilities using mm products 
revenue from sales of ion implantation products and services accounted for million or of total revenue in  compared with million  or  of total revenue in ion implantation continues to be our largest product category 
as described above in revenue recognition  a portion of our systems revenue is deferred until installation and other services related to future deliverables are performed

services revenue  which includes spare parts  equipment upgrades  and maintenance services  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for services revenue fluctuates with capacity utilization by our customers  and the increase in services revenue for is attributable to a continually expanding installed base of our products and increasing utilization by semiconductor manufacturers 
royalty revenue was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for royalties are primarily earned under the terms of our license agreement with sen 
revenue changes are mainly attributed to fluctuations in sen sales volume based on demand for equipment by japanese semiconductor manufacturers and the timing of shipments in japan

research and development research and development expense was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with million in the increase was driven primarily by expenses associated with an increase of project driven headcount million  variable compensation payouts million and stock option expense million 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower costs associated with project material million  development asset amortization and depreciation million and in process research and development expense in related to the diamond semiconductor group acquisition million 
increases in overall research and development expenses in compared with are attributable principally to development efforts related to our single wafer optima platform 
research and development expense involved the following activities in  for new product development  for improvement of existing products  and for product testing 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expense was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with million in this increase was driven primarily by higher commission million and variable compensation million expenses 
these cost increases were partially offset by lower payroll million and amortization depreciation 
million expenses 
general and administrative general and administrative expense was million in  an increase of million  or  as compared with million in this increase was driven primarily by higher costs associated with variable compensation million and stock compensation million offset by reduced costs associated with the consolidation of our rockville  maryland operations into our headquarters and manufacturing facility located in beverly  massachusetts million and lower lease  travel  utilities  sales tax and insurance expense million 
stock based compensation expense during the first quarter of fiscal  we adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  or sfas r  using the modified prospective application method 
the effect of adopting sfas r was to reduce net income for the year ended december  by million on basic and diluted earnings per share 
total stock based compensation expense related to stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and the employee stock purchase plan for the year ended december  was million 
stock based compensation expense recognized for restricted stock and restricted stock units for the year ended december  was million 
see note to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding our adoption of sfas r 
restructuring for the year ended december   the company recorded restructuring charges of million primarily related to a reevaluation of the assumptions used in determining the fair value of certain lease obligations related to facilities abandoned in a previous restructuring 
the revised assumptions  including lower estimates of expected sub rental income over the remainder of the lease terms and expected lease termination costs associated with exiting a portion of the facilities  are based on management s evaluation of the commercial rental market 
the above mentioned charges are net of a credit of million to previously recognized restructuring charges relating primarily to the adjustment for severance and other one time termination benefits associated with reduction in force actions and the consolidation of the company s rockville  maryland operations into its headquarters and manufacturing facility located in beverly  massachusetts 
in addition to the amounts reported as restructuring charges  million of relocation and other incremental expenses related to the consolidation of the rockville  maryland operations are included in general and administrative expense for the year ended december  in total  the company incurred approximately million in restructuring and general and administrative expenses related to these actions  all of which has been recognized in the statement of income since the fourth quarter of of the total cost related to these actions  approximately million is expected to result in cash expenditures  of which million has been paid through december  leases are expected to be paid over the remaining lease periods extending to the impact of these cost reductions on our liquidity has not been significant  as management estimates these actions have yielded equivalent cash savings 
changes in the company s restructuring liability are as follows severance retention leases total in thousands balance at december  restructuring expense credit cash payments balance at december  other income expense equity income attributable to sen was million in compared to million in fluctuations in equity contributions from sen reflect changes in its sales volume and net income resulting from demand changes in the japanese semiconductor market  and the timing of shipments in japan 
interest income of million primarily relates to interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
interest income increased by million from due primarily to higher interest rates earned on invested balances and an increase in average cash balances compared to  most of which came from the issuance of an additional million of convertible senior subordinated notes on may  interest expense of million in and million in primarily relates to our long term debt issued in january the increase of million relates primarily to our issuance of an additional million of convertible senior subordinated notes on may  which contain an effective yield to maturity of approximately

income tax expense relates principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions  principally in asia  where we earn taxable income 
we have significant net operating losses in the united states and certain foreign tax jurisdictions  principally europe  and  as a result  do not pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions nor have the ability to obtain tax benefit for such losses 
accordingly  our effective income tax rate is not meaningful 
year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  revenue systems revenue was million  or of revenue in  compared with million  or of revenue  in the decrease in sales of systems compared with was primarily attributable to weaker market demand resulting from lower levels of chip production by our semiconductor manufacturing customers 
also  while the effect is not yet quantifiable  systems revenue also declined because semiconductor manufacturers shifted away from our multi wafer high current ion implant systems to single wafer high current ion implant systems 
approximately of systems revenue in was from sales of mm products and were from sales of mm products  compared with and for sales of mm products and mm products in  respectively 
services revenue  which includes spare parts  equipment upgrades  and maintenance services  was million  or of revenue for  compared with million  or of revenue for services revenue fluctuates with capacity utilization by our customers  and the decline in services revenue for is attributable to declining utilization by semiconductor manufacturers

interest expense of million in and million in primarily relates to our long term debt issued in january income taxes income tax expense for was million 
income tax expense relates principally to operating results of foreign entities in jurisdictions  principally in asia  where we earn taxable income 
we have significant net operating losses in the united states and certain foreign tax jurisdictions  principally europe  and  as a result  do not pay significant income taxes in those jurisdictions nor have the ability to obtain tax benefit for such losses 
accordingly  our effective income tax rate is not meaningful 
liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities at december  were million  compared to million at december  the million increase in cash and cash equivalents and short term investments is mainly attributable to million in cash generated by operations  million from issuance of convertible debt and million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and stock purchases under the employee stock purchase plan  partially offset by million in capital expenditures and a million increase of restricted cash balances 
capital expenditures were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was primarily due to the completion of the consolidation of our rockville  maryland operations into our headquarters and manufacturing facility in beverly  massachusetts during we have no significant capital projects planned for and total capital expenditures for are projected to be less than million 
future capital expenditures beyond will depend on a number of factors  including the timing and rate of expansion of our business 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements other than foreign exchange contracts used to hedge amounts receivable from sen million at december  
we have net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards the tax effect of which aggregate million at december  these carryforwards  which expire principally between and  are available to reduce future income tax liabilities in the united states and certain foreign jurisdictions 
we had a million revolving credit facility that expired in october we are currently evaluating the need for a new credit facility and anticipate entering into a similar arrangement in as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  on may   we entered into an exchange and purchase agreement pursuant to which the holder of an aggregate of approximately million of our existing convertible subordinated notes due january  the old notes  agreed to exchange its old notes for million in aggregate principal amount of our newly issued convertible senior subordinated notes due january  the new notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest on the old notes through but excluding may   the closing date of the exchange 
at maturity  the company is required to repay the outstanding principal of the new notes  plus a maturity premium of of such principal  resulting in an effective annual yield to maturity of approximately 
in addition  we issued an additional million of new notes  resulting in an aggregate of million of new notes outstanding 
we repaid the remaining million of outstanding old notes in january we believe that our existing cash balances and expected positive cash flows for and will allow us to repay the new notes when they mature without causing a liquidity issue 
we have outstanding standby letters of credit  bank guarantees and surety bonds in the amount of million to support certain operating lease obligations  workers compensation insurance  and certain value added tax claims in europe 
in addition  at december   million of cash was pledged as collateral for certain outstanding standby letters of credit and bank guarantees and is reflected as restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
the following represents our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt including interest purchase order commitments operating leases amount of commitment expiration by period other commercial commitments total thereafter standby letters of credit guarantees axcelis liquidity is affected by many factors 
some of these factors are based on normal operations of the business and others relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the semiconductor equipment industry 
although our cash requirements fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities will be sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
recent accounting pronouncements sfas in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no

sfas provides guidance on the accounting for and reporting of accounting changes and error corrections 
it establishes  unless impracticable  retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to the newly adopted accounting principle 
the correction of an error in previously issued financial statements is not an accounting change 
however  the reporting of an error correction involves adjustments to previously issued financial statements similar to those generally applicable to reporting an accounting change retroactively 
therefore  the reporting of a correction of an error by restating previously issued financial statements is also addressed by this statement

outlook our performance is directly related to semiconductor manufacturers levels of capital expenditures to open new fabrication facilities and expand existing ones  as well as operational improvements we have implemented over the past several years 
the level of capital expenditures by these manufacturers depends upon the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products utilizing them  the available manufacturing capacity in manufacturers fabrication facilities  and the ability of manufacturers to increase productivity in existing facilities without incurring additional capital expenditures 
on january   we announced that net revenues excluding sen for the first quarter of are forecast in the range of million to million 
gross margins are projected in the to range 
we expect results of operations to be in the range of to per share 
in addition  we provided a summary of expectations for the total year 
revenues are anticipated to increase to over levels with revenues from sales of our single wafer optima products to contribute the majority of the increase 
gross margins are expected to remain in the low range 
it is difficult to predict our customers capital spending plans since they can change very quickly 
at our current sales level  each sale  or failure to make a sale  could have a material effect on our results of operations in a particular quarter 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity axcelis exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio  which consists entirely of cash equivalents and short term investments at december  the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in marketable high investment grade securities and limiting exposure to any one issue or issuer 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in managing our investment portfolio and  due to the nature of our investments  we do not expect our operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by any change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk substantially all of our sales are billed in us dollars  thereby reducing the impact of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on our results 
operating margins of certain foreign operations can fluctuate with changes in foreign exchange rates to the extent revenues are billed in us dollars and operating expenses are incurred in the local functional currency 
during the years ended december  and  approximately and of our revenues  respectively  were derived from foreign operations with this inherent risk 
in addition  at both december  and  our operations outside of the united states accounted for approximately of our total assets  the majority of which was denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
our investment in sen and our royalty and equity income from sen are subject to foreign currency exchange risks 
for royalties to be received in cash and certain other accounts receivable from sen million at december  we hedge our exposure to currency fluctuation through the use of forward contracts 
the effect of a depreciation of the japanese yen compared to the us dollar would result in a write down in our investment in sen and a corresponding decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity of million at december
