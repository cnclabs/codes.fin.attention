lydall does not undertake to update any forward looking statement made in this report or that may from time to time be made by or on behalf of the company 
overview and outlook business environment overview lydall designs and manufactures specialty engineered automotive thermal and acoustical barriers  passive and active industrial thermal and insulating solutions  filtration media  medical filtration media  devices and biopharmaceutical processing components for demanding thermal acoustical and filtration separation applications 
lydall s thermal acoustical and filtration separation businesses are in markets that present growth opportunities and the company expects the businesses to grow over the long term  primarily through the introduction of new products  expansion of share in existing markets and penetration of new markets 
in addition  the company continually explores its core markets for suitable strategic acquisitions  joint ventures  alliances and licensing agreements to supplement growth 
as many of lydall s operations conduct business on a worldwide basis  lydall s results can be impacted by global  regional and industry economic and political factors 

table of contents global automotive net sales represented approximately percent of the company s net sales 
during the third and fourth quarters of  certain domestic automakers announced facility closures and other restructuring actions that may impact future automobile production for platforms that include company content 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  the company experienced a reduction in automotive parts sales of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  compared to the same period in while the company experienced approximately percent growth in global automotive net sales in compared with  a reduction in vehicle production volumes  or a major decline in the production of specific vehicles in which lydall has significant content  could have a material adverse effect on the company s profitability in future quarters 
global environmental and economic conditions could also impact lydall s business segments 
significant increases in energy costs  as well as increases in raw material pricing  specifically  aluminum used in most of the company s heat shield products and various fibers used in a number of the company s thermal acoustical and filtration separation products  could increase manufacturing costs 
the company incurred higher aluminum costs during the second half of  compared to the first two quarters of  which lowered operating income during that period 
further increases in aluminum prices in the future could negatively impact the company  should the company not have the ability to pass some or all of these incremental costs on to its customers 
operational matters the air filtration business  which faced an increasingly price competitive environment during and  benefited from aggressive marketing activities and began to regain market share in the fourth quarter of the company strengthened its marketing team during the year and worked closely with customers both domestically and abroad to deliver value added products for their specific needs 
net sales in the air filtration business increased by approximately million  net of foreign currency translation impact  during the fourth quarter of compared to the same quarter of the company expects to regain additional market share in  however  the financial impact of these efforts cannot be determined at this time 
during the third and fourth quarters of  efforts at the vital fluids business  which is part of the company s filtration separation segment  to address the operational issues that caused an operating loss during and  have started to achieve results 
changes in management  higher sales and operational efficiency improvements  during the third and fourth quarters of  contributed to the vital fluids financial improvement as compared to the first half of in addition  the vital fluids business successfully completed the follow up federal drug administration audit related to the product recall with no deficiencies noted 
the company has continued to focus on lean six sigma and operational excellence initiatives 
the company benefited from savings and operating efficiency improvements as a result of the company s ongoing lean six sigma program 
as this process continues  the company anticipates that these efforts will continue to identify ways to improve processes and work flow  reduce costs and leverage synergies across the organization 
while management has started to see a positive impact on operating margins as a result of lean six sigma and operational excellence initiatives  the company cannot determine the timing and future impact of these initiatives at this time 
the company increased its focus on working capital management throughout the combination of the results of operations  lower cash cycle days average days of inventory plus average days of receivables minus average days of payables and containing capital expenditures allowed the company to reduce outstanding debt by million during as of december   the company has no borrowings outstanding under its domestic revolving credit facility 
the company began establishing its presence in china and leased warehouse space for filtration products during the fourth quarter of the near term goal is to set up a sales and service company with the capability of performing finishing operations in addition to acting as the central distribution and service facility for filtration products for asia 
the company is also focusing on establishing an asian presence for lydall s thermal acoustical products in this important market 
the company cannot determine the timing and future financial impact of these initiatives at this time 
the company continued efforts to establish its position with asian automotive transplants in north america 
the process is a long one 
the hamptonville facility was approved in as an official supplier by certain asian automotive transplants 
this is a very important step forward 
this approval does not give the company business  but it puts the company in position to quote and gain business in the future 
the future financial impact of these efforts to expand business with asian transplants cannot be determined at this time

other products and services net sales increased by million in  as compared with foreign currency translation increased net sales by million for the current year  compared with  primarily impacting the thermal acoustical group by million 
the increase in net sales in of million  compared with  was primarily the result of increased sales from the automotive businesses of the thermal acoustical segment of million  partially offset by a decrease in sales in the filtration separation segment of million 
foreign currency translation had a minimal impact on net sales in  compared to the increase in automotive sales occurred at both the domestic and european automotive businesses 
the decrease in the filtration separation segment was primarily attributable to an million decrease in filtration sales and a million decrease in sales of vital fluids products 
gross margin in thousands of dollars gross margin percentage of sales the increase in gross margin percentage in to percent from percent in the same period of was principally due to increased gross margins in the company s thermal acoustical segment  primarily related to improved margins on automotive products of  offset by a small decrease in gross margin percentage for the filtration separation segment 
overall  gross margin percentage increased due to manufacturing process improvements  resulting from lean six sigma and operational excellence initiatives  partially offset by higher raw material and commodity pricing in the improvement in gross margin percentage in to percent from percent in was due to the absence of certain charges that had an unfavorable impact on gross margin percentage 
restructuring charges related to the consolidation of the domestic automotive facilities and the negative gross margin performance related to the start up activity of the automotive operation in france  reduced the gross margin percentage from percent to percent 
after excluding these charges from results  the gross margin percentage in decreased by percentage points compared to the decrement in gross margin percentage was primarily attributable to lower sales volumes and the resultant higher per unit manufacturing costs in the filtration business 
selling  product development and administrative expenses in thousands of dollars selling  product development and administrative expenses percentage of sales the increase in selling  product development and administrative expenses of million in  compared to  was primarily due to increases in incentive compensation expense of million  sales commission expense of million  stock based compensation expense of million  primarily from the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas r  share based payment  and salaries and benefits expense of million 
offsetting these increases were decreases of million in compliance costs related to the sarbanes oxley act and employee severance related expenses of million 
the increase in net sales for the year  compared to the prior year  contributed to higher sales commission expense in the current year 
the increase in incentive compensation expense was primarily due to improved profitability by the company in compared to higher salaries and benefits expense was primarily due to annual wage adjustments and increased health insurance costs  offset by a reduction in benefit plan expense of million  as a result of previously announced changes to the company s benefit plans 

table of contents the decrease in selling  product development and administrative expenses of million in  compared to  was primarily due to lower costs in related to sarbanes oxley section compliance of million and lower legal costs associated with litigation against a former employee of million in  offset by million recorded in related to the elimination of the chief operating officer position and increases in salaries and commissions of million 
in addition  the company made investments in product development of million in  compared with million in excluding the sarbanes oxley section compliance costs  legal fees associated with a former employee and costs related to the elimination of the chief operating officer position  in the respective periods  selling  product development and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales for was essentially the same as for restructuring activities in thousands of dollars restructuring charges as part of a strategic evaluation initiated in the fourth quarter of  the company implemented a plan to maximize production capacity utilization  reallocate administrative costs to more beneficial operational efforts and more effectively respond to market demands for increasingly faster  technologically advanced cost effective solutions 
as a result  the company consolidated the operations of the columbus manufacturing operation into existing lydall facilities 
the company substantially completed the restructuring and consolidation of its domestic automotive manufacturing operations as of december  the total costs related to the restructuring effort recorded through december  were approximately million  which included million of severance and related costs  million of accelerated depreciation and million of facility exit and move costs 
approximately percent of all restructuring costs incurred were recorded in cost of sales and percent were recorded in selling  product development and administrative expenses 
approximately percent of restructuring costs were recorded in the thermal acoustical segment and percent were recorded as corporate office expenses 
interest expense in thousands of dollars interest expense weighted average interest rate during the year the decrease in interest expense in was due to lower average debt levels in compared to  partially offset by higher interest rates and accretion of interest expense of approximately million on the company s liabilities for asset retirement obligations

these third quarter adjustments primarily contributed to reducing the company s effective tax rate for the year ended december   as compared to the federal statutory tax rate on earnings 
the effective tax rates for and were impacted favorably by benefits derived from the recognition of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions as well as tax exempt export income 
the effective tax rate was also favorably impacted by the completion of a tax audit at one of the company s foreign locations  adjustments for foreign taxes  and benefits recognized on certain state credits and state loss carryforwards 
the and effective rates were negatively impacted by certain state franchise and alternative taxes  which do not directly fluctuate with the level of income

fin 
this interpretation clarified the timing of liability recognition for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets when the timing and or method of settlement of the obligation are conditional on a future event 
fin requires that the fair value of a liability for a conditional asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it occurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the company determined that conditional legal obligations exist for certain of the company s owned and leased facilities related primarily to building materials and leasehold improvements 
the company adopted fin on october   which resulted in a non cash cumulative effect of change in accounting principle charge to the results of operations of approximately million  net of income taxes  and a liability for conditional asset retirement obligations of approximately million

the increase in segment net sales primarily resulted from increased passive thermal products net sales of million during  compared to the same period in the increased sales were primarily related to products used in heating  ventilating and air conditioning systems  appliances and hearths due to greater global demand and market growth for these products 
also contributing to the increase in segment net sales in  compared to  was an increase in automotive parts net sales of approximately million  net of impact of foreign currency translation  offset by lower automotive tooling net sales of million for the comparable periods 
sales growth of automotive parts was achieved in both north america and in europe through platform and content expansion during the first half of part sales declined during the second half of due to lower production by domestic automakers and a slowdown in the french automotive market 
sales to the automotive industry accounted for approximately percent of segment net sales in  compared to approximately percent in sales of affinity temperature control active thermal products were higher by million in compared to the prior year 
the increase in operating income in the thermal acoustical segment for of million  as compared to  was primarily due to an increase in operating income from the automotive operations of million  and to a lesser extent from passive thermal products of million  partially offset by a decrease of million in active thermal operating income 
the increase in automotive operating income was primarily due to higher volume of automotive part sales and increased gross margin percentages 
gross margin percentages improved due to manufacturing process improvements and cost reduction initiatives  as well as higher volumes during the period 
the increase in operating income for passive thermal products was primarily due to increased net sales during  compared to  partially offset by increased selling  product development and administrative expenses 
the decrease in operating income for active thermal products was due to lower gross margin percentage as a result of higher 
table of contents manufacturing and warranty costs 
reducing segment operating income during  compared to  was increased selling  product development and administrative expenses of million  primarily due to increased incentive compensation expense of million and sales commission expense of million  offset by lower benefit plan expense of million 
net sales in for the thermal acoustical segment increased by million  or percent  as compared to the impact of foreign currency translation was minimal on segment net sales for this increase in net sales was primarily the result of increased overall sales from the automotive businesses of million during  compared with sales to the automotive industry accounted for approximately percent of segment net sales in  compared to approximately percent in sales growth of automotive products was achieved in both north america and in europe through platform and content expansion 
the company is also benefiting from a strengthening collaboration between our european and domestic operations 
this dynamic enables the company to work with customers on a much broader basis  resulting in increased business with european transplants in the united states 
sales from the industrial thermal businesses increased by less than million in compared with the prior year 
modest increases in sales of affinity temperature control active thermal products were partially offset by sales declines in passive thermal products such as building material products used principally in heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac applications 
segment operating income and operating margin percentage in increased by million and percentage points  respectively  compared to a significant portion of these increases were due to the absence of certain charges that had an unfavorable impact on operating income and operating margin percentage 
restructuring charges related to the consolidation of the domestic automotive facilities and operating losses at the start up activity of the automotive operation in france  reduced operating income by million 
after excluding these charges from results  operating income in increased by million  or percent and operating margin percentage increased by percentage points compared to the increases in operating income and operating margin percentage were primarily the result of the european automotive operation s significant improvements in overall profitability in with the transfer of business from the german operation to the st 
nazaire facility 
this translated into improved absorption of overall costs in france and the elimination of certain incremental costs at the operation in germany 
operating income of the industrial thermal businesses declined by million in compared with primarily related to changes in product mix at the passive and active thermal businesses 
filtration separation segment net sales increased by million in  compared with the impact of foreign currency translation in was minimal 
the overall increase was related to increased sales for vital fluids products of million and liquid filtration products of million  partially offset by a decrease of air filtration media net sales of million 
the increase in vital fluids products net sales was primarily attributable to increased bioprocessing net sales of million  and increased blood product net sales of million 
bioprocessing net sales increased due to increased customer production campaigns 
blood product net sales were higher in the current year due to the prior year being impacted by the blood product recall 
liquid filtration net sales increased due to increased demand from existing and new customers and the introduction of new products 
the decrease in air filtration media net sales was related to pricing competition in certain markets throughout most of during the fourth quarter of  the company s air filtration business began to regain market share by working closely with its customers to deliver value added products to meet their specific needs 
net sales for air filtration media increased million  net of foreign currency translation  in the fourth quarter of  as compared to the same period in segment operating income decreased million in compared with higher selling  product development and administrative expenses of million in compared to the same period in offset the improvement in segment gross margin 
this increase in expense was primarily due to increases in salaries and wages expense of million  incentive compensation of million  sales commission expense of million and severance expense of million partially offset by a decrease in benefit plan expense of million 
vital fluid s operating income was also negatively impacted by inventory obsolescence and a quality issue resulting in charges aggregating approximately million in the decrease in overall segment operating income was also related to lower gross margin contribution by air filtration products  as a result of lower sales  partially offset by improvement in the liquid filtration business gross margin due to increased sales 
segment net sales decreased by million  or percent  in compared to the prior year 
the impact of foreign currency translation was minimal on segment net sales for the decrease was related to substantially lower sales of filtration media and vital fluids products of million and million  respectively  compared with the decline in filtration media was related to reductions in sales of air filtration media used in clean room filtration applications as a result of reduced clean room builds in asia compared with levels 
in addition  sales of other air filtration media decreased due to pricing competition in certain 
table of contents markets 
vital fluids sales decreased due to lower sales of blood transfusion and cell therapy products of million  lower bio processing products sales of million  and lower sales of traditional oem products of million 
the decrease in blood related product sales was related to the product recall previously disclosed  delays in the resumption of shipping of these products due to the validation of the sterilization process and the phase out of certain other blood related products 
the reduction in bio processing sales was primarily related to the change in sales philosophy for these products in prior years from a direct sales approach to external distributors 
this move proved ineffective and the company has moved back to a direct sales force approach 
segment operating income in decreased by million  or percent  from and operating margin percentage decreased to percent in from percent in the prior year 
these declines were substantially related to lower sales of filtration media and vital fluids products and the corresponding reduction in gross margin contribution 
exacerbating this sales volume impact was the under absorption of manufacturing costs related to the reduced production runs during the period  resulting in higher per unit product costs 
the operating loss for the vital fluids business was million greater in compared to a small operating loss in other products and services the increase in other products and services ops net sales of million in  compared to  was related to increased revenues from the trucking and warehousing operations of the transport business and specialty products 
the trucking operations were able to post higher revenues compared with the same period of through expanded sales to current customers and negotiated price increases 
the warehousing operations have benefited from a higher volume of activity 
a stronger electrical market led to higher specialty product sales in compared to operating income from ops increased by million in compared to the same period in operating margin percentage for ops increased to percent of net sales in  compared with percent of net sales in these increases were primarily due to increased net sales of trucking and warehousing operations and specialty products  as well as improved gross margin percentages for specialty products 
the increase in net sales from ops of million in was primarily related to increased revenue for the trucking operations of the transport business of million  partially offset by decreased specialty product sales of million 
the increase in the transport business relates to increased business volume from certain customers and price increases 
operating income from ops decreased by million for compared with the prior year

critical accounting estimates the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
note in notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
the company s management is 
table of contents required to make judgments and estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual results could differ from management s estimates 
the most significant areas involving management judgments and estimates are described below 
intangible assets and goodwill the company accounts for business acquisitions under the purchase method whereby the assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition 
goodwill represents the costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses 
the company had goodwill recorded of million at december  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  fas requires that goodwill and other intangible assets determined to have indefinite lives not be amortized  but rather are subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the specific guidance and criteria described in the standard 
the identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of reporting units as defined in fas  including related goodwill 
the estimates of fair value of reporting units are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment  which incorporate management assumptions about expected future cash flows  as well as other factors 
future cash flows can be affected by numerous factors including changes in economic  industry or market conditions  changes in the underlying business or products of the reporting unit  changes in competition and changes in technology 
any changes in key assumptions about the business and its prospects  changes in any of the factors discussed above or other factors could affect the fair value of one or more of the reporting units resulting in an impairment charge 
such a charge could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial condition and results of operations 
although no goodwill impairment has been recorded to date  there can be no assurance that a future impairment of goodwill will not occur 
see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the vital fluids business  which is part of the company s filtration separation segment and a reporting unit as defined in fas  has goodwill of million recorded at december  in january  the company announced a product recall of certain of its blood transfer and storage products 
the company recorded expense related to this matter in the fourth quarter of  which caused the vital fluids business to report an operating loss in the vital fluids business also reported operating losses in and  as the recall resulted in lower sales of blood related products  as well as rework  revalidation and other direct and indirect recall related costs during those periods 
in the third quarter of  the vital fluids business successfully completed the follow up federal drug administration audit related to the product recall with no deficiencies noted 
also  in the third and fourth quarters of  sales of blood related products began to approach levels achieved prior to the recall 
in addition  there were changes in senior management  a strengthening of the sales force  an increased focus on product development  and operational efficiency improvements at the vital fluids business during the last two quarters of the company expects that the return to more normal levels of blood product sales  the absence of additional recall related costs  as well as the other changes and improvements at the vital fluids business  will contribute to improved financial performance in future periods 
the company s annual goodwill impairment testing analysis analysis included projected operating income and positive cash flows for the vital fluids business over the next five years 
based on those projections and other assumptions used in the analysis  the company concluded that the fair value of the vital fluids business exceeded the carrying value of its net assets  and there was no impairment of goodwill 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate used in the analysis would not change the company s conclusion 
in addition  the analysis indicated that a reduction in the projected operating income of the vital fluids business over the next five years of approximately percent  would require the company to perform an additional step as required by fas to measure the amount of an impairment loss  if any 
the company expects the vital fluids business to achieve these future levels of operating income and positive cash flows  however  if the vital fluids business does not achieve these results in the future there could be a partial or full impairment of its goodwill

an employer with publicly traded equity securities is required to initially recognize the funded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan and to provide the required disclosures as of the end of the first fiscal year ending after december  the company adopted fas on december  for its defined benefit pension plans and the impact was not material to the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as of or for the year ended december  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
pension cost and the related obligations recognized in the consolidated financial statements are determined on an actuarial basis 
the determination of such amounts is made in consultation with the company s outside actuary based on information and assumptions provided by the company 
a substantial portion of the company s pension amounts relate to its defined benefit plans in the united states 
on april   the board of directors of the company approved an amendment to certain of the company s domestic defined benefit pension plans  effective june   which provided that benefits under these pension plans will stop accruing for all eligible employees not covered under a collective bargaining agreement 
the amendment resulted in a pension curtailment loss of  during the second quarter of this amendment will significantly reduce pension cost in future years due to the majority of employees no longer accruing benefits under the domestic defined benefit pension plans 
a significant element in determining the company s pension cost is the expected return on plan assets 
based on a review of market trends  actual returns on plan assets and other factors  the company s expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent will be utilized for determining pension cost  which was also used for the investment plan assets are stated at fair value  which is based on quoted market prices in an active market 
the expected long term rate of return on assets is applied to the value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension cost for that year 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred  within certain parameters  as discussed below 
the company continually evaluates its expected long term rate of return and will adjust such rate as deemed appropriate 
at the end of each year  the company determines the discount rate to be used to calculate the present value of plan liabilities  as well as the following year s pension cost 
the discount rate is an estimate of the current interest rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year 
in estimating this rate  the company looks to rates of return on high quality  bond indices 
however  these indices give only an indication of the appropriate discount rate because the cash flows of the bonds comprising the indices do not match the projected benefit payment stream of the plan precisely 
for this reason  the company also considers the individual characteristics of the plan  such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations  when setting the discount rate 
at december   the company determined this rate to be percent  a decrease of basis points from the rate used at april  to re measure the pension plan liabilities at the pension amendment date  an increase of basis points from the rate used at december  and identical to the discount rate used at december  increases or decreases in the discount rate result in decreases and increases  respectively  in the projected benefit obligation 
the net effect on pension liabilities from changes in the discount rate is deferred within certain parameters  as discussed below 
fas requires that gains or losses as defined in fas be deferred unless the unrecognized net gain or loss at the end of a year exceeds a corridor as defined in fas 
if the deferred gain or loss exceeds the corridor at the end of the year  then the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over a period equal to the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits 
since benefit accruals were frozen on certain domestic defined benefit plans on june   these plan participants are considered inactive participants 
therefore  the gain loss amortization for and beyond for these plans will be amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of all plan participants 
as of december  and  the net deferred loss exceeded the corridor 
consequently pension cost for will include amortization of a portion of the deferred loss in excess of the corridor 
the amount of amortization in future years will be dependent on changes in the components of the deferred loss amount  particularly actual return on plan assets in relation to the estimated return on plan assets  as well as future increases or decreases in the discount rate 
for the year ended december   the company recognized pension cost of million net of a curtailment loss of less than million related to the pension amendment described above 
as discussed above  the company s discount rate was percent at december  and was used for purposes of determining pension cost 
pension cost is expected to be minimal for see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company contributed approximately million to its defined benefit pension plans during and expects to contribute approximately million in

 considering the effects of prior year misstatements in current year financial statements sab 
sab was issued in order to eliminate the diversity of practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements 
traditionally  there have been two widely recognized methods for quantifying the effects of financial statement misstatements the rollover method and the iron curtain method 
the rollover method focuses primarily on the impact of misstatements on the income statement  including the reversing effect of prior year misstatements  but its use can lead to the accumulation of misstatements in the balance sheet 
the iron curtain method  on the other hand  focuses primarily on the effect of correcting the period end balance sheet with less emphasis on the reversing effects of prior year errors on the income statement 
prior to the application of the guidance in sab  lydall used the rollover method for quantifying financial statement misstatements 
in sab  the sec staff established an approach that requires quantification of financial statement misstatements based on the effects of the misstatements on each of the company s financial statements and the related financial statement disclosures 
this model is commonly referred to as a dual approach because it requires quantifications of errors under both the iron curtain and rollover methods 
sab permits existing public companies to initially apply its provision either by i restating prior financial statements as if the dual approach had always been used or ii recording the cumulative effect of initially applying the dual approach as adjustments to the carrying values of assets and liabilities as of january  with an offsetting adjustment recorded to the opening balance of retained earnings 
the company applied the provisions of sab using the cumulative effect transition method in connection with the preparation of its annual financial statements for the year ended december  consequently  the company recorded a decrease in net deferred income tax liabilities in the amount of million and an increase in retained earnings of million as of january  see note in notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  fas which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
fas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  related to future tax benefits arising from deductible temporary differences and tax carryforwards were million and million at december  and  respectively 
management believes that the company s earnings during the periods when the temporary differences become deductible will be sufficient to realize the related net future income tax benefits 
for those jurisdictions where the projected operating results indicate that the ability to realize the future benefits is uncertain or not likely  a valuation allowance has been provided 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  the company estimates future taxable income  considering the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies and the realizability of tax loss carryforwards 
valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes in tax law  changes in statutory tax rates and future levels of taxable income 
in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future  the company would reduce such amounts through a charge to income in the period that such determination was made 
conversely  if the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts  the company would decrease the recorded valuation allowance and record an increase to income in the period that such determination was made
