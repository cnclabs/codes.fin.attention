item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general 
we are in the process of identifying potential joint venture partners and buyers for our commercial assets to be sold 
thus  the terms of any joint venture arrangements and asset sale transactions have not yet been negotiated  and no assurances can be given as to the structure or terms of such transactions or the impacts of such transactions on our financial condition or results of operations 
see risk factors risks associated with our current strategy to change our asset mix 
financing strategy we seek to maintain a well balanced  conservative and flexible capital structure by maintaining conservative debt service and fixed charge coverage ratios in order to sustain our investment grade status  extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt  borrowing primarily at fixed rates  and generally pursuing long term debt financings and refinancings on an unsecured basis 
we believe that these strategies have enabled  and should continue to enable  us to access the debt and equity capital markets to fund debt refinancings and the acquisition and development of additional properties 
we may modify our borrowing policy and may increase or decrease our ratio of debt to gross asset value in the future 
to the extent that our board of trustees determines to seek additional capital  we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings  debt financings  asset dispositions or retention of cash flow subject to provisions in the internal revenue code of  as amended  requiring the distribution by a reit of a certain percentage of taxable income and taking into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income or a combination of these methods 
we have historically funded our acquisition and development activities primarily through proceeds received from the disposition of assets  unsecured senior notes offerings and advances on our unsecured bank line of credit 
for additional information regarding current year financing activities and year end balances  refer to item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this form k 
property management we are experienced in the management and leasing of multifamily  office and retail properties and believe that the management and leasing of our own portfolio has helped maintain consistent income growth and has resulted in reduced operating expenses from the properties 
the third party management  leasing and brokerage businesses conducted through cpsi have provided us both with a source of cash flow that is relatively stable and with the benefits of economies of scale in conjunction with the management and leasing of our own properties 
these businesses also allow us to establish additional relationships with tenants who may require additional office or retail space and help us to identify potential acquisitions 
operational structure we currently manage our business through three operating divisions multifamily  office and retail 
we have centralized functions that are common to each division  including accounting  information technology and administrative services 
decisions regarding acquisitions  developments and dispositions are also centralized 
generally  each division has an executive vice president that oversees growth and operations and has a separate management team that is responsible for acquiring  developing  and leasing properties within each division 
this structure allows us to utilize specialized management personnel for each operating division 
although these divisions operate independently from one another  we believe that constant communication among the executive vice presidents provides us with unique synergies allowing us to take advantage of a variety of investment opportunities 
in addition  we believe our three division structure allows us to better manage the development of mixed use projects 
see note segment information in our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k for information on our three segments and the reconciliation of total segment revenues to total revenues  total segment net operating income to income from continuing operations and minority interest for the years ended december   and  and total divisional assets to total assets for the years ended december  
table of contents and information regarding our segments contained in such note segment information in our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k is incorporated by reference herein 
additional information with respect to each of the operating divisions is set forth below multifamily division 
our multifamily division is responsible for all aspects of multifamily operations  including day to day management and leasing of our multifamily apartment communities  as well as providing third party management services for apartment communities in which we do not have an ownership interest or have a non controlling ownership interest 
additionally  all of the company s condominium conversion properties and related sales are managed by the multifamily division 
office division 
our office division is responsible for all aspects of our commercial office operations  including the management and leasing services for our office properties  as well as third party management services for office properties in which we do not have an ownership interest and for brokerage services in other office property transactions 
retail division 
our retail division is responsible for all aspects of our retail operations  including the management and leasing services for our retail properties  as well as third party management services for retail properties in which we do not have an ownership interest and for brokerage services in other retail property transactions 
competition the ownership  development  operation and leasing of multifamily  office and retail properties are highly competitive 
we compete with domestic and foreign financial institutions  other reits  life insurance companies  pension trusts  trust funds  partnerships and individual investors for the acquisition of properties 
see item a risk factors risks associated with our operations competition for acquisitions could reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and result in increased prices for properties  which could adversely affect our return on properties we purchase in this form k for further discussion 
in addition  we compete for tenants in our markets primarily on the basis of property location  rent charged  services provided and the design and condition of improvements 
seasonality our multifamily apartment communities and office properties generally are not affected by seasonality 
however  the retail shopping center industry is seasonal in nature  with shopping center tenant sales peaking during the fourth quarter due to the holiday season 
as a result  a substantial portion of the percentage rent that we receive from our retail properties is not recognized until the fourth quarter 
furthermore  most new retail lease up occurs towards the later part of the year in anticipation of the holiday season and most vacancies occur toward the beginning of the year 
in addition  the majority of our retail temporary tenants take occupancy in the fourth quarter 
accordingly  retail cash flow and occupancy levels are generally lowest in the first quarter and highest in the fourth quarter 
environmental matters we believe that our properties are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances 
we are not aware of any environmental condition which we believe would have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position before consideration of any potential insurance coverage 
nevertheless  it is possible that there are material environmental liabilities of which we are unaware 
moreover  no assurances can be given that i future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability or ii the current environmental condition of our properties has not been or will not be affected by tenants and occupants of our properties  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of our properties or by third parties unrelated to us 
see risk factors risks associated with our operations we could incur significant costs related to environmental issues which could adversely affect our results of operations through increased compliance costs or our financial condition if we become subject to a significant liability in this form k for further discussion 

table of contents insurance we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance on all of our majority owned properties 
we believe the policy specifications  insured limits of these policies and self insurance reserves are adequate and appropriate 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as lease and other contract claims  which generally are not insured 
we anticipate that we will review our insurance coverage and policies from time to time to determine the appropriate levels of coverage  but we cannot predict at this time if we will be able to obtain or maintain full coverage at reasonable costs in the future 
in addition  as of december   we are self insured up to million  million and million for general liability  workers compensation and property insurance  respectively 
we are also self insured for health insurance and responsible for claims up to  per claim and up to million per person 
our policy for all self insured risk is to accrue for expected losses on reported claims and for estimated losses related to claims incurred but not reported as of the end of the reporting period 
see risk factors risks associated with our operations uninsured or underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition 
employees as of december   crlp employed approximately  persons  including on site property employees who provide services for the properties that we own and or manage 
tax status we are considered a corporation for federal income tax purposes 
we qualify as a reit and generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute our reit taxable income to our shareholders 
reits are subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property 
distributions to shareholders are generally partially taxable as ordinary income and long term capital gains  and partially non taxable as return of capital 
during  our distributions had the following characteristics distribution ordinary per share income capital gain in addition  our financial statements include the operations of a taxable reit subsidiary  cpsi  which is not entitled to a dividends paid deduction and is subject to federal  state and local income taxes 
cpsi provides property management  construction management and development services for third party owned properties and administrative services to us 
in addition  we perform all of our for sale residential and condominium conversion activities through cpsi 
we generally reimburse cpsi for payroll and other costs incurred in providing services to us 
all inter company transactions are eliminated in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we recognized tax expense of million and million in and  respectively  related to the taxable income of cpsi

table of contents item a 
risk factors set forth below are the risks that we believe are material to investors who purchase or own our common  preferred or debt securities 
you should consider carefully the following risks  together with the other information contained in and incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  and the descriptions included in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
risks associated with our current strategy to change our asset mix we are in the process of changing our business plan to focus predominately on multifamily properties and face certain risks inherent in the implementation of this strategy 
in connection with our recently announced strategic plan to focus on multifamily properties  over the next six to twelve months we plan to sell the majority of our wholly owned office and retail assets into a series of joint ventures in which we anticipate retaining a minority interest  and which we currently expect to manage 
in addition  we expect to sell other office and retail assets outright 
we currently estimate that  once the anticipated sales are complete  our annualized net operating income from multifamily operations will represent approximately percent of our total net operating income  as compared to approximately percent of our total net operating income as of december  the implementation of this strategy will be subject to various risks  including the following potential disruptions in our operations  the diversion of management s attention from day to day operations to the disposition of our office and retail assets  we may experience difficulties and incur unanticipated expenses relating to the proposed dispositions  we may not achieve anticipated cost savings and operating efficiencies from our focus on multifamily properties  and multifamily properties may not perform as well as we anticipate due to various factors  including changes in economic conditions and the demand for multifamily properties generally 
we are currently in the process of identifying joint venture partners and buyers for the commercial assets to be sold 
as such  the terms of any joint venture arrangements and asset sale transactions have not yet been negotiated  and no assurances can be made as to the structure  price or other terms of such transactions or the impact of such transactions on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  any joint ventures that we form in connection with this strategy will involve risks not customarily associated with our wholly owned properties 
see risk factors risks associated with our operations our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition  any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 
as a result of our strategic plan to focus predominately on multifamily properties  our revenues will be significantly influenced by demand for multifamily properties generally  and a decrease in such demand would likely have a greater adverse effect on our revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
as discussed above  we intend to change the asset mix of our portfolio and focus predominately on multifamily properties 
as a result of this strategy  we will be subject to greater extent to risks inherent in investments in a single industry 
a decrease in the demand for multifamily properties would likely have a greater adverse effect on our rental revenues than if we owned a more diversified real estate portfolio 
tenant demand at multifamily properties has been and could be adversely affected by weakness in the national  regional and local economies  changes in job growth  household formation or population growth in our markets  changes in interest rates or changes in supply of  or demand for  similar or competing multifamily properties in an area 
to the extent that any of these conductions occur  they are likely to affect market rents at multifamily properties  which could cause a decrease in our rental revenue 
any such decrease could impair our ability to satisfy our substantial debt service obligations or make distributions to our shareholders 

table of contents risks associated with real estate we face numerous risks associated with the real estate industry that could adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
as a real estate company  we are subject to various changes in real estate conditions  any negative trends of which may adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
these conditions include worsening of national and regional economic conditions  as well as the local economic conditions in our principal market areas  the existence and quality of the competition  such as the attractiveness of our property as compared to our competitors properties based on considerations such as convenience of location  rental rates  amenities and safety record  increased operating costs  including increased real property taxes  maintenance  insurance and utilities costs  weather conditions that may increase or decrease energy costs and other weather related expenses  oversupply of multifamily  office or retail space or a reduction in demand for real estate in the markets in which our properties are located  a favorable interest rate environment that may result in a significant number of potential tenants of our multifamily properties deciding to purchase homes instead of renting  and changing trends in the demand by consumers for merchandise offered by retailers conducting business at our retail properties 
moreover  other factors may affect our results of operations adversely  including changes in government regulations and other laws  rules and regulations governing real estate  zoning or taxes  changes in interest rate levels  the availability of financing and potential liability under environmental and other laws and other unforeseen events  most of which are discussed elsewhere in the following risk factors 
any or all of these factors could materially adversely affect our results of operations through decreased revenues or increased costs 
real estate investments are illiquid  and therefore we may not be able to sell our properties in response to economic changes which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
real estate investments generally are relatively illiquid and as a result we may not be able to sell a property or properties quickly or on favorable terms in response to changes in the economy or other conditions when it otherwise may be prudent to do so 
this inability to respond quickly to changes in the performance of our properties could adversely affect our results of operations if we cannot sell an unprofitable property 
our financial condition could also be adversely affected if we were  for example  unable to sell one or more of our properties in order to meet our debt obligations upon maturity 
in addition  the tax laws applicable to reits require that we hold our properties for investment  rather than primarily for sale in the ordinary course of business  which may cause us to forego or defer sales of properties that otherwise would be in our best interest 
therefore  we may be unable to vary our portfolio promptly in response to market conditions  which may adversely affect our financial position 
we are subject to significant regulation  which could adversely affect our results of operations through increased costs and or an inability to pursue business opportunities 
local zoning and use laws  environmental statutes and other governmental requirements may restrict our development  expansion  rehabilitation and reconstruction activities 
these regulations may prevent or delay us from taking advantage of economic opportunities 
if we fail to comply with these requirements  governmental authorities may impose fines on us or private litigants may be awarded damages against us 
in addition  we cannot predict what requirements may be enacted in the future or that such a requirement will not increase our costs of regulatory compliance or prohibit us from pursuing business opportunities that could be profitable to us 
compliance or failure to comply with the americans with disabilities act could result in substantial costs 
under the americans with disabilities act of  or ada  and various state and local laws  all public accommodations and commercial facilities  including office buildings  must meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
compliance with these requirements could involve removal of structural 
table of contents barriers from certain disabled persons entrances 
other federal  state and local laws may require modifications to or restrict further renovations of our properties with respect to such means of access 
noncompliance with the ada or related laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines by government authorities  the award to private litigants of damages against us or the incurrence of additional costs associated with bringing the properties into compliance 
risks associated with our operations the development or conversion of for sale projects could adversely affect our results of operations 
we intend to develop for sale assets and may continue to convert existing apartment communities into condominium units for sale 
for sale development and conversion activities may be conducted through wholly owned affiliated companies or through joint ventures 
our for sale development and conversion activities may expose us to the following risks we may be unable to obtain  or face delays in obtaining  necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations  which could result in increased development costs and or lower than expected sales  local real estate market conditions  such as oversupply or reduction in demand  may result in reduced or fluctuating sales  we may incur development or conversion costs for a property that exceed original estimates due to increased materials  labor or other costs or unforeseen environmental conditions  which could make completion of the property uneconomical  land  insurance and construction costs continue to increase in our markets and may continue to increase in the future and we may be unable to attract rents  or sales prices with respect to for sale product  that compensate for these increases in costs  for sale properties under development or acquired for development usually generate little or no cash flow until completion of development and sale of a significant number of homes or condominium units and may experience operating deficits after the date of completion and until such homes or condominium units are sold  we may abandon development or conversion opportunities that we have already begun to explore  and we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in connection with exploring any such opportunities  buyers may be unable to qualify for financing  sale prices may be lower than anticipated  we may be unable to close on sales of individual units under contract  and we could be subject to liability claims from condominium associations or others asserting that construction performed was defective  resulting in litigation and or settlement discussions 
recently  there has been a softening in the condominium and single family housing markets due to increasing mortgage financing rates  increasing supplies of such assets  rising insurance costs  uncertainties related to the cost of energy and a perceived slow down in overall economic activity in the u 
s  resulting in lower sales prices and reduced sales velocity 
there can be no assurances of the amount or pace of future for sale residential sales and closings 
additional softening in the for sale residential market could result in lower margins on sales and additional impairment of assets 
our properties may not generate sufficient rental income to pay our expenses if we are unable to lease our new properties or renew leases or re lease space at our existing properties as leases expire  which may adversely affect our operating results 
we derive the majority of our income from tenants who lease space from us at our properties 
a number of factors may adversely affect our ability to attract tenants at favorable rental rates and generate sufficient income  including local conditions such as an oversupply of  or reduction in demand for  multifamily  office or retail properties  
table of contents the attractiveness of our properties to residents  shoppers and tenants  decreases in market rental rates  and our ability to collect rent from our tenants 
if we cannot generate sufficient income to pay our expenses  maintain our properties and service our debt as a result of any of these factors  our operating results may be adversely affected 
the tenants at our multifamily properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from six months to one year 
tenants at our office properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from three to ten years and tenants at our retail properties generally enter into leases with an initial term ranging from one to ten years 
as leases expire at our existing properties  tenants may elect not to renew them 
even if the tenants do renew or if we can re lease the space  the terms of renewal or re leasing  including the cost of required renovations may be less favorable than current lease terms 
in addition  for new properties  we may be unable to attract enough tenants and the occupancy rates and rents may not be sufficient to make the property profitable 
if we are unable to renew the leases or re lease the space at our existing properties promptly and or lease the space at our new properties  or if the rental rates upon renewal or re leasing at existing properties are significantly lower than expected rates  our operating results will be negatively affected 
we may not be able to control our operating costs or our expenses may remain constant  even if our revenues decrease  causing our results of operations to be adversely affected 
factors that may adversely affect our ability to control operating costs include the need to pay for insurance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes  which could increase over time  the need periodically to repair  renovate and re lease space  the cost of compliance with governmental regulation  including zoning and tax laws  the potential for liability under applicable laws  interest rate levels  and the availability of financing 
if our operating costs increase as a result of any of the foregoing factors  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
the expense of owning and operating a property is not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 
as a result  if revenues drop  we may not be able to reduce our expenses accordingly 
costs associated with real estate investments  such as real estate taxes  loan payments and maintenance generally will not be reduced even if a property is not fully occupied or other circumstances cause our revenues to decrease 
if a property is mortgaged and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments  the lender could foreclose on the mortgage and take the property  resulting in a further reduction in net income 
an economic downturn  a natural disaster or an act of terrorism in an area in which our properties are concentrated could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition 
substantially all of our properties are located in the sunbelt region of the united states 
in particular  we derived approximately of our net operating income in from top quartile cities located in the sunbelt region 
if the sunbelt region of the united states  and in particular the areas of or near birmingham  charlotte  orlando  atlanta  dallas or fort worth experience a slowdown in the economy  a natural disaster or an act of terrorism  our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected as a result of decreased revenues  increased costs or damage or loss of assets 
tenant bankruptcies and downturns in tenants businesses may adversely affect our operating results by decreasing our revenues 
at any time  a tenant may experience a downturn in its business that may weaken its financial condition 
as a result  our tenants may delay lease commencement  cease or defer making rental payments or declare bankruptcy 
a 
table of contents bankruptcy filing by or relating to one of our tenants would bar all efforts by us to collect pre bankruptcy debts from that tenant  or their property  unless we receive an order permitting us to do so from the bankruptcy court 
a tenant bankruptcy could delay our efforts to collect past due balances under the relevant leases  and could ultimately preclude collection of these sums 
if a lease is assumed by the tenant in bankruptcy  all pre bankruptcy balances due under the lease must be paid to us in full 
however  if a lease is rejected by a tenant in bankruptcy  we would have only a general unsecured claim for damages 
any unsecured claim we hold may be paid only to the extent that funds are available and only in the same percentage as is paid to all other holders of unsecured claims  and there are restrictions under bankruptcy laws that limit the amount of the claim we can make if a lease is rejected 
as a result  it is likely that we will recover substantially less than the full value of any unsecured claims we hold from a bankrupt tenant 
the bankruptcy or financial difficulties of any of our tenants may negatively affect our operating results by decreasing our revenues 
risks associated with the property management  leasing and brokerage businesses could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing our revenues 
in addition to the risks we face as a result of our ownership of real estate  we face risks relating to the property management  leasing and brokerage businesses of cpsi  including risks that management contracts or service agreements with third party owners will be terminated and lost to competitors  contracts will not be renewed upon expiration or will not be available for renewal on terms consistent with current terms  and leasing and brokerage activity generally may decline 
each of these developments could adversely affect our results of operations by decreasing our revenues 
we could incur significant costs related to environmental issues which could adversely affect our results of operations through increased compliance costs or our financial condition if we become subject to a significant liability 
under federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  a current or previous owner or operator of real property  and parties that generate or transport hazardous substances that are disposed of on real property  may be liable for the costs of investigating and remediating hazardous substances on or under or released from the property and for damages to natural resources 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation liability act  and similar state laws  generally impose liability on a joint and several basis  regardless of whether the owner  operator or other responsible party knew of or was at fault for the release or presence of hazardous substances 
in connection with the ownership or operation of our properties  we could be liable in the future for costs associated with investigation and remediation of hazardous substances released at such properties 
the costs of any required remediation and related liability as to any property could be substantial under these laws and could exceed the value of the property and or our assets 
the presence of hazardous substances  or the failure to properly remediate those substances may result in our being liable for damages suffered by a third party and may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent a property or to borrow funds using the property as collateral 
in addition  environmental laws may impose restrictions on the manner in which we use our properties or operate our business  and these restrictions may require expenditures for compliance 
the restrictions themselves may change from time to time  and these changes may result in additional expenditures in order to achieve compliance 
we cannot assure you that a material environmental claim or compliance obligation will not arise in the future 
the costs of defending against any claims of liability  of remediating a contaminated property  or of complying with future environmental requirements could be substantial and affect our operating results 
in addition  if a judgment is obtained against us or we otherwise become subject to a significant environmental liability  our financial condition may be adversely affected 
on december   we acquired bel air mall in mobile  alabama 
during the course of our environmental due diligence  we identified several different areas of the property in which contamination is present 
one of those areas involves drycleaner solvent  the others involve petroleum contamination 
the alabama department of environmental management adem is overseeing the investigation and cleanup of the drycleaner contamination 
under the terms of the purchase and sale agreement  the former owner of the property purchased a million 
table of contents environmental insurance policy including paying the  up front deductible and established an escrow account totaling  to cover any costs associated with investigation and remediation of the contaminated areas not covered by the insurance policy 
under the agreement the seller performed all required remediation of the drycleaner contamination and received a no further action letter from adem 
in addition  the seller completed the remediation process for an out parcel at the bel air mall  previously occupied by an amoco gas station 
although we sold the bel air mall to the gpt joint venture  in which we retained a interest  we remain exposed to residual environmental liability in addition to our exposure as a current owner  as a previous owner 
costs associated with moisture infiltration and resulting mold remediation may be costly 
as a general matter  concern about indoor exposure to mold has been increasing as such exposure has been alleged to have a variety of adverse effects on health 
as a result  there has been a number of lawsuits in our industry against owners and managers of apartment communities relating to moisture infiltration and resulting mold 
the terms of our property and general liability policies generally exclude certain mold related claims 
should an uninsured loss arise against us  we would be required to use our funds to resolve the issue  including litigation costs 
we make no assurance that liabilities resulting from moisture infiltration and the presence of or exposure to mold will not have a future impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
uninsured or underinsured losses could adversely affect our financial condition 
as of december   we are self insured up to million  million and million for general liability  workers compensation and property insurance  respectively 
we are also self insured for health insurance and responsible for claims up to  per claim and up to million per person  according to plan policy limits 
if the actual costs incurred to cover such uninsured claims are significantly greater than our budgeted costs  our financial condition will be adversely affected 
we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance in amounts that we believe are in line with coverage customarily obtained by owners of similar properties and appropriate given the relative risk of loss and the cost of the coverage 
there are  however  certain types of losses  such as lease and other contract claims  acts of war or terrorism  acts of god  and in some cases  earthquakes  hurricanes and flooding that generally are not insured because such coverage is not available or it is not available at commercially reasonable rates 
should an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occur  we could lose all or a portion of the capital we have invested in the damaged property  as well as the anticipated future revenue from the property 
the costs associated with property and casualty renewals may be higher than anticipated 
we cannot predict at this time if in the future we will be able to obtain full coverage at a reasonable cost 
inflation  changes in building codes and ordinances  environmental considerations  and other factors also might make it impractical or undesirable to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed 
in addition  if the damaged properties are subject to recourse indebtedness  we would continue to be liable for the indebtedness  even if these properties were irreparably damaged 
competition for acquisitions could reduce the number of acquisition opportunities available to us and result in increased prices for properties  which could adversely affect our return on properties we purchase 
we compete with other major real estate investors with significant capital for attractive investment opportunities in multifamily  office and retail properties 
these competitors include publicly traded reits  private reits  domestic and foreign financial institutions  life insurance companies  pension trusts  trust funds  investment banking firms  private institutional investment funds and national  regional and local real estate investors 
the current market for acquisitions continues to be extremely competitive 
this competition could increase the demand for multifamily  office or retail properties  and therefore reduce the number of suitable acquisition opportunities available to us and increase the prices paid for such acquisition properties 
as a result  our expected return from investment in these properties would deteriorate 
we may be unable to successfully integrate and effectively manage the properties we acquire  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
so long as we are able to obtain capital on commercially reasonable terms  we intend to continue to selectively acquire multifamily  office and retail properties that meet our criteria for investment opportunities  are consistent with our business strategies and we believe will be profitable or will enhance the value of our portfolio  as a whole 

table of contents the success of these acquisitions will depend  in part  on our ability to efficiently integrate the acquired properties into our organization  and apply our business  operating  administrative  financial and accounting strategies and controls to these acquired properties 
as a result of the rapid growth of our portfolio  we cannot assure you that we will be able to adapt our management  administrative  accounting and operational systems or hire and retain sufficient operational staff to integrate these properties into our portfolio and manage any future acquisitions of additional properties without operating disruptions or unanticipated costs 
as we develop or acquire additional properties  we will be subject to risks associated with managing new properties  including tenant retention and mortgage default 
in addition  acquisitions or developments may cause disruptions in our operations and divert management s attention away from day to day operations  which could impair our relationships with our current tenants and employees 
in addition  our profitability may suffer because of acquisition related costs or amortization costs for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
if we are unable to successfully integrate the acquired properties into our operations  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
we may not be able to achieve the anticipated financial and operating results from our acquisitions  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we will continue to acquire multifamily  office or retail properties only if they meet our criteria and we believe that that they will enhance our future financial performance and the value of our portfolio 
our belief  however  is based on and is subject to risks  uncertainties and other factors  many of which are forward looking and are uncertain in nature or are beyond our control 
in addition  some of these properties may have unknown characteristics or deficiencies or may not complement our portfolio of existing properties 
as a result  some properties may be worth less or may generate less revenue than  or simply not perform as well as  we believed at the time of the acquisition  thereby negatively affecting our operating results 
we may be unable to develop new properties or redevelop existing properties successfully  which could adversely affect our results of operations due to unexpected costs  delays and other contingencies 
to complement our acquisition strategy  we will continue to develop new properties or expand or redevelop existing properties as opportunities arise 
however  there are significant risks associated with our development activities in addition to those generally associated with the ownership and operation of developed properties 
these risks include the following significant expenditure of money and time on projects that may be delayed or never be completed  higher than projected construction costs  lack of availability of debt or equity financing on acceptable terms  failure to meet anticipated occupancy or rent levels  failure to obtain zoning  occupancy or other governmental approvals  changes in applicable zoning and land use laws may require us to abandon projects prior to their completion  resulting in the loss of development costs incurred up to the time of abandonment  and late completion because of construction delays  delays in the receipt of zoning  occupancy and other approvals or other factors outside of our control 
in addition  if a project is delayed  certain tenants may have the right to terminate their leases 
any one or more of these risks may cause us to incur unexpected costs in connection with our development strategy  which would negatively affect our results of operations 
our joint venture investments could be adversely affected by our lack of sole decision making authority  our reliance on our joint venture partners financial condition  any disputes that may arise between us and our joint venture partners and our exposure to potential losses from the actions of our joint venture partners 
as of december   we had ownership interests in joint ventures and anticipate entering into additional joint venture arrangements as part of our strategy to change our asset mix to generate approximately of our net operating income from multifamily properties  compared to approximately as of december  
table of contents our investments in joint ventures involve risks not customarily associated with our wholly owned properties  including the following we share decision making authority with some of our joint venture partners regarding major decisions affecting the ownership or operation of the joint venture and the joint venture properties  such as the sale of the properties or the making of additional capital contributions for the benefit of the properties  which may prevent us from taking actions that are opposed by those joint venture partners  prior consent of our joint venture partners is required for a sale or transfer to a third party of our interests in the joint venture  which restricts our ability to dispose of our interest in the joint venture  our joint venture partners might become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions  which may delay construction or development of a joint venture property or increase our financial commitment to the joint venture  our joint venture partners may have business interests or goals with respect to the joint venture properties that conflict with our business interests and goals  which could increase the likelihood of disputes regarding the ownership  management or disposition of such properties  disputes may develop with our joint venture partners over decisions affecting the joint venture properties or the joint venture  which may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and distract our officers and or trustees from focusing their time and effort on our business  and possibly disrupt the day to day operations of the property such as by delaying the implementation of important decisions until the conflict or dispute is resolved  and we may suffer losses as a result of the actions of our joint venture partners with respect to our joint venture investments 
risks associated with our indebtedness and financing we have substantial indebtedness and our cash flow may not be sufficient to make required payments on our indebtedness or repay our indebtedness as it matures 
we rely on debt financing for our business 
as of december   the amount of our total debt was approximately billion  consisting of billion of consolidated debt and billion of our pro rata share of joint venture debt 
due to our high level of debt  we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our funds from operations to servicing our debt  and our cash flow may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest 
if a property were mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we were unable to meet mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose upon that property  appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies 
in addition  if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt 
most of our indebtedness does not require significant principal payments prior to maturity 
however  we will need to raise additional equity capital  obtain collateralized or unsecured debt financing  issue private or public debt  or sell some of our assets to either refinance or repay our indebtedness as it matures 
we cannot assure you that these sources of financing or refinancing will be available to us at reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to obtain financing or refinancing to repay our maturing indebtedness  and our inability to refinance existing indebtedness on reasonable terms  may require us to make higher interest and principal payments  issue additional equity securities  or sell some of our assets on disadvantageous terms  all or any of which may result in foreclosure of properties  partial or complete loss on our investment and otherwise adversely affect our financial conditions and results of operation 
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing which would negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition 
as of december   our consolidated borrowings and pro rata share of unconsolidated borrowings totaled approximately billion  which represented approximately of our total market capitalization 
total market capitalization represents the sum of the outstanding indebtedness including our share of joint venture indebtedness  
table of contents the total liquidation preference of all our preferred shares and the total market value of our common shares and units of partnership interest of our operating partnership  based on the closing price of our common shares as of december  our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the incurrence of debt 
our leverage and any future increases in our leverage could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes which would negatively impact our results of operation and financial condition 
due to the amount of our variable rate debt  rising interest rates would adversely affect our results of operation 
as of december   we had approximately million of variable rate debt outstanding  consisting of million of our consolidated debt and million of our pro rata share of variable rate unconsolidated joint venture debt 
while we have sought to refinance our variable rate debt with fixed rate debt or cap our exposure to interest rate fluctuations by using interest rate swap agreements where appropriate  failure to hedge effectively against interest rate changes may adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  as opportunities arise  we may borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future 
as a result  a significant increase in interest rates would adversely affect our results of operations 
we have entered into debt agreements with covenants that restrict our operating activities  which could adversely affect our results of operations  and violation of these restrictive covenants could adversely affect our financial condition through debt defaults or acceleration 
our credit facility contains numerous customary restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt  including restrictions related to collateralized debt to total asset value ratio  fixed charge coverage ratio  total liabilities to total asset value ratio  total permitted investments to total asset value ratio  and unencumbered leverage ratio 
in addition  the indenture under which our senior unsecured debt is issued contains financial and operating covenants including coverage ratios 
our indenture also limits our ability to incur collateralized and unsecured indebtedness  sell all or substantially all or our assets  and engage in mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
these restrictions will continue to hinder our operational flexibility through limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness  pursue certain business initiatives or make other changes to our business 
these limitations could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  violations of these covenants could cause the declaration of defaults and any related acceleration of indebtedness  which would result in adverse consequences to our financial condition 
our inability to obtain sufficient third party financing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition because we depend on third party financing for our development  expansion or acquisition activities 
to qualify as a reit  we must distribute to our shareholders each year at least of our reit taxable income  excluding any net capital gain 
because of these distribution requirements  it is not likely that we will be able to fund all future capital needs from income from operations 
as a result  as we continue to develop or acquire new properties or expand existing properties  we will continue to rely on third party sources of capital  including lines of credit  collateralized or unsecured debt both construction financing and permanent debt  and equity issuances 
these sources  however  may not be available on favorable terms or at all 
our access to third party sources of capital depends on a number of factors  including the market s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings 
moreover  additional equity offerings may result in substantial dilution of our shareholders interests  and additional debt financing may substantially increase our leverage 
there can be no 
table of contents assurance that we will be able to obtain the financing necessary to fund new development or project expansions or our acquisition activities on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient level of third party financing to fund our growth  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
our senior notes do not have an established trading market  therefore  holders of our notes may not be able to sell their notes 
each series of our senior notes is a new issue of securities with no established trading market 
we do not intend to apply for listing of any series of notes on any national securities exchange 
the underwriters in an offering of senior notes may advise us that they intend to make a market in the notes  but they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue market making at any time without notice 
we can give no assurance as to the liquidity of or any trading market for any series of our notes 
risks associated with our organization some of our trustees and officers have conflicts of interest and could exercise influence in a manner inconsistent with the interests of our shareholders 
as a result of their substantial ownership of common shares and units  messrs 
thomas lowder  our chairman of the board  james lowder and harold ripps  each of whom is a trustee  could seek to exert influence over our decisions as to sales or re financings of particular properties we own 
any such exercise of influence could produce decisions that are not in the best interest of all of the holders of interests in us 
the lowder family and their affiliates hold interests in a company that has performed insurance brokerage services with respect to our properties 
this company may perform similar services for us in the future 
as a result  the lowder family may realize benefits from transactions between this company and us that are not realized by other holders of interests in us 
in addition  thomas and james lowder  as our trustees  may be in a position to influence us to do business with companies in which the lowder family has a financial interest 
our policies may not be successful in eliminating the influence of conflicts 
moreover  transactions with companies controlled by the lowder family  if any  may not be on terms as favorable to us as we could obtain in an arms length transaction with a third party 
restrictions on the acquisition and change in control of the company may have adverse effects on the value of our common shares 
various provisions of our declaration of trust restrict the possibility for acquisition or change in control of us  even if the acquisition or change in control were in the shareholders interest 
as a result  the value of our common shares may be less than they would otherwise be in the absence of such restrictions 
our declaration of trust contains ownership limits and restrictions on transferability 
our declaration of trust contains certain restrictions on the number of common shares and preferred shares that individual shareholders may own  which is intended to ensure that we maintain our qualification as a reit 
in order for us to qualify as a reit  no more than of the value of our outstanding shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the code to include certain entities during the last half of a taxable year and the shares must be beneficially owned by or more persons during at least days of a taxable year of months or during a proportionate part of a shorter taxable year 
to help avoid violating these requirements  our declaration of trust contains provisions restricting the ownership and transfer of shares in certain circumstances 
these ownership limitations provide that no person may beneficially own  or be deemed to own by virtue of the attribution provisions of the code  more than  in either number of shares or value whichever is more restrictive  of any class of our outstanding shares  in number or value whichever is more restrictive  of our outstanding common shares and any outstanding excess shares  and in the case of certain excluded holders related to the lowder family by one individual  by two individuals  by three individuals  or by four individuals 

table of contents these ownership limitations may be waived by our board of trustees if it receives representations and undertakings of certain facts for the protection of our reit status  and if requested  an irs ruling or opinion of counsel 
our declaration of trust permits our board of trustees to issue preferred shares with terms that may discourage a third party from acquiring us 
our declaration of trust permits the board of trustees to issue up to  preferred shares  having those preferences  conversion or other rights  voting powers  restrictions  limitations as to distributions  qualifications  or terms or conditions of redemption as determined by the board of trustees 
thus  the board of trustees could authorize the issuance of preferred shares with terms and conditions that could have the effect of discouraging a takeover or other transaction in which some or a majority of shares might receive a premium for their shares over the then prevailing market price of shares 
our declaration of trust and bylaws contain other possible anti takeover provisions 
our declaration of trust and bylaws contain other provisions that may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing an acquisition or change in control of the company  and  as a result could prevent our shareholders from being paid a premium for their common shares over the then prevailing market prices 
these provisions include a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent  the ability to remove trustees only at a meeting of shareholders called for that purpose  by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than two thirds of the shares then outstanding and entitled to vote in the election of trustees  the limitation that a special meeting of shareholders can be called only by the president or chairman of the board or upon the written request of shareholders holding outstanding shares representing at least of all votes entitled to be cast at the special meeting  the advance written notice requirement for shareholders to nominate a trustee before a meeting of shareholders  and the requirement that the amendment of certain provisions of the declaration of trust relating to the removal of trustees  the termination of the company and any provision that would have the effect of amending these provisions  require the affirmative vote of the holders of two thirds of the shares then outstanding 
our board of directors has adopted a shareholder rights plan that could discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us 
our board of trustees has adopted a shareholder rights plan  which may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us 
under the plan  preferred purchase rights  which are attached to our common shares  generally will be triggered upon the acquisition of or more of our outstanding common shares  unless the rights are redeemed or exchanged 
if triggered  these rights would entitle our shareholders other than the acquirer to purchase  th of a colonial series preferred share at a price of  subject to adjustment 
the plan expires by its terms on november  we may change our business policies in the future  which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
our major policies  including our policies with respect to development  acquisitions  financing  growth  operations  debt capitalization and distributions  are determined by our board of trustees 
although it has no present intention to do so  our board of trustees may amend or revise these and other policies from time to time 
a change in these policies could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations  including our ability to service debt 
risks related to our shares market interest rates and low trading volume may have an adverse effect on the market value of our common shares 
the market price of shares of a reit may be affected by the distribution rate on those shares  as a percentage of the price of the shares  relative to market interest rates 
if market interest rates increase  prospective purchasers of our shares may expect a higher annual distribution rate 
higher interest rates would not  however  result in more 
table of contents funds for us to distribute and  in fact  would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution 
this could cause the market price of our common shares to go down 
in addition  although our common shares are listed on the new york stock exchange  the daily trading volume of our shares may be lower than the trading volume for other industries 
as a result  our investors who desire to liquidate substantial holdings may find that they are unable to dispose of their shares in the market without causing a substantial decline in the market value of the shares 
a large number of shares available for future sale could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
the sales of a substantial number of common shares  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing market prices for shares 
in addition to the possibility that we may sell our shares in a public offering at any time  or pursuant to share option and share purchase plans  as of december  we may issue up to  common shares upon redemption of currently outstanding units 
no prediction can be made about the effect that future sales of common shares will have on the market price of our common shares 
changes in market conditions or a failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to our earnings and cash distributions could adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
we believe that the market value of a reit s equity securities is based primarily upon the market s perception of the reit s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions  and is secondarily based upon the real estate market value of the underlying assets 
for that reason  our shares may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share 
to the extent we retain operating cash flow for investment purposes  working capital reserves or other purposes  these retained funds  while increasing the value of our underlying assets  may not correspondingly increase the market price of our common shares 
in addition  we are subject to the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet the required payments on our preferred shares and the operating partnership s preferred units 
our failure to meet the market s expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of our shares 
the stock markets  including the new york stock exchange nyse  on which we list our common shares  have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations 
as a result  the market price of our common shares could be similarly volatile  and investors in our common shares may experience a decrease in the value of their shares  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
among the market conditions that may affect the market price of our publicly traded securities are the following our financial condition and operating performance and the performance of other similar companies  actual or anticipated differences in our quarterly operating results  changes in our revenues or earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  publication of research reports about us or our industry by securities analysts  additions and departures of key personnel  strategic decisions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions  divestments  spin offs  joint ventures  strategic investments or changes in business strategy  the reputation of reits generally and the reputation of reits with portfolios similar to ours  the attractiveness of the securities of reits in comparison to securities issued by other entities including securities issued by other real estate companies  an increase in market interest rates  which may lead prospective investors to demand a higher distribution rate in relation to the price paid for our shares  the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that adversely affect us or our industry  speculation in the press or investment community  actions by institutional shareholders or hedge funds  changes in accounting principles  terrorist acts  and 
table of contents general market conditions  including factors unrelated to our performance 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our management s attention and resources 
risks associated with income tax laws our failure to qualify as a reit would decrease the funds available for distribution to our shareholders and adversely affect the market price of our common shares 
we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes commencing with our taxable year ended december  we intend to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit  but we cannot assure shareholders that we will qualify as a reit 
we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs that we qualify as a reit  and the statements in this form k are not binding on the irs or any court 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on our income that we distribute currently to our shareholders 
many of the reit requirements are highly technical and complex 
the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters and circumstances that may not be totally within our control 
for example  to qualify as a reit  at least of our gross income must come from sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws 
we generally are prohibited from owning more than of the voting securities or more than of the value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer  subject to certain exceptions  including an exception with respect to certain debt instruments and corporations electing to be taxable reit subsidiaries 
we are also required to distribute to shareholders at least of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
the fact that we hold most of our assets through the operating partnership further complicates the application of the reit requirements 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status 
furthermore  congress or the internal revenue service might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  or the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult  or impossible  for us to remain qualified as a reit 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  and are unable to avail ourselves of certain savings provisions set forth in the internal revenue code  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
as a taxable corporation  we would not be allowed to take a deduction for distributions to shareholders in computing our taxable income or pass through long term capital gains to individual shareholders at favorable rates 
we also could be subject to the federal alternative minimum tax and possibly increased state and local taxes 
we would not be able to elect to be taxed as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify unless the irs were to grant us relief under certain statutory provisions 
if we failed to qualify as a reit  we would have to pay significant income taxes  which would reduce our net earnings available for investment or distribution to our shareholders 
this likely would have a significant adverse effect on our earnings and the value of our common shares 
in addition  we would no longer be required to pay any distributions to shareholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes and are able to avail ourselves of one or more of the statutory savings provisions in order to maintain our reit status  we would nevertheless be required to pay penalty taxes of  or more for each such failure 
even if we qualify as a reit  we will be required to pay some taxes 
even if we qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we will be required to pay certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
for example  we will be subject to income tax to the extent we distribute less than of our reit taxable income including capital gains 
moreover  if we have net income from prohibited transactions  that income will be subject to a tax 
in general  prohibited transactions are sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business 
the determination as to whether a particular sale is a prohibited transaction depends on the facts and circumstances related to that sale 
however  we will not be treated as a dealer in real property with respect to a property that we sell for the purposes of the tax if i we have held the property for at least four years for the production of rental income prior to the sale  ii capitalized expenditures on the property in the four years preceding the sale are less than of the net selling price of the property  and iii we either a have seven or fewer sales of property excluding certain property obtained through foreclosure for the year of sale or b the aggregate tax basis of property sold during the year of sale is or less of the aggregate tax basis of all of our assets as of the beginning of the taxable year and substantially all of the marketing and development expenditures with respect to the property 
table of contents sold are made through an independent contractor from whom we derive no income 
the sale of more than one property to one buyer as part of one transaction constitutes one sale for purposes of this safe harbor 
we intend to hold our properties  and crlp intends to hold its properties  for investment with a view to long term appreciation  to engage in the business of acquiring  developing  owning and operating properties  and to make occasional sales of properties as are consistent with our investment objectives 
however  not all of our sales will satisfy the safe harbor requirements described above 
furthermore  there are certain interpretive issues related to the application of the safe harbor that are not free from doubt under the federal income tax law 
while we acquire and hold our properties with an investment objective and do not believe they constitute dealer property  we cannot provide any assurance that the irs might not contend that one or more of these sales are subject to the penalty tax or that the irs would not challenge our interpretation of  or any reliance on  the safe harbor provisions 
in addition  any net taxable income earned directly by our taxable reit subsidiaries  or through entities that are disregarded for federal income tax purposes as entities separate from our taxable reit subsidiaries  will be subject to federal and possibly state corporate income tax 
we have elected to treat colonial properties services  inc as a taxable reit subsidiary  and we may elect to treat other subsidiaries as taxable reit subsidiaries in the future 
in this regard  several provisions of the laws applicable to reits and their subsidiaries ensure that a taxable reit subsidiary will be subject to an appropriate level of federal income taxation 
for example  a taxable reit subsidiary is limited in its ability to deduct interest payments made to an affiliated reit 
in addition  the reit has to pay a penalty tax on some payments that it receives or on some deductions taken by the taxable reit subsidiaries if the economic arrangements between the reit  the reit s tenants  and the taxable reit subsidiary are not comparable to similar arrangements between unrelated parties 
finally  some state and local jurisdictions may tax some of our income even though as a reit we are not subject to federal income tax on that income because not all states and localities treat reits the same as they are treated for federal income tax purposes 
to the extent that we and our affiliates are required to pay federal  state and local taxes  we will have less cash available for distributions to our shareholders

adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures are calculated to reflect ffo on the same basis 
the company believes that ffo is useful to investors because it provides an additional indicator of the company s financial and operating performance 
this is because  by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and gains or losses from sales of properties all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparison of operating performance among equity reits 
ffo is a widely recognized measure in the company s industry

general we are a self administered equity reit that owns  develops and operates multifamily  office and retail properties in the sunbelt region of the united states 
we are a fully integrated real estate company  which means that we are engaged in the acquisition  development  ownership  management and leasing of commercial real estate property 
our activities include full or partial ownership of a diversified portfolio of properties  including lease ups  as of december   located in alabama  arizona  california  florida  georgia  maryland  mississippi  north carolina  south carolina  tennessee  texas  and virginia  development of new operating properties and for sale properties  acquisition of existing properties  build to suit development  and the provision of management  leasing  and brokerage services for commercial real estate 
as a lessor  the majority of our revenue is derived from tenants under existing leases at our properties 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent upon the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants  and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
the following table summarizes certain key operating performance measures for our consolidated properties as of and for the years ended december  and as of and for the year ended december  multifamily properties physical occupancy same property economic occupancy end of month effective rent per unit per month capital expenditures per unit office properties physical occupancy base rent per square foot capital expenditures per square foot retail properties physical occupancy base rent per square foot tenant gross sales per square foot economic occupancy represents scheduled base rents  less vacancy loss  all concessions adjusted for straight line including but not limited to renewals  move ins  models  employee units  and bad debts divided by scheduled base rents 
retail property base rent per square foot excludes anchor tenants and tenants with a leasable area greater than  square feet 
tenant gross sales per square foot are for mall properties only and excludes tenants with a leasable area greater than  square feet 

table of contents as shown in the table above  multifamily occupancy rates increased slightly in however  effective rents per unit increased significantly as multifamily fundamentals continued to strengthen 
growth in effective rents was also impacted by our asset recycling program through which we sold properties in slower growth markets and acquired properties in higher growth markets  such as atlanta  austin  charlotte  and dallas 
capital expenditures per unit increased during due to the timing of improvements made to older properties acquired in the cornerstone merger 
we expect to continue to invest in quality multifamily properties in high growth markets 
as a result of the anticipated change in our asset mix discussed below  we expect to continue to have greater exposure to the economic trends specific to the multifamily sector  such as changes in job growth  household formation and population growth in our markets  changes in interest rates  supply and demand for apartment properties in our current markets  and competition  which could limit our ability to secure attractive investment opportunities  lease apartment properties  or increase or maintain rents 
as shown in the table above  physical occupancy of our office properties increased from in to in the increase is primarily due to leasing activity at the properties acquired during same store occupancy decreased slightly from in to in average rental rates increased in by to per square foot from per square foot in the increase is due to higher rental rates in tampa  orlando  birmingham and atlanta 
lease transactions of million square feet were completed for the consolidated portfolio in  including  square feet of new leases 
average tenant improvements and leasing commissions have increased from this is primarily a result of several large  long term transactions in our higher rental rate locations 
during  our retail division opened a new shopping center development which is leased as of december  we sold outright two shopping centers  one being a new shopping center development that opened in we also sold four shopping centers into a joint venture in which we initially retained a interest and then later in the year sold the remaining interest in those properties 
these transactions triggered the shifts in the base rent per square foot indicators above due to the fact that the properties sold averaged higher rents per square foot 
with the strong leasing activity in both anchor and specialty tenant space representing a total of million square feet of transactions  the occupancy of our consolidated properties increased significantly during to from at the end of additionally  our retention rate on renewals during was 
our consolidated mall sales per square foot grew over the previous year 
with properties slated to be sold and others to be transferred to joint ventures in which we will maintain a minority interest in  we believe our operating metrics will continue to reflect changes in our portfolio mix 
we are also currently developing eight shopping centers  which we expect upon completion will total approximately million square feet of retail space  as part of our focus on expanding our portfolio in lifestyle and power centers as well as mixed use developments 
generally  the developments will be slated as merchant build to be sold upon stabilization outright or to a joint venture in which we would retain a minority interest 
our business strategy and the implementation of that strategy are determined by our board of trustees and may change from time to time 
our current strategy has been to change our asset mix to generate approximately of our net operating income from multifamily properties  compared to approximately as of december  in november  we announced the acceleration of our plan to focus on the multifamily business 
to implement this strategy  over the next six to months  we plan to sell the majority of our wholly owned office assets and retail assets into a series of joint ventures in which we would retain a minority interest  and which we expect to manage 
in addition  other retail assets are expected to be sold outright 
we currently estimate that once the anticipated joint venture and asset sale transactions are complete  annualized net operating income from multifamily operations would be approximately of our total net operating income 
while there will be less capital allocated to the commercial businesses  we currently expect to retain our development  leasing and management expertise 
we expect to continue our emphasis on value creation through development of multifamily  office  mixed use and open air shopping center properties 
furthermore  we expect to continue to take advantage of our expertise in the commercial markets by focusing on development and opportunistic value creation  including mixed use projects 
it is currently anticipated that the proceeds from any joint venture and 
table of contents asset sale transactions would be used to reduce our leverage and make a special distribution to the holders of common shares  however  any such distribution would be subject to approval by the board of trustees 
at this point  we are in the process of identifying joint venture partners and buyers for the commercial assets to be sold

summary of critical accounting policies we believe our accounting policies are in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
we consider the following accounting policies to be critical to our reported operating results principles of consolidation we consolidate entities in which we have a controlling interest or entities where we are determined to be the primary beneficiary under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
under fin r  variable interest entities vies are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the vie for financial reporting purposes 
additionally  emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partner as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights provides guidance 
table of contents in determining whether a general partner controls and therefore should consolidate a limited partnership 
the application of fin r and eitf no 
 requires us to make significant estimates and judgments about our and our other partners rights  obligations and economic interests in such entities 
for entities in which we have less than a controlling financial interest or entities where we are not the primary beneficiary under fin r  the entities are accounted for on the equity method of accounting 
accordingly  our share of the net earnings or losses of these entities is included in consolidated net income 
a description of our investments accounted for on the equity method of accounting is included in note investments in partially owned entities and other arrangements in our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
we eliminate all significant intercompany accounts and transactions in consolidation 
we recognize minority interest in our consolidated balance sheets for non wholly owned entities that we consolidate 
the minority partners share of current operations is reflected in minority interest of limited partners in the consolidated statements of income 
land  buildings  and equipment land  buildings  and equipment is stated at the lower of cost  less accumulated depreciation  or fair value 
we review our long lived assets and certain intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if an asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the asset s fair value 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  as follows useful lives buildings years furniture and fixtures or years equipment or years land improvements or years tenant improvements life of lease repairs and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred 
replacements and improvements are capitalized and depreciated over the estimated remaining useful lives of the assets 
when items of land  buildings  or equipment are sold or retired  the related costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we recognize sales of real estate properties only upon the closing of a transaction 
payments received from purchasers prior to closing are recorded as deposits 
profit on real estate sold is recognized using the full accrual method upon closing when the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured and we are not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale 
profit may be deferred in whole or part until the sale meets the requirements of profit recognition on sales of real estate under sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
for properties sold to a joint venture in which we retain an ownership percentage  we limit the profit recognized from the sale to the portion sold to the outside party 
further  the profit is limited by the amount of cash received for which we have no commitment to reinvest pursuant to the partial sale provisions found in paragraph of statement of position sop as of december   in accordance with sfas no 
 all sales of real estate properties have been recorded as sales transactions  as the risk and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the purchaser 
for condominium conversion projects  sales and the associated gains for individual condominium units are recognized upon the closing of the sale transactions  as all conditions for full profit recognition have been met 
estimated future warranty costs are charged to cost of sales in the period when the revenues from condominium closings are recognized 
such estimated warranty costs generally are approximately of total revenue 
as necessary  additional warranty costs are charged to costs of sales based on management s estimate of the costs to remediate existing claims 
acquisition of real estate assets we account for our acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires the fair value of the real estate acquired to be allocated to the acquired tangible assets  consisting of land  building and tenant improvements  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases  other value of 
table of contents in place leases and value of other tenant relationships  based in each case on their fair values 
we consider acquisitions of operating real estate assets to be businesses as that term is contemplated in emerging issues task force issue no 
 determining whether a non monetary transaction involves receipt of productive assets or of a business 
we allocate purchase price to the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes the land and building determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant 
the as if vacant value is allocated to land and buildings based on management s determination of the relative fair values of these assets 
we also allocate value to tenant improvements based on the estimated costs of similar tenants with similar terms 
above market and below market in place lease values for acquired properties are recorded based on the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the in place leases and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for the corresponding in place leases  measured over a period equal to the remaining non cancelable term of the lease 
the capitalized above market lease values are amortized as a reduction of rental income over the remaining non cancelable terms of the respective leases 
the capitalized below market lease values are amortized as an increase to rental income over the initial term and any fixed rate renewal periods in the respective leases 
the aggregate value of other intangible assets acquired are measured based on the difference between i the property valued with existing in place leases adjusted to market rental rates and ii the property valued as if vacant 
management may engage independent third party appraisers to perform these valuations and those appraisals use commonly employed valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow analyses 
factors considered in these analyses include an estimate of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
we also consider information obtained about each property as a result of our pre acquisition due diligence  marketing and leasing activities in estimating the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets acquired 
in estimating carrying costs  management also includes real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods depending on specific local market conditions and depending on the type of property acquired 
management also estimates costs to execute similar leases including leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses to the extent that such costs are not already incurred in connection with a new lease origination as part of the transaction 
the total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in place leases  which includes other tenant relationship intangible values based on management s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant 
characteristics considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant  growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant  the tenant s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals including those existing under the terms of the lease agreement or management s expectation for renewal  among other factors 
we are actively pursuing acquisition opportunities and will not be successful in all cases 
costs incurred related to these acquisition opportunities are expensed when it is no longer probable that we will be successful in the acquisition 
undeveloped land and construction in progress undeveloped land and construction in progress is stated at the lower of cost or fair value 
costs incurred during predevelopment are capitalized after we have identified a development site  determined that a project is feasible  and concluded that it is probable that the project will proceed 
while we believe we will recover this capital through the successful development of such projects  it is possible that a write off of unrecoverable amounts could occur 
once it is no longer probable that a development will be successful  the predevelopment costs that have been previously capitalized are expensed 
the capitalization of costs during the development of assets including interest  property taxes and other direct costs begins when an active development commences and ends when the asset  or a portion of an asset  is delivered and is ready for its intended use 
cost capitalization during redevelopment of assets including interest and other direct costs begins when the asset is taken out of service for redevelopment and ends when the asset redevelopment is completed and the asset is placed in service 

table of contents valuation of receivables we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies at our office and retail properties that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  we perform credit review and analysis on all commercial tenants and significant leases before they are executed 
we evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables and record allowances as appropriate 
our policy is to record allowances for all outstanding invoices greater than days past due at our office and retail properties 
we had million and million in an allowance for doubtful accounts as of december  and  respectively 
due to the short term nature of the leases at our multifamily properties  generally six months to one year  our exposure to tenant defaults and bankruptcies is minimized 
our policy is to record allowances for all outstanding receivables greater than days past due at our multifamily properties 
notes receivable notes receivable consists primarily of promissory notes issued by third parties 
the company records notes receivable at cost 
the company evaluates the collectibility of both interest and principal for each of its notes to determine whether it is impaired 
a note is considered to be impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the existing contractual terms 
when a note is considered to be impaired  the amount of the allowance is calculated by comparing the recorded investment to either the value determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at the note s effective interest rate or to the fair value of the collateral if the note is collateral dependent 
the company had recorded accrued interest related to its outstanding notes receivable of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
as of december   we had recorded a reserve of million against our outstanding notes receivable and accrued interest 
the weighted average interest rate on the notes receivable outstanding at december  and was approximately and respectively 
interest income is recognized on an accrual basis 
derivative instruments all derivative instruments are recognized on the balance sheet and measured at fair value 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge treatment under sfas no 
subsequently amended by sfas nos 
and  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  must be recorded at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we enter into derivative financial instruments from time to time  but do not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate cap agreements and interest rate swap agreements are used to reduce the potential impact of increases in interest rates on variable rate debt 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction  the nature of the risk being hedged and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness in hedging the exposure to the hedged transaction s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk will be assessed 
both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  we assess whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items 
we discontinue hedge accounting if a derivative is not determined to be highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge 
share based compensation we currently sponsor share option plans and restricted share award plans refer to note share based compensation in our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k

under this method  the fair value of compensation expense was recorded for all share based awards granted or modified after january  accordingly  the adoption of sfas no 
r did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we  as lessor  retain substantially all the risks and benefits of property ownership and account for our leases as operating leases 
rental income attributable to leases is recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the leases 
certain leases contain provisions for additional rent based on a percentage of tenant sales 
percentage rents are recognized in the period in which sales thresholds are met 
recoveries from tenants for taxes  insurance  and other property operating expenses are recognized in the period the applicable costs are incurred in accordance with the terms of the related lease 

table of contents revenue from construction contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date to estimated total costs 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
adjustments to estimated profits on contracts are recognized in the period in which such adjustments become known 
other income received from long term contracts signed in the normal course of business  including property management and development fee income  is recognized when earned for services provided to third parties 
segment reporting we have adopted sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
sfas no 
defines an operating segment as a component of an enterprise that engages in business activities that generate revenues and incur expenses  which operating results are reviewed by the chief operating decision maker in the determination of resource allocation and performance  and for which discrete financial information is available 
we are organized into and manage our business based on the performance of three separate and distinct operating divisions multifamily  office and retail

to implement this strategy  over the next six to months  we plan to sell the majority of our wholly owned office assets and retail assets into a series of joint ventures 
in addition  other retail assets are expected to be sold outright 
capital proceeds from these transactions are expected to be used to reduce mortgage debt and pay a special dividend to our shareholders 
these transactions are not expected to materially impact our debt to equity ratios 
we also anticipate maintaining our investment grade rating  and as such  do not expect capital availability to be materially impacted as a result of the transactions 
short term liquidity needs our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses directly associated with our portfolio of properties including regular maintenance items  capital expenditures incurred to lease our space eg  tenant improvements and leasing commissions  scheduled principal payments and interest expense on our outstanding debt  and quarterly dividends and distributions paid to our common and preferred shareholders and holders of partnership units in crlp 
in the past  we have primarily satisfied these requirements through cash generated from operations 
we believe that cash generated from operations and borrowings under our unsecured line of credit will be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements 
however  factors described below and elsewhere herein  including under item a risk factors  may have a material adverse effect on our cash flow 
the majority of our revenue is derived from tenants under existing leases at our properties 
therefore  our operating cash flow is dependent upon the rents that we are able to charge to our tenants and the ability of these tenants to make their rental payments 
we have made an election to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  commencing with our taxable year ending december  if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax to the extent we distribute at least of our reit taxable income to our shareholders 
even if we qualify for taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and property and to federal income and excise taxes on our undistributed income 
long term liquidity needs our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for the principal amount of our long term debt as it matures  significant non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically at our properties  development projects that we undertake and costs associated with acquisitions of properties that we pursue 
historically  we have satisfied these requirements principally through the most advantageous source of capital then available  which has included the incurrence of new debt through borrowings ie  public offerings of unsecured debt and private incurrence of collateralized and unsecured debt  sales of common and preferred shares  capital raised through the disposition of assets  and joint venture capital transactions 
we believe these sources of capital will continue to be available in the future to fund our long term capital needs 
however  factors described below and elsewhere herein may have a material adverse effect on our access to these capital sources in the future 
our ability to incur additional debt is dependent upon a number of factors  including our credit ratings  the value of our unencumbered assets  our degree of leverage and borrowing restrictions imposed by our current lenders 
we currently have investment grade ratings for prospective unsecured debt offerings from three major rating 
table of contents agencies 
if we experienced a credit downgrade  we may be limited in our access to capital in the unsecured debt market  which we have historically utilized to fund investment activities  and the interest rate we are paying under our existing credit facility would increase  if at all 
our ability to raise funds through sales of common shares and preferred shares is dependent on  among other things  general market conditions for reits  market perceptions about our company and the current trading price of our shares 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but the equity markets may not be consistently available on terms that are attractive 
as part of our on going strategy  we have maintained our asset recycling program  through which we sell assets that we believe have reached their maximum investment potential and reinvest the proceeds from the sale of these assets into opportunities that we believe have more growth potential 
during  we disposed of wholly owned multifamily apartment communities and our percentage interest in multifamily apartment communities representing  units  seven wholly owned office properties  including three that were sold to a joint venture  and our percentage interest in six office properties representing million square feet and six retail properties  representing million square feet 
the multifamily apartment communities  office properties and retail properties were sold for a total sales price of approximately billion  which was used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and to fund other investment activities 
we also sold condominium units at our five condominium conversion properties during for a total sales price of million 
our ability to generate cash from asset sales is limited by market conditions and certain rules applicable to reits 
our ability to sell properties may be limited in the future by the condition of the markets in which we operate and by various other regulatory requirements 
additionally  throughout  we sold various parcels of land located adjacent to our existing properties for an aggregate sales price of approximately million  which was also used to repay a portion of the borrowings under our unsecured line of credit and to support our investment activities 
as of december   we had approximately million of cash from the sales of assets  which we used to fund the acquisition of properties during the first quarter of as of december   we have unsecured credit facilities providing for total borrowings of up to million and a cash management line that provides for borrowings up to million 
these credit facilities bear interest at libor plus a spread calculated based on our unsecured debt ratings from time to time 
of the million available under the credit facilities  we have fixed million at an interest rate of with an interest rate swap agreement 
based on our december  debt ratings  the spread is basis points over libor 
the credit facilities  excluding the cash management line of credit  mature and are renewable in march and provide for a one year extension 
the credit facilities include a competitive bid feature that allows us to convert up to million under the credit facilities to a fixed rate  for a fixed term not to exceed days 
the credit facilities  which are primarily used to finance property acquisitions and developments  had an outstanding balance at december  of million 
there were no amounts outstanding on the cash management line at december  the interest rate of this short term borrowing facility  including the competitive bid balance  is and at december  and  respectively 
at december   our total outstanding debt balance was billion 
the outstanding balance includes fixed rate debt of billion  or of the total debt balance  and floating rate debt of million  or of the total debt balance 
our total market capitalization as of december  was billion and our ratio of debt to market capitalization was 
we have certain loan agreements that contain restrictive covenants  which among other things require maintenance of various financial ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants

during  we provided subordinated financing of million to partially owned joint ventures 
these loans are collateralized by the equity of the joint ventures 
with the exception of one million year amortizing loan  the loans have two to three year maturities 
we regularly incur significant expenditures in connection with the re leasing of our office and retail space  principally in the form of tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the amounts of these expenditures can vary significantly  depending on the particular market and the negotiations with tenants 
we also incur expenditures for certain recurring capital expenses 
during  we incurred approximately million related to tenant improvements and leasing commissions  and approximately million of recurring capital expenditures 
we expect to pay for future re leasing and recurring capital expenditures out of cash from operations 
dividend the dividend on our common share was per share per quarter or per share annually in we also pay regular quarterly dividends on our preferred shares and units 
the maintenance of these dividends is subject to various factors  including the discretion of our board of trustees  our ability to pay dividends under alabama law  the availability of cash to make the necessary dividend payments and the effect of reit distribution requirements  which require at least of our taxable income to be distributed to shareholders 
we also make regular quarterly distributions on units in our operating partnership 
financing transactions on july   we repaid our million unsecured senior notes  which matured on that date 
the notes were repaid with borrowings from our unsecured line of credit

in addition  as previously discussed  our spread on our million unsecured line of credit would increase 

table of contents market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to the effect of interest rate changes that could affect our results of operations and financial condition or cash flow 
we limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures  including the use of derivative instruments to manage or hedge interest rate risk 
the table below presents the principal amounts  weighted average interest rates  fair values and other terms required by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes at december  estimated thereafter total fair value amounts in thousands fixed rate debt average interest rate at december  variable debt average interest rate at december  the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december  it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates 
our objective in using derivatives is to add stability to interest expense and to manage our exposure to interest rate movements or other identified risks 
to accomplish this objective  we primarily use interest rate swaps including forward starting interest rate swaps and caps as part of our cash flow hedging strategy 
interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable rate amounts in exchange for fixed rate payments over the life of the agreements without exchange of the underlying principal amount 
during  such derivatives were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with existing variable rate debt and forecasted issuances of debt 
as of december   none of our outstanding interest rate swaps hedge the interest rate risk associated with forecasted debt issuances 
at december  and  derivatives with a fair value of million and million  respectively  were included in other assets 
the change in net unrealized gains losses of million in  million in and million in for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges is separately disclosed in the statements of changes in shareholders equity and comprehensive income 
the change in fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges of million  million and million is included in other income expense in  and  respectively 
hedge ineffectiveness of million and million on cash flow hedges due to index mismatches was recognized in other income during and  respectively 
as of december   all of our hedges are designated as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
amounts reported in accumulated other comprehensive income related to derivatives will be reclassified to interest expense as interest payments are made on our hedged debt 
the change in net unrealized gains on cash flow hedges reflects a reclassification of million  million and million of net unrealized gains from accumulated other comprehensive income to interest expense during  and  respectively 
we estimate no impact to interest expense for amounts that will be reclassified from other comprehensive income during during february  we settled a million forward starting interest rate swap and received a payment of approximately million 
this forward starting interest rate swap was in place to convert the floating rate payments on certain expected future debt obligations to a fixed rate 
this derivative originally qualified for hedge accounting under sfas no 
however  in december of as a result of a modification to the forecasted transaction  this derivative no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
as a result  we began treating this derivative as an economic hedge during changes in the fair value of this derivative were recognized in earnings in other income expense and totaled approximately million for the period of time the derivative was active during the fair value of this derivative at the time it no longer qualified for hedge accounting was approximately million  which will remain in accumulated other comprehensive income and be reclassified to interest expense over the applicable period of the associated debt  which is approximately years at december  
table of contents during june  we entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement to hedge the interest rate risk associated with a forecasted debt issuance that occurred on august  this interest rate swap agreement had a notional amount of million  a fixed interest rate of  and a maturity date of november  this interest rate swap agreement was settled concurrent with our issuance of million of debt in the senior notes offering completed august  see note notes and mortgages payable in our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
the settlement resulted in a settlement payment of approximately million by us 
this amount will remain in other comprehensive income and be reclassified to interest expense over the remaining term of the associated debt  which is approximately years at december  on august   we also entered into a million treasury lock agreement to hedge the interest rate risk associated with the remaining million of senior notes issued on august  this treasury lock agreement was settled on august  for a settlement payment of approximately million which will also remain in other comprehensive income and be reclassified to interest expense over the remaining life of the associated debt 
during november  we settled a million forward starting interest rate swap that was entered into in july of and received a payment of approximately million 
this forward starting interest rate swap was in place to convert the floating rate payments on certain expected future debt obligations to a fixed rate 
in november  we settled this forward starting swap agreement as a result of our determination that the forecasted debt issuance was no longer probable due to our strategic shift see note organization and basis of presentation in our notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item of this form k 
in december  we made the determination that it was probable that the forecasted debt issuance would not occur 
as a result  we reversed the million in other comprehensive income to other income during december of further  we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  we have not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor do we anticipate any material adverse effect on our net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives

during december  we sold of our interest in colonial promenade hoover for a total sales price of million to a newly formed joint venture  highway llc  in which we maintain a ownership interest and manage the property 
in connection with the formation of highway llc  we executed a guarantee  pursuant to which we would serve as a guarantor of million of the debt related to the joint venture  which is collateralized by the colonial promenade hoover retail property 
our maximum guarantee of million may be requested by the lender only after all of the rights and remedies available under the associated note and security agreements have been exercised and exhausted 
at december   the total amount of debt of the joint venture was approximately million and matures in december as of december   no liability was recorded for the guarantee

in connection with the acquisition of crt with dra  crlp guaranteed approximately million of third party financing obtained by the dra colonial office jv with respect to ten of the crt properties 
during  seven of the ten properties were sold 
the dra colonial office jv is obligated to reimburse crlp for any payments made under the guaranty before making distributions of cash flows or capital proceeds to the dra colonial office joint venture partners 
as of december   no liability was recorded for the guarantee 
as of february  this guarantee had been reduced to million as a result of the paydown of the associated secured debt from the sales of assets 
off balance sheet arrangements as listed above  at december   our share of mortgage debt of unconsolidated joint ventures is million 
we do not have any other off balance sheet arrangements with any unconsolidated investments or joint ventures that we believe have or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
the execution of our current strategy to change our mix of assets may result in a significant increase in unconsolidated third party mortgage indebtedness  which could also negatively impact our results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
see risk factors risks associated with our current strategy to change our asset mix included in item a of this form k 
outlook management intends to continue pursuing acquisitions and developments that meet our criteria for property quality  market strength  and investment return 
management will continue to use our unsecured line of credit to provide short term financing for acquisition  development  and re development activities and plans to continue to replace significant borrowings under the bank line of credit with funds generated from the sale of properties and the sale of additional debt and equity securities and permanent financing  as market conditions permit 
management believes that these potential sources of funds  along with the possibility of issuing limited partnership units of crlp in exchange for properties  will provide us with the means to finance additional acquisitions  developments  and expansions 

table of contents in addition to the issuance of equity and debt  management is investigating alternate financing methods and sources to raise future capital 
private placements  joint ventures  and non traditional equity and debt offerings are some of the alternatives we are contemplating 
management anticipates that our net cash provided by operations and our existing cash balances will provide the necessary funds on a short and long term basis to cover our operating expenses  interest expense on outstanding indebtedness  recurring capital expenditures  and dividends to shareholders in accordance with internal revenue code requirements applicable to reits 
inflation leases at the multifamily properties generally provide for an initial term of six months to one year and allow for rent adjustments at the time of renewal 
leases at the office properties typically provide for rent adjustments and the pass through of certain operating expenses during the term of the lease 
substantially all of the leases at the retail properties provide for the pass through to tenants of certain operating costs  including real estate taxes  common area maintenance expenses  and insurance 
all of these provisions permit us to increase rental rates or other charges to tenants in response to rising prices and  therefore  serve to minimize our exposure to the adverse effects of inflation 
an increase in general price levels may immediately precede  or accompany  an increase in interest rates 
at december   our exposure to rising interest rates was mitigated by the existing consolidated debt level of of our total market capitalization  the high percentage of consolidated fixed rate debt and the use of interest rate swaps to effectively fix the interest rate on approximately million through march as it relates to the short term  an increase in interest expense resulting from increasing inflation is anticipated to be less than future increases in income before interest 
funds from operations funds from operations ffo is useful to investors as a measure of performance for an equity reit that provides a relevant basis for comparison among reits 
ffo  as defined by nareit  means net income loss before minority interest determined in accordance with gaap  excluding gains losses from debt restructuring and sales of depreciated property  plus real estate depreciation and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo is presented to assist investors in analyzing our performance 
prior to january   we had also included marketing fees on sales transactions within ffo  in which we used internal employees to complete the asset sales 
effective january   we conformed our ffo definition to adhere to the nareit white paper definition 
as a result  we are no longer including marketing fees on sales transactions and we are no longer excluding straight line rents to arrive at ffo 
we believe that ffo is useful to investors because it provides an additional indicator of our financial and operating performance 
this is because  by excluding the effect of real estate depreciation and gains or losses from sales of depreciated properties all of which are based on historical costs which may be of limited relevance in evaluating current performance  ffo can facilitate comparison of operating performance among equity reits 
our method of calculating ffo may be different from methods used by other reits and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
ffo i does not represent cash flows from operations as defined by gaap  ii is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs and liquidity  including our ability to make distributions  and iii should not be considered as an alternative to net income as determined in accordance with gaap for purposes of evaluating our operating performance
