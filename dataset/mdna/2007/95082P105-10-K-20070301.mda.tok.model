table of contents the following table sets forth information about us by geographic area net sales long lived assets year ended december  december  in thousands united states foreign operations canada other foreign subtotal foreign operations total us and foreign management information systems we have implemented data processing systems to provide support for a full range of business functions  such as customer service  inventory and logistics management  accounting and administrative support 
our branch information system  known as wesnet  is the primary data processing vehicle for all branch operations other than our bruckner integrated supply division  communications supply holding  inc communications supply and certain acquired branches 
the wesnet system provides all of the basic day to day order management and order fulfillment functions 
the wesnet application and server reside locally within each branch and provide us with a flexible and cost effective approach to facilitate expansion and organizational growth 
the distributed systems are connected to a centralized data processing center via a wide area network that provides a tightly coupled  yet flexible system 
the centralized corporate information system and data warehouse provide a platform with capability that we believe exceeds many of the most advanced enterprise resource planning packages available on the market 
our centralized servers contain near real time transactional data from each branch system  as well as multiple years of historical transaction data 
the centralized server and data warehouse technology provide a cost effective mechanism to better monitor  manage and enhance operational processes 
these systems have become the principal technology supporting inventory management  purchasing management  automated stock replenishment  margin analysis  and financial and operating analytics 
the data warehouse is also utilized to perform extensive operational analysis and provide detailed insight for all major business processes 
by providing this technology  employees at all levels have the ability to analyze their area of responsibility and drive improvements through the organization 
the system contains a variety of analytic tools  including activity based costing capability for analyzing profitability by customer  sales representative  product type and shipment type 
many other tools permit analysis of sales and margins  supplier sales planning  item analysis  market analysis  product insight and many other operational reporting and trending applications 
the centralized platform facilitates the processing of customer orders  shipping notices  suppliers purchase orders and funds transfer via edi 
we have long supported standard edi with many trading partners 
over the years  we have added capability to support several other integration vehicles beyond standard edi to better support our customers needs 
the evolving integration capability allows us to seamlessly connect our information systems platform with those of our customers and suppliers 
our e commerce purchasing and order fulfillment platform is a user friendly platform that will be integrated with our legacy systems 
our integrated supply services are supported by state of the art proprietary procurement and inventory management systems 
these systems provide a fully integrated  flexible supply chain platform that currently handles over of our integrated supply customers transactions electronically 
our configuration options for a customer range from online linkages to the customer s business and purchasing systems  to total replacement of a customer s procurement and inventory management system for mro supplies 
competition we believe that we are the largest distributor in the estimated billion us electrical distribution industry and the largest provider of integrated supply services for mro goods and services in the united states 
we operate in a highly competitive and fragmented industry 
we compete directly with national  regional and local providers of electrical and other industrial mro supplies 
in  the latest year for which industry published market share data is available  the four national distributors  including us  accounted for approximately of estimated total industry sales 
competition is primarily focused on the local service area  and is generally based on product line breadth  product availability  service capabilities and price 
another source of competition is buying groups formed by smaller distributors to increase purchasing power and provide some cooperative marketing capability 
while increased buying power may improve the competitive position of buying groups locally  we believe these groups have not been able to compete effectively with us for national account customers due to the difficulty in coordinating a diverse ownership group 
although certain internet based procurement service companies  auction businesses and trade exchanges remain in the marketplace  the impact on our business from these potential competitors has been minimal to date

risk factors 
the following factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified by the following cautionary statements our outstanding indebtedness requires debt service obligations that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and could limit our growth and impose restrictions on our business 
as of december   we had billion of consolidated indebtedness  including million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes  million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the debentures  and million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the debentures and together with the debentures  the debentures  and stockholders equity of million 
we and our subsidiaries may incur additional indebtedness in the future  subject to certain limitations contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness 
these amounts include our accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility  through which we sell up to million of our accounts receivable to a third party conduit 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates 
our debt service obligations have important consequences  including but not limited to the following a substantial portion of cash flow from our operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for operations  future business opportunities and acquisitions and other purposes  and increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future may be limited  we may be hindered in our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  and we may be required to incur additional interest due to the contingent interest features of the debentures  which are embedded derivatives 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt  refinance our indebtedness  make scheduled payments on our operating leases  fund planned capital expenditures or to finance acquisitions will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  make necessary capital expenditures or meet other cash needs 
if unable to do so  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  to sell assets or to obtain additional financing 
our receivables facility has a three year term and is subject to renewal in may there can be no assurance that available funding or any sale of assets or additional financing would be possible at the time of renewal in amounts or terms favorable to us  if at all 
over the next three years  we are obligated to pay approximately million  of which million is related to our receivables facility  million is related to our mortgage credit facility  million is related to notes payable associated with acquisitions  and million is related to capital leases 
additionally  various acquisition agreements contain contingent consideration for final acquisition payments  which management has estimated will be million and which is reported as deferred acquisition payable 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
our debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 
our credit facilities and the indenture governing wesco distribution s senior subordinated indebtedness contain  and any of our future debt agreements may contain  certain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt or issue guarantees  create liens  make certain investments  enter into transactions with our affiliates  sell certain assets  make capital expenditures  redeem capital stock or make other restricted payments  declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders  and merge or consolidate with any person 

table of contents our credit facilities also require us to maintain specific earnings to fixed expenses and debt to earnings ratios and to meet minimum net worth requirements 
in addition  our credit facilities contain additional affirmative and negative covenants 
our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance  which will be subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including prevailing economic conditions 
as a result of these covenants  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us 
in addition  our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the debentures  the notes and our other debt  which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt 
if any of our debt is accelerated  we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt 
we may be unable to repurchase the debentures or the notes for cash when required by the holders  including following a fundamental change 
holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase the respective debentures on specified dates or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change prior to maturity 
the occurrence of a change of control would also constitute an event of default under our credit facilities  requiring repayment of amounts outstanding thereunder  and the occurrence of a change of control would also enable holders of the notes to require wesco distribution to repurchase such notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest  if any 
any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions 
we may not have sufficient funds to make the required repayments and repurchase at such time or the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  our ability to repurchase the debentures or the notes in cash may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our debt outstanding at the time  including other credit facilities  which will limit our ability to purchase the debentures or notes for cash in certain circumstances 
if we fail to repurchase the debentures or notes in cash as required by the respective indentures  it would constitute an event of default under the applicable indenture  which  in turn  would constitute an event of default under our credit facilities and the other indenture 
provisions of the debentures could discourage an acquisition of the company by a third party 
certain provisions of the debentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us 
upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change  holders of the debentures will have the right  at their option  to require us to repurchase all of their debentures or any portion of the principal amount of such debentures in integral multiples of  in addition  the occurrence of certain change of control transactions may result in the debentures becoming convertible for additional shares or result in antidilution adjustments which may have an effect of making an acquisition of us less attractive 
we may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion or provide for conversion into the acquirer s capital stock in the event of certain fundamental changes 
if the financial condition of our customers declines  our credit risk could increase 
in light of the financial stresses within the worldwide automotive industry  certain automakers and tier one mirror customers have already declared bankruptcy or may be considering bankruptcy 
should one or more of our larger customers declare bankruptcy  it could adversely impact the collectibility of our accounts receivable  bad debt expense and net income 
downturns in the electrical distribution industry have had in the past  and may in the future have  an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
the electrical distribution industry is affected by changes in economic conditions  including national  regional and local slowdowns in construction and industrial activity  which are outside our control 
our operating results may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates that may lead to a decline in economic activity  particularly in the construction market  while simultaneously resulting in higher interest payments under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  during periods of economic slowdown such as the one we recently experienced  our credit losses  based on history  could increase 
there can be no assurance that economic slowdowns  adverse economic conditions or cyclical trends in certain customer markets will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
an increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we compete directly with national  regional and local providers of electrical and other industrial mro supplies 
competition is primarily focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth  product availability  service capabilities and price 
other sources of competition are buying groups formed by smaller distributors to increase purchasing power and provide some cooperative marketing capability 

table of contents some of our existing competitors have  and new market entrants may have  greater financial and marketing resources than us 
to the extent existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices  we may be required to lower our prices for current services  thereby adversely affecting financial results 
existing or future competitors also may seek to compete with us for acquisitions  which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable acquisitions 
in addition  it is possible that competitive pressures resulting from industry consolidation could affect our growth and profit margins 
loss of key suppliers or lack of product availability could decrease sales and earnings 
most of our agreements with suppliers are terminable by either party on days notice or less 
our ten largest suppliers in accounted for approximately of our purchases for the period 
our largest supplier in was eaton corporation  through its eaton electrical division  accounting for approximately of our purchases 
the loss of  or a substantial decrease in the availability of  products from any of these suppliers  or the loss of key preferred supplier agreements  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials  labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments  transportation disruptions  or other reasons beyond our control 
in addition  certain of our products  such as wire and conduit  are commodity price based products and may be subject to significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control 
an interruption of operations at any of our distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on the operations of branches served by the affected distribution center 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that particular products or product lines will be available to us  or available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand 
such limited product access could cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage 
acquisitions that we may undertake would involve a number of inherent risks  any of which could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result 
we have historically expanded our operations through selected acquisitions of businesses and assets 
acquisitions involve various inherent risks  such as uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  the potential loss of key employees of an acquired business  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction  problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business  and unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition or other transaction rationale 
any one or more of these factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of businesses or assets 
goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired 
as of december   our goodwill and other intangible assets amounted to billion  net of accumulated amortization 
to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash flows to recover the net amount of any investments in goodwill and other intangible assets recorded  the investment could be considered impaired and subject to write off 
we expect to record further goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of future acquisitions we may complete 
future amortization of such other intangible assets or impairments  if any  of goodwill or intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations in any given period 
a disruption of our information systems could increase expenses  decrease sales or reduce earnings 
a serious disruption of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our computer systems are an integral part of our business and growth strategies 
we depend on our information systems to process orders  manage inventory and accounts receivable collections  purchase products  ship products to our customers on a timely basis  maintain cost effective operations and provide superior service to our customers 
our business may be harmed by required compliance with anti terrorism measures and regulations 
following the terrorist attacks on the united states  a number of federal  state and local authorities have implemented various security measures  including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks  such as the ones that we and our suppliers use 
if security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our suppliers deliveries of the product inventory we need or our deliveries of our product to our customers  we may not be able to meet the needs of our customers or may incur additional expenses to do so 

table of contents anti takeover provisions could negatively impact our stockholders 
provisions of delaware law and of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of us 
for example  we are subject to section of the delaware general corporation law  which would make it more difficult for another party to acquire us without the approval of our board of directors 
our board of directors is divided into three classes  with each class serving a three year term 
additionally  our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without requiring any stockholder approval  and preferred stock could be issued as a defensive measure in response to a takeover proposal 
these provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us even if an acquisition might be in the best interest of our stockholders 
there may be future dilution of our common stock 
to the extent options to purchase common stock under our stock option plans are exercised  holders of our common stock will incur dilution 
additionally  our debentures include contingent conversion price provisions and options for settlement in shares  which would increase dilution to our stockholders 
there is a risk that the market value of our common stock may decline 
stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations  and the market prices of companies in our industry have been volatile 
it is impossible to predict whether the price of our common stock will rise or fall 
trading prices of our common stock will be influenced by our operating results and prospects and by economic  financial and other factors 
future sales of our common stock in the public market or issuance of securities senior to our common stock could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and the value of the debentures and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock or equity related securities in the public market  or the perception that such sales could occur  could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and the value of the debentures and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity related securities 
no prediction can be made as to the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock or the value of the debentures

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in item of this annual report on form k 
company overview in  we achieved significant organic growth  completed a major acquisition  executed new initiatives to reduce cost  issued additional lower cost debt and increased financing availability under our revolving credit agreement and receivables facility 
in addition  we saw favorable market conditions that reflected improved activity levels in our major end markets 
our financial results reflect sales growth in our served markets  along with positive impact from our recent acquisitions and productivity initiatives 
sales increased over the same period last year  and our gross margin percentage was compared to in the prior year 
during  sales from our recent acquisitions were million and accounted for approximately of the sales increase 
higher commodity prices  increased demand and favorable exchange rates  offset by reduced hurricane activity also contributed to the higher revenues 
operating income increased to million primarily from organic growth from the base business along with income from operations acquired in the third quarter of the combination of all these factors led to net income of million  an increase of 
diluted earnings per share increased in to compared with in our end markets consist of industrial  construction  utility and commercial  institutional and governmental customers 
our sales to reach these markets can be categorized as stock  direct ship and special order 
stock orders are filled directly from existing inventory and generally represent approximately of total sales 
approximately of our total sales are direct ship sales 
direct ship sales are typically custom built products  large orders or products that are too bulky to be easily handled and  as a result  are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier 
special orders are for products that are not ordinarily stocked in inventory and are ordered based on a customer s specific request 
special orders represent the remainder of total sales 
we have historically financed our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions and new branch openings through internally generated cash flow  borrowings under our credit facilities and funding through our receivables facility 
our acquisition of communications supply in november for approximately million was financed using proceeds from the offering of our debentures  borrowings from our revolving credit facility and receivables facility and cash from operations 
cash flow we generated million in operating cash flow during included in this amount were million of cash outflow from a reduction in our receivables facility  whereby we sell  on a continuous basis  an undivided interest in all domestic accounts receivable to wesco receivables corp  a wholly owned  special purpose entity spe 
acquisition payments made in net of cash acquired were million for the acquisition of communications supply  million for purchase price adjustments related to the acquisition of carlton bates and million in earnout payments arising from prior acquisitions 
in june  we paid million pursuant to the terms of a note payable relating to our acquisition in of bruckner supply company  inc bruckner 
during  we received gross proceeds from the issuance of our debentures of million 
financing availability as of december   we had approximately million in total available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility and had drawn million under our receivables facility 
outlook management anticipates that overall economic growth will continue through  and this is expected to lead to increased product demand and sales growth 
our continued focus on margin and operating productivity improvement should produce enhanced financial performance in we plan to use cash flow from operations plus our credit facilities to fund working capital requirements and capital expenditures  to pay down debt  to repurchase shares and to fund the cost of acquisitions  if any 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to supplier programs  bad debts  inventories  insurance costs  goodwill  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to reserve items may be required 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized for product sales when title  ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer  or for services when the service is rendered or evidence of a customer arrangement exists 
in the case of stock sales and special orders  a sale occurs at the time of shipment from our distribution point  as the terms of our sales are fob shipping point 
in cases where we process customer orders but ship directly from our suppliers  revenue is recognized once product is shipped and title has passed 
for some of our customers  we provide services such as inventory management or other specific support 
revenues are recognized upon evidence of fulfillment of the agreed upon services 
in all cases  revenue is recognized once the sales price to our customer is fixed or is determinable and we have reasonable assurance as to the collectibility in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
gross profit our calculation of gross profit is net sales less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes our cost of the products sold and excludes cost for warehousing  selling  general and administrative expenses and depreciation and amortization  which are reported separately in the statement of income 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we have a systematic procedure using estimates based on historical data and reasonable assumptions of collectibles made at the local branch level and on a consolidated corporate basis to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a systematic procedure is used to determine excess and obsolete inventory reflecting historical data and reasonable assumptions for the percentage of excess and obsolete inventory on a consolidated basis 
supplier volume rebates we receive rebates from certain suppliers based on contractual arrangements with them 
since there is a lag between actual purchases and the rebates received from the suppliers  we must estimate and accrue the approximate amount of rebates available at a specific date 
we record the amounts as other accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
the corresponding rebate income is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
the appropriate level of such income is derived from the level of actual purchases made by us from suppliers  in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we test goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
this process involves estimating fair value using discounted cash flow analyses 
considerable management judgment is necessary to estimate discounted future cash flows 
assumptions used for these estimated cash flows were based on a combination of historical results and current internal forecasts 
two primary assumptions were an average long term revenue growth ranging from to depending on the end market served and a discount rate of 
we cannot predict certain events that could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets  which totaled million at december  and million at december  
table of contents intangible assets we account for certain economic benefits purchased as a result of our acquisitions  including customer relations  distribution agreements and trademarks  as intangible assets 
except for trademarks  which have an indefinite life  we amortize intangible assets over a useful life determined by the expected cash flows produced by such intangibles and their respective tax benefits 
useful lives vary between and years  depending on the specific intangible asset 
insurance programs we use commercial insurance for auto  workers compensation  casualty and health claims as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses 
our strategy involves large deductibles where we must pay all costs up to the deductible amount 
we estimate our reserve based on historical incident rates and costs 
income taxes we record our deferred tax assets at amounts that are expected to be realized 
we evaluate future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we review tax issues and positions taken on tax returns and determine the need and amount of contingency reserves necessary to cover any probable audit adjustments 
stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are comprised of fixed stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights 
during the year ended december   we adopted the measurement provisions of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
stock options awarded prior to were accounted for under the intrinsic value method ie the difference between the market price on the exercise date and the price paid by the employee to exercise the options under accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees 
beginning january   we adopted sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method 
under sfas r  compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at fair value on date of grant and compensation cost is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of stock based awards is determined using the black scholes valuation model  which is consistent with the valuation techniques previously utilized for stock based awards in footnote disclosures required under sfas expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock 
we estimate the expected life of the option or stock settled appreciation right using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant 
the forfeiture assumption is based on our historical employee behavior  which we review on an annual basis 
no dividends are assumed 
we recognized million including million due to the adoption of sfas r and related to the vesting in of options granted prior to january    and million of non cash stock based compensation expense  which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses  in   and respectively 
as of december   there was million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to non vested stock based compensation arrangements for all awards previously made of which approximately million is expected to be recognized in  million in and million in accounts receivable securitization facility under our receivables facility  we sell  on a continuous basis  all domestic accounts receivable to wesco receivables corporation  a wholly owned spe 
the spe sells  without recourse  a senior undivided interest in the receivables to third party conduits and financial institutions for cash while maintaining a subordinated undivided interest  in the form of over collateralization  in a portion of the receivables 
we account for the receivables facility in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas no 

prior to december  we accounted for transfers of receivables pursuant to the facility as a sale and removed them from our balance sheet 
expenses associated with the facility were reported as other expense in the statement of income 
in december  the receivables facility was amended such that we effectively maintain control of receivables transferred pursuant to the facility  therefore the transfers no longer qualify for sale treatment under sfas no 
as a result  the transferred receivables remain on our balance sheet  and we now recognize the related secured borrowing 
expenses associated with the receivables facility will be reported as interest expense in the statement of income beginning in

primary uses of cash in were million for investment in inventories  million in accounts payable and million for receivables resulting from higher sales volume and approximately million from other net working capital adjustments 
in  primary sources of cash were net income of million  a million increase in accounts payable driven by increased purchases due to growth  a million increase in accrued payroll and benefit costs reflecting increases in related costs and a million increase in prepaid and other related assets  principally driven by tax refunds and reductions in prepaid items 
the remaining sources of cash were million of non cash expenses included in net income and million from other net working capital items

generally  our purchase orders and contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation 
we do not have significant agreements to purchase material or goods that would specify minimum order quantities 
management believes that cash generated from operations  together with amounts available under our revolving credit facility and the receivables facility  will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditures estimated to be million in and other cash requirements for the foreseeable future 
there can be no assurance  however  that this will be or will continue to be the case 
accounts receivable securitization facility we maintain a receivables facility  which had a total purchase commitment of million as of december  the receivables facility has a term of three years and is subject to renewal in may under the receivables facility  we sell  on a continuous basis  all domestic accounts receivable to wesco receivables corporation  a wholly owned spe 
the spe sells  without recourse  a senior undivided interest in the receivables to third party conduits and financial institutions for cash while maintaining a subordinated undivided interest  in the form of over collateralization  in a portion of the receivables 
we have agreed to continue servicing the sold receivables for the financial institution at market rates  accordingly  no servicing asset or liability has been recorded 
as of december  and  accounts receivable eligible for securitization totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which the subordinated retained interest was approximately million and million  respectively 
in december  the receivables facility was amended such that the company effectively maintains control of receivables transferred pursuant to the facility  therefore the transfers no longer qualify for sale treatment under sfas no 
accordingly  the balance sheet as of december  reflects million of previously transferred accounts receivable balances that we re gained control of  as well as assumed borrowings for an equal amount 
as of december   million of accounts receivable balances were removed from the balance sheet because they qualified for sale treatment under sfas no 

table of contents costs associated with the receivables facility totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these amounts are recorded as other expenses in the consolidated statements of income and are primarily related to the discount and loss on the sale of accounts receivables  partially offset by related servicing revenue 
the key economic assumptions used to measure the retained interest at the date of the securitization for securitizations completed in were a discount rate of and an estimated life of months 
at december   an immediate adverse change in the discount rate or estimated life of and would result in a reduction in the fair value of the retained interest of million and million  respectively 
these sensitivities are hypothetical and should be used with caution 
as the figures indicate  changes in fair value based on a variation in assumptions generally cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
also  in this example  the effect of a variation in a particular assumption on the fair value of the retained interest is calculated without changing any other assumption 
in reality  changes in one factor may result in changes in another 
inflation the rate of inflation  as measured by changes in the consumer price index  did not have a material effect on our sales or operating results during the periods presented 
however  inflation in the future could affect our operating costs 
overall  price changes from suppliers have historically been consistent with inflation and have not had a material impact on the results of operations 
in recent years  prices of certain commodities have increased much faster than inflation 
in most cases we have been able to pass through a majority of these increases to customers 
seasonality our operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal factors 
sales during the first quarter are generally less than below the sales of the remaining three quarters due to a reduced level of activity during the winter months of january and february 
sales increase beginning in march with slight fluctuations per month through december 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in march  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas which amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities  with respect to the accounting for separately recognized servicing assets and servicing liabilities 
this statement clarifies when servicing rights should be separately accounted for  requires companies to account for separately recognized servicing rights initially at fair value  and gives companies the option of subsequently accounting for those servicing rights at either fair value or under the amortization method 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after september  consistent with its requirements  we will adopt sfas on january  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an entity s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
it prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement disclosure of tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
on january   the fasb affirmed its previous decision to make fin effective for fiscal years beginning after december  accordingly  fin is effective for us on january  the initial impact to the consolidated balance sheet is expected to be between million and million 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  wesco is currently evaluating the effect that implementation of sfas will have on its financial position  results of operations  and cash flows 
in september  the sec released staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements  which provided the staff s view regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements 
sab requires an analysis of misstatements using both an income statement rollover approach and balance sheet iron curtain approach in assessing materiality and provides for a one time cumulative effect transition adjustment 
the evaluation requirements of sab no 
are effective for years ending after november  the adoption of sab no 
will not impact our consolidated financial statements

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency risks approximately of our sales are denominated in us dollars and are primarily from customers in the united states 
as a result  currency fluctuations are currently not material to our operating results 
we do have foreign subsidiaries located in north america  europe and asia and may establish additional foreign subsidiaries in the future 
accordingly  we may derive a more significant portion of our sales from international operations  and a portion of these sales may be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our future operating results could become subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of those currencies in relation to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
we have monitored and will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 
interest rate risk at various times  we have refinanced our fixed rate debt to better leverage the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
the majority of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuations in interest rates 
our variable rate borrowings at december  and of million  which includes million from the receivables facility  and million  respectively  represented approximately and of total indebtedness at december  and  respectively 
fixed rate borrowings in  we reduced our borrowing rate on a major portion of our fixed rate debt  redeeming million in aggregate principal amount of our notes at  and issuing million aggregate principal amount of our notes at and million aggregate principal amount of our debentures at 
in  we issued additional lower cost debt which includes million aggregate principal amount of debentures at 
as these borrowings were issued at fixed rates  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate fluctuations  although market value would be 
except for the debentures  fair value approximated carrying value of these debt instruments see note  debt 
interest expense on our other fixed rate debt also was not impacted due to changes in market interest rates  and fair value approximated carrying value for this debt as well 
floating rate borrowings we borrow under our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
during  our average daily borrowing under the facility was million 
borrowings under our facility bear interest at the applicable libor or base rate  as defined  and therefore we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
additionally  we borrow under our receivables facility  which bears interest at the day commercial paper rate plus applicable margin
