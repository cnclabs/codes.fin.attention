item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following is a discussion of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company appearing under item herein 
certain amounts applicable to the prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the classifications currently followed 
such reclassifications do not affect earnings or stockholders equity 
general business 
omega is the largest us producer of protein rich meal and oil derived from marine sources 
the company s products are produced from menhaden a herring like fish found in commercial quantities  and include regular grade and value added specialty fish meals  crude and refined fish oils and fish solubles 
the company s fish meal products are used as nutritional feed additives by animal feed manufacturers and by commercial livestock producers 
the company s crude fish oil is sold to food producers and feed manufacturers  and its refined fish oil products are used in food production and certain industrial applications 
fish solubles are sold as protein additives for animal feed and as fertilizers 
fishing 
the company s harvesting season generally extends from may through december on the mid atlantic coast and from april through october on the gulf coast 
during the off season and the first few months of each fishing season  the company fills purchase orders from the inventory it has accumulated during the previous fishing season or in some cases  by re selling meal purchased from other suppliers 
on august   the company s moss point  mississippi fish processing facility and adjacent shipyard were severely damaged by hurricane katrina 
on september   the company s cameron  louisiana and abbeville  louisiana fish processing facilities were also severely damaged by hurricane rita 
each of these facilities was non operational immediately after these weather events 
operations at the moss point fish processing facility  the abbeville fish processing facility and the shipyard were re established in mid october   but at reduced processing capabilities 
these two facilities were returned to full operational status prior to the beginning of the gulf fishing season in april operations at the cameron fish processing facility were re established in june  but at reduced processing capabilities 
the cameron facility became fully operational in september the direct impact of the two hurricanes upon the company was a loss of physical inventories and physical damage to the plants 
the interruption of processing capabilities caused the company to address the impact of abnormal downtime of its processing facilities  which resulted in the immediate recognition of costs which would ordinarily have been captured as inventory costs 
the amounts of these losses are more fully described in notes    and to the consolidated financial statements 
the fish catch is processed into three general types of products  fish meal  fish oil and fish solubles at the company s four meal and oil processing plants  two in louisiana  one in mississippi and one in virginia 
harvesting and production 
the following table summarizes the company s harvesting and production for the indicated periods years ended december  fish catch tons production tons fish meal regular grade special select sea lac oil crude refined solubles total production fish catch has been converted to tons using the national marine fisheries service nmfs fish catch conversion ratio of pounds per  fish 
the company s harvesting and processing business is seasonal and fluctuates from year to year and month to month due to natural conditions over which the company has no control 
for example  the oil yield results were the poorest in recent company history 
for illustrative purposes  the company s oil yields for the fishing season were lower by compared to those in the fishing season and were lower by compared to the company s year oil yield average 
the causes of lower fish oil yields are believed to relate to fish diet  weather and water temperature but are not generally well understood 
the impact of these poor oil yields in has resulted in significantly higher per unit inventory costs and fewer volumes available for future sale 
these higher costs and fewer volumes available for sale have adversely impacted financial results for the fourth quarter of and are expected to adversely impact financial results for the first quarter of  and to some extent  the second quarter of in addition  in late  the company s gulf coast facilities were rendered inoperable due to hurricanes katrina and rita 
two of the three facilities regained operational status prior to the end of the fishing season and the other facility did not regain its operational status until the season 
these hurricane damages adversely affected the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
markets 
pricing for the company s products has been volatile in the past several years and is attributable mainly to the international availability  or the perceived international availability  of fish meal and fish oil inventories 
in an effort to reduce price volatility and to generate higher  more consistent profit margins  the company has implemented a quality control program designed to increase its capability of producing higher quality fish meal products and  in conjunction therewith  enhanced it sales efforts to penetrate premium product markets 
since  the company s sales volumes of specialty meal products have increased approximately 
future volumetric growth in specialty meal sales will be dependant upon increased harvesting efforts and market demand 
additionally  the company is attempting to introduce its refined fish oil into the food market 
the company has made sales  which to date have not been material  of its refined fish oil  trademarked omegapure  to food manufacturers in the united states and canada at prices that provide substantially improved margins over the margins that can be obtained from selling non refined crude fish oil 
the company cannot estimate  however  the size of the actual domestic or international markets for omega pure or how long it may take to develop these markets 
during  the company developed a business plan to expand its purchase and resale of other manufacturers fish meal and fish oil products and engaged a full time consultant to implement the company s business plan which focused initially on the purchase and resale of mexican fish meal and fish oil 
in  revenues generated from these types of transactions represented less than of total company revenues 
during  and again in  the company s fish catch and resultant product inventories were reduced  primarily due to adverse weather conditions 
the company supplemented its inventories and subsequent sales by purchasing other fish meal and oil products 
although operating margins from these activities are less than the margins typically generated from the company s base domestic production  these operations provide the company with a source of fish meal and oil to sell into other markets where the company has not historically had a presence 
the company purchased products totaling approximately   and  tons  or approximately  and of total volume sales for the fiscal year ended december   and  respectively 
historically  approximately to of omega s faq fish meal was sold on a two to twelve month forward contract basis 
the balance of regular grade and other products was substantially sold on a spot basis through purchase orders 
the company began a similar forward sales program for its specialty grade meals and crude fish oil for due to increasing demand for these products 
during  and approximately  and respectively  of its specialty meals and crude fish oil had been sold on a forward contract basis 
the company s annual revenues are highly dependent on both annual fish catch and inventories and  in addition  inventory is generally carried over from one year to another year 
the company determines the level of inventory to be carried over based on prevailing market prices of the products and anticipated customer usage and demand during the off season 
thus  production volume does not necessarily correlate with sales volume in the same year and sales volumes will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and month to month 
the company s fish meal products have a useable life of approximately one year from date of production 
practically  however  the company typically attempts to empty its warehouses of the previous season s products by the second or third month of the new fishing season 
the company s crude fish oil products do not lose efficacy unless exposed to oxygen and therefore  their storage life typically is longer than that of fish meal 
the following table sets forth the company s revenues by product in millions and the approximate percentage of total revenues represented thereby  for the indicated periods years ended december  revenues percent revenues percent revenues percent regular grade special select sealac crude oil refined oil fish solubles other total critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein  including estimates about the effects of matters or future events that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant of these requiring difficult or complex judgments in any particular period involve the costing of inventory  including inventory lower of cost or market analyses and the company s accounting for various losses on self insurance retentions 
hurricane losses on august   the company s moss point  mississippi fish processing facility and adjacent shipyard were severely damaged by hurricane katrina 
on september   the company s cameron  louisiana and abbeville  louisiana fish processing facilities were also severely damaged by hurricane rita 
each of these facilities was non operational immediately after these weather events 
operations at the moss point fish processing facility  the abbeville fish processing facility and the shipyard were re established in mid october   but at reduced processing capabilities 
these two plants became fully operational prior to the start of the gulf fishing season 
operations at the cameron fish processing facility were re established in june  but at reduced processing capabilities 
the cameron facility became fully operational in september the direct impact of the two hurricanes upon the company was a loss of physical inventories and physical damage to the plants 
the interruption of processing capabilities caused the company to address the impact of abnormal downtime of its processing facilities  which resulted in the immediate recognition of costs which would ordinarily have been captured as inventory costs 
the amounts of these losses are more fully described in notes    and to the consolidated financial statements 
the company maintains insurance coverage for a variety of these damages  most notably property  inventory and vessel insurance 
the nature and extent of the insurance coverage varies by line of policy and the company has recorded insurance recoveries as long term receivables within other assets based on estimates of probable recoveries 
the company anticipates that further recoveries could be available  but such additional recoveries will require further analysis and discussions with the company s insurance carriers and adjusters and the resolution of the lawsuit filed by the company against its property insurance carriers described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
such recoveries  if any  would be recognized in future periods once they are deemed probable 
the company does not maintain business interruption insurance in any material amounts 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue principally from the sales of a variety of protein and oil products derived from menhaden 
the company recognizes revenue for the sale of its products when title and rewards of ownership to its products are transferred to the customer 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates at each balance sheet date the continued appropriateness of the carrying value of its long lived assets including its long term receivables and property  plant and equipment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposals of long lived assets 
the company reviews long lived assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such assets or grouping of assets may not be recoverable 
the company has grouped certain assets together primarily marine vessels for impairment testing on a fleet basis 
if indicators of impairment are present  management would evaluate the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets or grouping of assets compared to the carrying amount of those items 
the net carrying value of assets or grouping of assets not recoverable is reduced to fair value 
the company considers continued operating losses  or significant and long term changes in business conditions  to be its primary indicators of potential impairment 
property  equipment and depreciation property and equipment additions are recorded at cost 
depreciation of property and equipment is computed by the straight line method at rates expected to amortize the cost of property and equipment  net of salvage value  over their estimated useful lives 
estimated useful lives  determined at the date of acquisition  of new assets acquired are based primarily on the review of existing property and equipment 
estimated useful lives are as follows useful lives years fishing vessels and fish processing plants machinery  equipment  furniture and fixtures and other replacements and major improvements are capitalized  maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
upon sale or retirement  the costs and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the accounts 
any resulting gains or losses are included in the statement of operations 
the company capitalizes interest as part of the acquisition cost of a qualifying asset 
interest is capitalized only during the period of time required to complete and prepare the asset for its intended use 
inventories inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market 
the company s fishing season runs from mid april to the first of november in the gulf of mexico and from the beginning of may into december in the atlantic 
government regulations generally preclude the company from fishing during the off seasons 
the company s inventory cost system considers all costs associated with an annual fish catch and its processing  both variable and fixed  including both costs incurred during the off season and during the fishing season 
the company s costing system allocates cost to inventory quantities on a per unit basis as calculated by a formula that considers total estimated inventoriable costs for a fishing season including off season costs to total estimated fish catch and the relative fair market value of the individual products produced 
the company adjusts the cost of sales  off season costs and inventory balances at the end of each quarter based on revised estimates of total inventoriable costs and fish catch 
the company s lower of cost or market value analyses at year end and at interim periods compares total estimated per unit production cost of the company s expected production to the projected per unit market prices of the products 
the impairment analyses involve estimates of  among other things  future fish catches and related costs  and expected commodity prices for the fish products 
these estimates  which management believes are reasonable and supportable  involve estimates of future activities and events which are inherently imprecise and from which actual results may differ materially 
revisions in such estimates or actual results could materially impact the company s results of operation and financial position 
any costs incurred during abnormal down time related to activity at the company s plants are charged to expense as incurred 
during the off seasons  in connection with the upcoming fishing seasons  the company incurs costs ie  plant and vessel related labor  utilities  rent  repairs and depreciation that are directly related to the company s infrastructure 
these costs accumulate in inventory and are applied as elements of the cost of production of the company s products throughout the fishing season ratably based on the company s monthly fish catch and the expected total fish catch for the season 
insurance the company carries insurance for certain losses relating to its vessels and jones act liabilities for employees aboard its vessels 
the company provides reserves for those portions of the annual aggregate deductible for which the company remains responsible by using an estimation process that considers company specific and industry data as well as management s experience  assumptions and consultation with counsel  as these reserves include estimated settlement costs 
management s current estimated range of liabilities related to such cases is based on claims for which management can estimate the amount and range of loss 
for those claims where there may be a range of loss  the company has recorded an estimated liability inside that range  based on management s experience  assumptions and consultation with counsel 
the process of estimating and establishing reserves for these claims is inherently uncertain and the actual ultimate net cost of a claim may vary materially from the estimated amount reserved 
there is some degree of inherent variability in assessing the ultimate amount of losses associated with these claims due to the extended period of time that transpires between when the claim might occur and the full settlement of such claims 
this variability is generally greater for jones act claims by vessel employees 
the company continually evaluates loss estimates associated with claims and losses as additional information becomes available and revises its estimates 
although management believes estimated reserves related to these claims are adequately recorded  it is possible that actual results could significantly differ from the recorded reserves  which could materially impact the company s results of operations  financial position and cash flow 
with respect to health insurance  the company is primarily self insured 
the company purchases individual stop loss coverage with a large deductible 
as a result  the company is primarily self insured for claims and associated costs up to the amount of the deductible  with claims in excess of the deductible amount being covered by insurance 
expected claims estimates are based on health care trend rates and historical claims data  actual claims may differ from those estimates 
the company continually evaluates its claims experience related to this coverage with information obtained from its risk management consultants 
assumptions used in preparing these insurance estimates are based on factors such as claims settlement patterns  claim development trends  claim frequency and severity patterns  inflationary trends and data reasonableness 
together these factors will generally affect the analysis and determination of the best estimate of the projected ultimate claim losses 
the results of these evaluations are used to both analyze and adjust the company s insurance loss reserves 
pension the company estimates income or expense related to its pension plan based on actuarial assumptions  including assumptions regarding discount rates and expected returns on plan assets 
the company determines the discount rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of its pension obligations 
based on historical data and discussions with its actuary  omega determines its expected return on plan assets based on the expected long term rate of return on its plan assets and the market related value of its plan assets 
changes in these assumptions can result in significant changes in estimated pension income or expense 
the company will revise its assumptions on an annual basis based upon changes in current interest rates  return on plan assets and the underlying demographics of the workforce 
these assumptions are reasonably likely to change in future periods and may have a material impact on future earnings 
results of operation the following table sets forth as a percentage of revenues  certain items of the company s operations for each of the indicated periods

other income expense  net 
other income expense  net decreased by  from  in to  in the decrease in other income expense  net was primarily the result of a gain recognized in associated with the involuntary conversion of a piece of equipment resulting from a fire 
provision benefit for income taxes 
the company recorded a million provision for income taxes in representing an effective tax rate of for income taxes compared to in this decrease in the effective tax rate is primarily as a result of the partial exclusion of income on foreign sales  interest income exempt from income tax  income tax credits attributable to post hurricane wages and a state income tax benefit on current year pre tax income resulting from interest expense

provision benefit for income taxes 
the company recorded a million benefit for income taxes in representing an effective tax rate of for income taxes compared to in this increase in the effective tax rate is due to the tax benefit on foreign sales exclusions and net state tax benefits 
the company believes that it is more probable than not that the recorded estimated deferred tax asset benefits and state operating loss carry forwards will be realized 
the statutory tax rate of for us federal taxes was in effect for the respective periods 
liquidity and capital resources historically  the company s primary sources of liquidity and capital resources have been cash flows from operations  bank credit facilities and term loans from various lenders provided pursuant to the us maritime administration s fisheries finance program ffp  which is offered through national marine fisheries services nmfs under title xi of the marine act of title xi 
these sources of cash flows have been used for operations  capital expenditures  payment of long term debt and in the purchase and retirement of shares of the company s common stock 
at december   the company had an unrestricted cash balance of million  down million from december  this decrease was due primarily to increased capital expenditures for damages associated with hurricanes katrina and rita and for equipment purchases and replacements  vessel refurbishments and improvements in fish oil refining technology  increased costs of sales associated with increased sales volumes and the poorest fish oil yields in recent company history and costs associated with the purchase and retirement of shares of the company s common stock held by zapata described below 
the company s annual revenues and its resulting liquidity are highly dependent on annual fish catch  production yields  selling prices for its products and inventories available for sale 
while the company s fish catch and selling prices for its products increased in over  those increases were offset by very poor fish oil yields  which resulted in significantly higher per unit inventory costs and lower volumes of fish oil available for future sale 
these higher costs and lower volumes of fish oil available for sale are expected to adversely impact financial results in the first quarter of  and to some extent  the second quarter of the aggregate amount of the company s outstanding indebtedness at december  was approximately million compared to approximately million at december  as a result  the company has a highly leveraged financial structure  limiting its financial flexibility 
in particular  the company will be required to use a portion of its cash flows to pay principal and interest on its debt  which will reduce the amount of money the company has for operations  capital expenditures  expansion  acquisitions or general corporate or other business activities 
in addition  the covenants contained in the company s debt agreements limit its ability to borrow money in the future for acquisitions  capital expenditures or to meet the company s operating expenses or other general corporate obligations 
see risk factors the company has a substantial amount of indebtedness  which may adversely affect its ability to operate its business  remain in compliance with debt covenants and make payments on its debt 
source of capital operations net cash flow from operating activities increased from approximately million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in operating cash flow is primarily attributable to the increase in net income as described above in results of operations and is partially offset by increased inventory balances 
source of capital debt net financing activities provided used cash of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the year included approximately million in borrowings  of which million was used to purchase and retire  shares of the company s common stock held by zapata the zapata shares  million in debt issuance and treasury stock acquisition costs  million in principal repayments of debt and million in proceeds from stock options exercised 
the year included million used for payments of debt obligations and million in proceeds from stock options exercised  which was offset by million in proceeds from title xi debt 
under title ix  as administered under the ffp  the company has secured loans through lenders with terms generally ranging between and years at interest rates between and per annum which are enhanced with a government guaranty to the lender for up to of the financing 
the company s current title xi borrowings are secured by liens on fishing vessels and mortgages on the company s reedville  virginia and abbeville  louisiana plants 
in  title xi borrowing was modified to permit use of proceeds from borrowings obtained through this program for shore side construction 
in september  the ffp approved the company s financing application in an amount not to exceed million the approval letter 
borrowings under the approval letter are required to be used to finance and or refinance approximately of the actual depreciable cost of the company s future fishing vessel refurbishments and capital expenditures relating to shore side fishing assets  for a term not to exceed years from inception at interest rates determined by the us treasury 
final approval for all such future projects requires individual approval through the secretary of commerce  national oceanic and atmospheric administration  and nmfs 
borrowings under the ffp are required to be evidenced by security agreements  undertakings  and other documents deemed in the sole discretion of the nmfs as necessary to accomplish the intent and purpose of the approval letter 
the company is required to comply with customary nmfs covenants as well as certain special covenants 
the company closed on a million ffp loan on october  on december   pursuant to the title xi program  the ffp approved a second financing application made by the company in the amount of million the second approval letter 
in may  the company submitted a million financing request under the second approval letter the pending loan 
the company expects to receive the financing in the first quarter of as of december   the company had approximately million of borrowings outstanding under title xi and was in compliance with all of the covenants contained therein

the financing facility is secured by a first priority lien on all of the company s assets  other than vessels  real estate and other assets pledged to secure loans made to the company under the ffp  including the pending loan 
the company s prior million revolving credit agreement with bank of america  na was terminated in connection with the company s entry into the financing facility 
aggregate revolving credit loans and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility are limited to an amount at any time outstanding not to exceed the lesser of i million and ii the result of a times the company s trailing month ebitda as defined in the financing agreement  less b the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the term loan and any other secured indebtedness  plus c the amount of the company s unrestricted cash and marketable securities  minus d in the event the company and the collateral agent agree that the lien on certain vessels owned by the company should be released  million 
loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus and the term loan bears interest at a rate per annum equal to libor plus  each subject to adjustment as provided below 
the interest rate on all loans will be reduced by at any time the company s leverage ratio as defined in the financing agreement is equal to or less than x

in addition  the company will not be permitted to have capital expenditures in excess of million for each of the years ending december  through new liens securing future ffp loans other than the pending loan are limited to million in the aggregate during the year ending october  and million during each month period thereafter  provided that if during any such month period the company does not incur the full amount of such future loans  the company may increase the amount of such future loans it may incur during the following month period by of the shortfall 
the financing facility will terminate on october  for a more detailed description of the terms and conditions of the financing facility and financing agreement  see the company s current report on form k filed with the sec on october  as of december   the company had million outstanding under the term loan facility  million outstanding under the revolving credit facility and approximately million in letters of credit issued primarily in support of worker s compensation insurance programs 
as of december   the company had million available under the revolving credit facility and the company was in compliance with all of the covenants under the financing facility 
the company has no off balance sheet arrangements other than normal operating leases and standby letters of credit 
use of capital operations net investing activities used cash of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to any future capital expenditures related to the hurricanes  the company s investing activities consist mainly of capital expenditures for equipment purchases  replacements  vessel refurbishments  and fish oil refining processes 
the company made capital expenditures of approximately million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company anticipates making approximately million in capital expenditures in primarily for the refurbishment of vessels and plant assets and for the repair of certain equipment 
investing activities also includes the receipt of million from an insurance company relating to hurricanes katrina and rita for the years ending december  and the company believes that the existing cash  cash equivalents  short term investments and funds available through the financing facility and or title xi indebtedness described above will be sufficient to meet its working capital and capital expenditure requirements through at least the next twelve months 
in addition  the company expects to receive insurance proceeds from hurricane damages to assist in meeting its capital expenditures 
as of december   the company had an insurance receivable related to hurricane damage recoveries of approximately million 
in conjunction with the company filing a lawsuit against its property insurance carriers as noted in note other assets  million of the receivable was reclassified from current assets to long term assets given the company expects the recovery of the receivable to take place in on february   the company received a third advance from its insurance provider of million 
use of capital acquisitions the company from time to time considers potential transactions including  but not limited to  enhancement of physical facilities to improve production capabilities and the acquisition of other businesses 
certain of the potential transactions reviewed by the company would  if completed  result in its entering new lines of business generally including certain businesses to which the company sells its products such as pet food manufacturers  aquaculture feed manufacturers  fertilizer companies and organic foods manufacturers and distributors  although historically  reviewed opportunities have been generally related in some manner to the company s existing operations or which would have added new protein products to the company s product lines 
although the company does not explicitly budget for acquisitions and  as of the date hereof  does not have any commitment with respect to a material acquisition  it could enter into such agreement in the future 
depending on the size of the acquisition  the company would expect to finance the transaction using internally generated cash flows and its financing facility  or  if necessary  equity or debt financings 
the company cannot assure you that such financings will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
use of capital contractual obligations the following tables aggregate information about the company s contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments in thousands as of december  payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year to years to years after years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases pension funding standby letters of credit total contractual cash obligations as of december   the company had million in standby letters of credit under the million credit subfacility of the financing facility
