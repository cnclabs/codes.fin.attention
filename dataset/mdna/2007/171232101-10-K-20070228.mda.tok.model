critical accounting estimates and judgments the consolidated financial statements include amounts based on informed estimates and judgments of management for transactions that are not yet complete 
such estimates and judgments affect the reported amounts in the financial statements 
those estimates and judgments that were most critical to the preparation of the financial statements involved the determination of loss reserves and the recoverability of related reinsurance recoverables 
these estimates and judgments  which are discussed within the following analysis of our results of operations  require the use of assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain and therefore are subject to change as facts and circumstances develop 
if different estimates and judgments had been applied  materially different amounts might have been reported in the financial statements 
overview the following highlights do not address all of the matters covered in the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations or contain all of the information that may be important to chubb s shareholders or the investing public 
this overview should be read in conjunction with the other sections of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
net income was billion in compared with billion in and billion in the significant increase in net income in was driven by substantially higher underwriting income in our property and casualty insurance business 
results in included a pre tax realized investment gain of million from a transaction we completed in december involving a new reinsurance company  harbor point limited 
as part of the transaction  we transferred our continuing reinsurance assumed business and certain related assets  including renewal rights  to harbor point 
underwriting results were exceptionally profitable in compared with highly profitable results in and our combined loss and expense ratio was in compared with in both and the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined ratio in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in the greater catastrophe impact in was due to costs of million related to hurricane katrina  including estimated net losses of million and net reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million 
total net premiums written decreased by in after increasing by in net premiums written in our insurance business increased in and in the relatively low growth in our insurance business in both years reflected our continued emphasis on underwriting discipline in an increasingly competitive market environment 
in the reinsurance assumed business  net premiums written decreased in and in the decrease in was in line with our expectations following the sale of the ongoing business in december during  we experienced overall favorable development of million on loss reserves established as of the previous year end  due primarily to the lower than expected emergence of losses in the homeowners and commercial property classes 
in december  we entered into a settlement agreement with the attorneys general of new york  connecticut and illinois resolving all issues arising out of those officials investigations with respect to property and casualty insurance market practices 
the settlement did not require that we pay a fine or penalty 
our cost under the settlement was million 
property and casualty investment income after tax increased by in and in the growth was due to an increase in invested assets over the period 
for more information on this non gaap financial measure  see property and casualty insurance investment results 
a summary of our consolidated net income is as follows years ended december in millions property and casualty insurance corporate and other realized investment gains consolidated income before income tax federal and foreign income tax consolidated net income property and casualty insurance a summary of the results of operations of our property and casualty insurance business is as follows years ended december in millions underwriting net premiums written increase in unearned premiums premiums earned losses and loss expenses operating costs and expenses increase in deferred policy acquisition costs dividends to policyholders underwriting income investments investment income before expenses investment expenses investment income other income charges property and casualty income before tax property and casualty investment income after tax property and casualty income before tax in was substantially higher than in which  in turn  was higher than in income in all three years benefited from highly profitable underwriting results 
underwriting income in was substantially higher than in  due largely to significantly lower catastrophe losses and improvement in our specialty insurance business unit 
underwriting income increased modestly in compared with despite significantly higher catastrophe losses  primarily from hurricane katrina 
results in and also benefited from significant increases in investment income 
the profitability of the property and casualty insurance business depends on the results of both underwriting operations and investments 
we view these as two distinct operations since the underwriting functions are managed separately from the investment function 
accordingly  in assessing our performance  we evaluate underwriting results separately from investment results 
underwriting operations underwriting results we evaluate the underwriting results of our property and casualty insurance business in the aggregate and also for each of our separate business units 
net premiums written net premiums written amounted to billion in  a decrease of compared with a modest increase in premiums from our insurance business was more than offset by a decline in premiums from our reinsurance assumed business 
net premiums written increased in over  as an increase in premiums from our insurance business was partially offset by a decline in premiums from our reinsurance assumed business 
net premiums written by business unit were as follows years ended december increase increase decrease decrease vs 
vs 
dollars in millions personal insurance commercial insurance specialty insurance total insurance reinsurance assumed total net premiums written from our insurance business grew in and in premiums in were reduced by reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million related to hurricane katrina 
premiums in benefited from a million reduction of previously accrued reinsurance reinstatement premium costs 
premiums in the united states  which represent almost of our insurance premiums  grew by in and in insurance premiums outside the us grew in and in in local currencies  such growth was and in and  respectively 
the modest overall growth in net written premiums in our insurance business in both and reflected our continued emphasis on underwriting discipline in an increasingly competitive market environment 
rates were generally stable  but were under competitive pressure that varied by class of business and geographic territory 
in both years  we retained a high percentage of our existing customers and renewed these accounts at prices we believe to be appropriate relative to the exposure 
in addition  while we continued to be selective  we found opportunities to write new business at acceptable rates 
we expect to see a rate environment in for each of our business units similar to that we saw in accordingly  we expect that overall premiums in our insurance business will be flat in compared with  with low to mid single digit growth for personal insurance  flat premiums for commercial insurance and a modest decline in specialty insurance premiums 
net reinsurance assumed premiums written decreased by in and in premiums in included net reinstatement premium revenue of million related to hurricane katrina 
as discussed below  we sold our ongoing assumed reinsurance business to harbor point limited in december reinsurance ceded our premiums written are net of amounts ceded to reinsurers who assume a portion of the risk under the insurance policies we write that are subject to the reinsurance 
our overall ceded reinsurance premiums in were lower than those in during  we discontinued our professional liability per risk treaty 
underwriting actions we have taken in recent years have resulted in lower average limits on those large risks we write  which we believe made this treaty no longer economical 
on our casualty clash treaty  which operates like a catastrophe treaty  we increased our retention from million to million 
we did not renew a high excess surety per risk treaty as we believe the cost was not justified 
on our commercial property per risk treaty  our retention remained at million 
our property catastrophe treaty for events in the united states was modified to increase the coverage in the northeastern part of the country by million 
our property catastrophe treaty for events outside the united states was modified to increase our retention from million to million 
as a result of the substantial losses incurred by reinsurers from the catastrophes in and  the cost of property catastrophe reinsurance increased significantly in and there were capacity restrictions in the marketplace 
although property catastrophe reinsurance rates increased in  our overall ceded reinsurance premiums for our insurance business  excluding the impact of reinstatement premiums related to hurricane katrina  were only modestly higher than in due to modifications to certain of our reinsurance treaties 
on our casualty clash treaty  our initial retention remained at million 
we reduced our reinsurance coverage at the top of the program by million and increased our participation in the program 
this treaty now provides coverage of approximately of losses between million and million per insured event 
on our commercial property per risk treaty  we increased our retention from million to million 
this treaty now provides million of coverage per risk in excess of our retention 
our property catastrophe treaty for events in the united states was modified to increase our initial retention from million to million and to increase our participation in the program 
at the same time  we increased the reinsurance coverage in the northeastern part of the country by million  enhancing our protection in the region where we have our greatest concentration of exposure 
the treaty now provides coverage of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and billion  with additional coverage of of losses between billion and billion in the northeastern part of the country 
our property catastrophe treaty for events outside the united states was modified to increase our initial retention from million to million 
the treaty now provides coverage of approximately of losses net of recoveries from other available reinsurance between million and million 
our property reinsurance treaties generally contain terrorism exclusions for acts perpetrated by foreign terrorists 
we do not expect the changes we made to our reinsurance program during and to have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
our casualty clash treaty and our property reinsurance treaties expire on april  while we expect that reinsurance rates may rise somewhat in  particularly as they relate to property risks  the final structure and amount of coverage purchased will be determinants of our ceded reinsurance premium cost in we expect that the availability of reinsurance for certain coverages  such as terrorism  will continue to be very limited in most of our ceded reinsurance arrangements consist of excess of loss and catastrophe contracts that protect against a specified part or all of certain types of losses over stipulated amounts arising from any one occurrence or event 
therefore  unless we incur losses that exceed our initial retention under these contracts  we do not receive any loss recoveries 
as a result  in certain years  we cede premiums to other insurance companies and receive few  if any  loss recoveries 
however  in a year in which there is a significant catastrophic event such as hurricane katrina or a series of large individual losses  we may receive substantial loss recoveries 
the impact of ceded reinsurance on net premiums written and earned and on net losses and loss expenses incurred for the three years ended december  is presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
profitability the combined loss and expense ratio  expressed as a percentage  is the key measure of underwriting profitability traditionally used in the property and casualty insurance business 
management evaluates the performance of our underwriting operations and of each of our business units using  among other measures  the combined loss and expense ratio calculated in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
it is the sum of the ratio of losses and loss expenses to premiums earned loss ratio plus the ratio of statutory underwriting expenses to premiums written expense ratio after reducing both premium amounts by dividends to policyholders 
when the combined ratio is under  underwriting results are generally considered profitable  when the combined ratio is over  underwriting results are generally considered unprofitable 
statutory accounting principles applicable to property and casualty insurance companies differ in certain respects from generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
under statutory accounting principles  policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses are recognized immediately  not at the time premiums are earned 
management uses underwriting results determined in accordance with gaap  among other measures  to assess the overall performance of our underwriting operations 
to convert statutory underwriting results to a gaap basis  policy acquisition expenses are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
underwriting income determined in accordance with gaap is defined as premiums earned less losses incurred and gaap underwriting expenses incurred 
underwriting results in were exceptionally profitable compared with highly profitable results in and the combined loss and expense ratio for our overall property and casualty business was as follows years ended december loss ratio expense ratio combined loss and expense ratio the loss ratio was significantly lower in than in  reflecting the favorable loss experience resulting from our disciplined underwriting in recent years as well as lower catastrophe losses 
the loss ratio was modestly higher in than in due to higher catastrophe losses  primarily from hurricane katrina 
at the end of  we estimated that our net losses from hurricane katrina were million and our net reinsurance reinstatement premium costs related to the hurricane were million 
in our insurance business  estimated net losses were million and reinstatement premium costs were million  for an aggregate cost of million 
in our reinsurance assumed business  estimated net losses were million and net reinstatement premium revenue was million  for a net cost of million 
at the end of  we estimated that our gross losses from hurricane katrina were about billion 
almost all of the losses were from property exposure and business interruption claims 
our net losses of million were significantly lower than the gross amount due to a property per risk treaty that limited our net loss per risk and our property catastrophe treaty 
during  a large percentage of our claims from hurricane katrina were settled 
as a result  there were many adjustments  both favorable and unfavorable  to our loss estimates for individual claims related to this event 
these adjustments produced a reduction in our estimates for gross losses and reinsurance recoverable of and million  respectively  as well as a million reduction of previously accrued reinsurance reinstatement premium costs 
we still have over million of reinsurance available for this event under our catastrophe treaty if our gross losses are higher than our current estimate 
therefore  while it is possible that our estimate of ultimate losses related to hurricane katrina may change in the future  we do not expect that any such change would have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
other than the reinsurance recoverable related to hurricane katrina  we did not have any recoveries from our catastrophe reinsurance treaties during the three year period ended december  because there were no other individual catastrophes for which our losses exceeded our initial retention under the treaties 
our net catastrophe losses incurred in were million  which were offset in part by the million reduction in previously accrued reinsurance reinstatement premium costs related to hurricane katrina 
the net impact of catastrophes in accounted for percentage points of the loss ratio 
in  we incurred million of net catastrophe losses and million in related net reinsurance reinstatement premium costs  which in the aggregate accounted for percentage points of the loss ratio 
losses from catastrophes were million in  which represented percentage points of the loss ratio 
the catastrophe loss amount reflected an million reduction in loss reserves related to the september  attack  which reduced the loss ratio for the year by of a percentage point 
our expense ratio increased in as net premiums written decreased whereas compensation and other operating costs increased 
the decrease in the expense ratio in was due primarily to lower contingent commission expenses 
to a lesser extent  the decrease was due to flat overhead expenses compared with and the discontinuation of a professional liability per risk reinsurance treaty that resulted in an increase in net premiums written without a commensurate increase in expenses 
review of underwriting results by business unit personal insurance net premiums written from personal insurance  which represented of our premiums written in  increased by in both and net premiums written for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase increase vs 
vs 
dollars in millions automobile homeowners other total personal in and  premium growth was driven by our homeowners business 
the growth in our homeowners business in both years was due to increased insurance to value and  to a lesser extent  modestly higher rates 
the in force policy count for this class of business had minimal growth in both years 
homeowners premiums in were reduced by reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million related to hurricane katrina 
premium growth in our personal automobile business in and was due to selective initiatives outside the united states 
premiums in the us declined in both years due to our maintaining underwriting discipline in an increasingly competitive marketplace 
growth in our other personal business  which includes insurance for excess liability  yacht and accident coverages  was similar in both years 
our personal insurance business produced profitable underwriting results in each of the last three years 
overall results have shown substantial improvement in each succeeding year  driven largely by our homeowners results 
the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within the personal insurance segment were as follows years ended december automobile homeowners other total personal our personal automobile results were profitable in each of the past three years 
results in were more profitable than in due to lower claim frequency and favorable loss development related to prior accident years 
results in were slightly less profitable than in due to reserve strengthening in the liability component related to prior accident years 
homeowners results were profitable in each of the last three years 
results improved significantly in and again in the improvement was largely the result of better pricing and a reduction in water damage losses primarily through contract wording changes related to mold coverage and loss remediation measures that we have implemented over the past few years as well as lower catastrophe losses 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in and percentage points in other personal business produced profitable results in each of the past three years 
results in were less profitable than those in and our excess liability business has deteriorated in each of the past two years due to inadequate pricing and unfavorable loss development related to prior accident years 
our yacht business was highly profitable in compared with unprofitable results in and our accident business was highly profitable in all three years 
commercial insurance net premiums written from commercial insurance  which represented of our premiums written in  increased by in both and net premiums written for the classes of business within the commercial insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase increase decrease decrease vs 
vs 
dollars in millions multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial growth in our commercial classes in and was limited due to a competitive marketplace 
rates were generally stable but were under competitive pressure in some classes of business  particularly non catastrophe exposed property risks and certain casualty risks 
multiple peril and property and marine premiums in were reduced by reinsurance reinstatement premium costs of million and million  respectively  related to hurricane katrina 
in  property and marine premiums benefited from a million reduction of previously accrued reinsurance reinstatement premium costs 
excluding the reinsurance reinstatement premiums  multiple peril premiums declined in and were flat in compared with the respective prior years and property and marine premiums grew in both and retention levels of our existing customers remained steady over the last three years 
new business volume was slightly higher in compared with  with the increase coming from outside the us new business volume in was significantly lower than in due to decreased submission activity  which was the result of our competitors working to retain their better accounts 
we have continued to maintain our underwriting discipline in the competitive market  renewing business and writing new business only where we believe we are securing acceptable rates and appropriate terms and conditions for the exposures 
our commercial insurance business produced profitable underwriting results in each of the past three years  particularly in and these profitable results were due in large part to the cumulative effect of price increases in prior years  better terms and conditions and more stringent risk selection 
results in each year also benefited from low non catastrophe property losses 
results in were less profitable than in and  largely due to substantially higher catastrophe losses  primarily from hurricane katrina 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for our commercial insurance business in whereas such impact was negligible in and the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within commercial insurance were as follows years ended december multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial multiple peril results were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
results in were less profitable than in and largely due to higher catastrophe losses 
the impact of catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio for this class in compared with percentage points in catastrophe losses were negligible for this class in due to a million reduction in net loss reserves related to the september  attack 
the property component of this business benefited from low non catastrophe losses in all three years 
results in the liability component improved in and again in results for our casualty business were less profitable in and compared with the highly profitable results in the automobile component of our casualty business was highly profitable in each of the past three years 
results in the primary liability component were less profitable in each succeeding year 
results in the excess liability component were unprofitable in and compared with profitable results in results in for this component benefited from a million reduction in net loss reserves related to the september  attack 
in and  excess liability results and  to a lesser extent  primary liability results were adversely affected by unfavorable loss development related to older accident years 
workers compensation results were highly profitable in each of the past three years 
results were more profitable in each succeeding year due to favorable claim cost trends 
results in all three years benefited from our disciplined risk selection during the past several years 
property and marine results were highly profitable in and compared with marginally profitable results in the less profitable results in were due to substantially higher catastrophe losses  primarily from hurricane katrina 
results in each year benefited from relatively few large non catastrophe losses 
the impact of catastrophes was negligible in catastrophes accounted for percentage points of the combined loss and expense ratio in and percentage points in the impact of catastrophes in reflects a million reduction in net loss reserves related to the september  attack 
specialty insurance net premiums written from specialty insurance  which represented of our premiums written in  decreased by in compared with a increase in net premiums written for the classes of business within the specialty insurance segment were as follows years ended december increase decrease increase vs 
vs 
dollars in millions professional liability surety total specialty growth in net premiums written for the professional liability classes of business was constrained in both and by the continued competitive pressure on rates that began in the latter half of and our commitment to maintain underwriting discipline in this environment 
growth in both years was also dampened by the sale of renewal rights  effective july   on our hospital medical malpractice and managed care errors and omissions business 
the net premium growth in in the professional liability classes was due to the non renewal of a per risk reinsurance treaty 
rates were generally stable in and for most professional liability classes but were lower in the for profit directors and officers liability component 
retention levels remained strong over the last three years 
new business volume declined in each of the past two years due to the increased competition in the marketplace and  in  our exiting the hospital medical malpractice and managed care errors and omissions business 
we continued to get what we believe are acceptable rates and appropriate terms and conditions on both new business and renewals 
in line with our strategy in recent years of directing our focus to small and middle market publicly traded and privately held companies  the percentage of our book of business represented by large public companies has decreased 
the growth in net premiums written for our surety business was substantial in both and about half of the growth in both years was due to the non renewal of a high excess reinsurance treaty during our specialty insurance business produced highly profitable underwriting results in compared with modestly profitable results in and unprofitable results in the combined loss and expense ratios for the classes of business within specialty insurance were as follows years ended december professional liability surety total specialty our professional liability business improved substantially in and again in  producing profitable results in compared with near breakeven results in and highly unprofitable results in the fidelity component of our professional liability business was highly profitable in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience 
the results of the directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and fiduciary liability components improved in and again in  benefiting from the cumulative effect of price increases in prior years  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions 
results in also benefited from modest favorable loss development related to prior accident years 
conversely  results in and  but more so in  were adversely affected by unfavorable loss development related to accident years prior to this adverse development was predominantly from claims that have arisen due to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities 
adverse development was particularly significant in due to an increase of about million in errors and omissions liability loss reserves in the second quarter related to investment banks 
our surety business produced highly profitable results in each of the past three years due to favorable loss experience 
our surety business tends to be characterized by infrequent but potentially high severity losses 
we continue to manage our exposure on an absolute basis and by specific bond type 
the majority of our obligations are intended to be performance based guarantees 
when losses occur  they are mitigated  at times  by the customer s balance sheet  contract payments  collateral and bankruptcy recoveries 
we continue to have substantial commercial and construction surety exposure for current and prior customers  including exposures related to surety bonds issued on behalf of companies that have experienced deterioration in creditworthiness since we issued bonds to them 
we therefore may experience an increase in filed claims and may incur high severity losses 
such losses would be recognized if and when claims are filed and determined to be valid  and could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations and liquidity 
reinsurance assumed in december  we completed a transaction involving a new bermuda based reinsurance company  harbor point limited 
as part of the transaction  we transferred our continuing reinsurance assumed business and certain related assets  including renewal rights  to harbor point 
harbor point generally did not assume our reinsurance liabilities relating to reinsurance contracts incepting prior to december  we retained those liabilities and the related assets 
other than pursuant to certain arrangements entered into with harbor point  we generally no longer engage directly in the reinsurance assumed business 
however  harbor point has the right for a transition period of up to two years to underwrite specific reinsurance business on our behalf 
we retain a portion of any such business and cede the balance to harbor point in return for a fronting commission 
we will receive additional payments based on the amount of business renewed by harbor point  which will be recognized when earned 
net premiums written from our reinsurance assumed business  which represented of our premiums written in  decreased by in and in the significant decrease in premiums in was expected in light of the sale of our continuing reinsurance assumed business to harbor point 
the decrease in premiums in was in line with our expectations as we had anticipated fewer attractive opportunities in the reinsurance market 
premiums in included net reinsurance reinstatement premium revenue of million related to hurricane katrina 
our reinsurance assumed business was profitable in  and results in were particularly profitable 
while the volume of business was substantially lower than in the previous two years  results in benefited from significant favorable loss development related to prior accident years 
results in were similar to those in despite higher catastrophe losses 
regulatory developments to promote and distribute our insurance products  we rely on independent brokers and agents 
accordingly  our business is dependent on the willingness of these brokers and agents to recommend our products to their customers 
prior to  we had agreements in place with certain insurance agents and brokers under which  in addition to the standard commissions that we pay  we agreed to pay commissions that were contingent on the volume and or the profitability of business placed with us 
we have been involved in the ongoing investigations of certain business practices in the property and casualty insurance industry by various attorneys general and other regulatory authorities of several states  the us securities and exchange commission  the us attorney for the southern district of new york and certain non us regulatory authorities with respect to  among other things  potential conflicts of interest and anti competitive behavior arising from the payment of contingent commissions to brokers and agents and loss mitigation and finite reinsurance arrangements 
in connection with these investigations  we have received subpoenas and other requests for information from various regulators 
we have been cooperating fully with these investigations 
although no regulatory action has been initiated against us  it is possible that one or more regulatory authorities will bring an action against us with respect to some or all of the issues that are the focus of these ongoing investigations 
on december   we entered into an assurance of discontinuance with the attorneys general of new york  connecticut and illinois  resolving all issues arising out of those officials investigations of the market practices described above 
as part of this agreement  we agreed to contribute million to a settlement fund established for the benefit of certain customers 
we also agreed to pay million to help defray the costs of the investigations by the attorneys general 
in addition  we agreed to implement certain business reforms  including discontinuing the payment of contingent commissions in the united states on all insurance lines beginning in the settlement did not require that we pay a fine or penalty 
in lieu of paying contingent commissions  we will pay  beginning in  guaranteed supplemental compensation to all agents and brokers with whom we previously had contingent commission agreements 
under this arrangement  agents and brokers will be paid a percentage of written premiums on eligible lines of business in a calendar year based upon their prior performance 
we do not believe that our payment of guaranteed supplemental compensation in lieu of contingent commissions or any of the other business reforms that we are implementing will have a material adverse effect on the corporation s business  results of operations or financial condition 
chubb and certain of its subsidiaries have been named in legal proceedings brought by private plaintiffs arising out of the investigations into the payment of contingent commissions to brokers and agents 
these legal proceedings are further described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we cannot predict at this time the ultimate outcome of the ongoing investigations and legal proceedings referred to above  including any potential amounts that we may be required to pay in connection with them 
a number of states have announced that they are looking at compensation arrangements in the insurance industry and are considering regulatory action or reform in this area 
such actions or reforms range in nature from disclosure requirements to prohibition of certain forms of compensation to imposition of new duties on agents  brokers or insurance companies in dealing with customers 
such actions or reforms  if adopted  could have an impact on our ability to renew business or write new business 
catastrophe risk management our property and casualty subsidiaries have exposure to losses caused by natural perils such as hurricanes and other windstorms  earthquakes  winter storms and brush fires and from man made catastrophic events such as terrorism 
the frequency and severity of catastrophes are unpredictable 
natural catastrophes the extent of losses from a natural catastrophe is a function of both the total amount of insured exposure in an area affected by the event and the severity of the event 
we regularly assess our concentration of risk exposures in catastrophe exposed areas globally and have strategies and underwriting standards to manage this exposure through individual risk selection  subject to regulatory constraints  and through the purchase of catastrophe reinsurance 
we have invested in modeling technologies and a risk concentration management tool that allow us to monitor and control our accumulations of potential losses in catastrophe exposed areas in the united states  such as california and the gulf and east coasts  as well as in such areas in other countries 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
we also continue to actively explore and analyze credible scientific evidence  including the impact of global climate change  that may affect our ability to manage exposure under the insurance policies we issue 
despite these efforts  the occurrence of one or more severe natural catastrophic events in heavily populated areas could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
terrorism risk and legislation the september  attack changed the way the property and casualty insurance industry views catastrophic risk 
that tragic event demonstrated that numerous classes of business we write are subject to terrorism related catastrophic risks in addition to the catastrophic risks related to natural occurrences 
this  together with the limited availability of terrorism reinsurance  has required us to change how we identify and evaluate risk accumulations 
we have licensed a terrorism model that provides loss estimates under numerous event scenarios 
also  the above noted risk concentration management tool enables us to identify locations and geographic areas that are exposed to risk accumulations 
the information provided by the model and the tracking tool has resulted in our non renewing some accounts and has restricted us from writing others 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by the model 
the terrorism risk insurance act of tria established a temporary program under which the federal government will share the risk of loss from certain acts of international terrorism with the insurance industry 
the program  which was applicable to most lines of commercial business  was scheduled to terminate on december  in december  the federal government extended tria through december  under the terms of the amended law  certain lines of business previously subject to the provisions of tria  including commercial automobile  surety and professional liability insurance  other than directors and officers liability  are excluded from the program 
as a precondition to recovery under tria  insurance companies with direct commercial insurance exposure in the united states for tria lines of business are required to make insurance for covered acts of terrorism available under their policies 
each insurer has a separate deductible that it must meet in the event of an act of terrorism before federal assistance becomes available 
the deductible is based on a percentage of direct us earned premiums for the covered lines of business in the previous calendar year 
for  that deductible is of direct premiums earned in for these lines of business 
for losses above the deductible  the federal government will pay for of covered losses  while the insurer retains 
there is a combined annual aggregate limit for the federal government and all insurers of billion 
if acts of terrorism result in covered losses exceeding the billion annual limit  insurers are not liable for additional losses 
while the provisions of tria will serve to mitigate our exposure in the event of a large scale terrorist attack  our deductible is substantial  approximating billion in for certain classes of business  such as workers compensation  terrorism insurance is mandatory 
for those classes of business where it is not mandatory  policyholders may choose not to accept terrorism insurance  which would  subject to other statutory or regulatory restrictions  reduce our exposure 
it is unclear at this time whether congress will reauthorize tria for periods subsequent to december  regardless of whether or not tria is extended  we will continue to manage this type of catastrophic risk by monitoring terrorism risk aggregations 
nevertheless  given the unpredictability of the targets  frequency and severity of potential terrorist events as well as the very limited terrorism reinsurance coverage available in the market  the occurrence of any such events could have a material adverse effect on the corporation s results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
we also have exposure outside the united states to risk of loss from acts of terrorism 
in some jurisdictions  we have access to government mechanisms that would mitigate our exposure 
loss reserves unpaid losses and loss expenses  also referred to as loss reserves  are the largest liability of our property and casualty subsidiaries 
our loss reserves include case estimates for claims that have been reported and estimates for claims that have been incurred but not reported as well as estimates of the expenses associated with processing and settling all reported and unreported claims  less estimates of anticipated salvage and subrogation recoveries 
estimates are based upon past loss experience modified for current trends as well as prevailing economic  legal and social conditions 
our loss reserves are not discounted to present value 
we regularly review our loss reserves using a variety of actuarial techniques 
we update the reserve estimates as historical loss experience develops  additional claims are reported and or settled and new information becomes available 
any changes in estimates are reflected in operating results in the period in which the estimates are changed 
our gross case and incurred but not reported ibnr loss reserves and related reinsurance recoverable by class of business were as follows gross loss reserves reinsurance net loss december  case ibnr total recoverable reserves in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance professional liability surety total specialty total insurance reinsurance assumed total gross loss reserves reinsurance net loss december  case ibnr total recoverable reserves in millions personal insurance automobile homeowners other total personal commercial insurance multiple peril casualty workers compensation property and marine total commercial specialty insurance professional liability surety total specialty total insurance reinsurance assumed total loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  increased by billion or in the most significant increases occurred in the commercial casualty  workers compensation and professional liability classes of business 
the decreases in gross loss reserves and reinsurance recoverable during in the property and marine  multiple peril and homeowners classes were due to payments and reductions in our loss estimates related to hurricane katrina 
the decrease in reinsurance recoverable in the professional liability classes was due primarily to significant recoveries related to older accident years and the discontinuation of the per risk treaty in in establishing the loss reserves of our property and casualty subsidiaries  we consider facts currently known and the present state of the law and coverage litigation 
based on all information currently available  we believe that the aggregate loss reserves at december  were adequate to cover claims for losses that had occurred as of that date  including both those known to us and those yet to be reported 
however  as described below  there are significant uncertainties inherent in the loss reserving process 
it is therefore possible that management s estimate of the ultimate liability for losses that had occurred as of december  may change  which could have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations and financial condition 
estimates and uncertainties the process of establishing loss reserves is complex and imprecise as it must take into consideration many variables that are subject to the outcome of future events 
as a result  informed subjective estimates and judgments as to our ultimate exposure to losses are an integral component of our loss reserving process 
due to the inherent complexity of the loss reserving process and the potential variability of the assumptions used  the actual emergence of losses could vary  perhaps substantially  from the estimate of losses included in our financial statements  particularly when settlements may not occur until well into the future 
our net loss reserves at december  were billion 
therefore  a relatively small percentage change in the estimate of net loss reserves would have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations 
reserves other than those relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
our loss reserves include amounts related to short tail and long tail classes of business 
tail refers to the time period between the occurrence of a loss and the settlement of the claim 
the longer the time span between the incidence of a loss and the settlement of the claim  the more the ultimate settlement amount can vary 
short tail classes consist principally of homeowners  commercial property and marine business 
for these classes  the estimation of loss reserves is less complex because claims are generally reported and settled shortly after the loss occurs and the claims relate to tangible property 
most of our loss reserves relate to long tail liability classes of business 
long tail classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and other professional liability coverages  commercial primary and excess liability  workers compensation and other liability coverages 
for many liability claims significant periods of time  ranging up to several years or more  may elapse between the occurrence of the loss  the reporting of the loss to us and the settlement of the claim 
as a result  loss experience in the more recent accident years for the long tail liability classes has limited statistical credibility because a relatively small proportion of losses in these accident years are reported claims and an even smaller proportion are paid losses 
an accident year is the calendar year in which a loss is incurred or  in the case of claims made policies  the calendar year in which a loss is reported 
liability claims are also more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretations and the legal environment 
consequently  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and typically subject to a higher degree of variability than for short tail classes 
most of our reinsurance assumed business is long tailed casualty reinsurance 
reserve estimates for this business are therefore subject to the variability caused by extended loss emergence periods 
the estimation of loss reserves for this business is further complicated by delays between the time the claim is reported to the ceding insurer and when it is reported by the ceding insurer to us and by our dependence on the quality and consistency of the loss reporting by the ceding company 
our actuaries perform a comprehensive annual review of loss reserves for each of the numerous classes of business we write prior to the determination of the year end carried reserves 
the review process takes into consideration the variety of trends that impact the ultimate settlement of claims in each particular class of business 
a similar  but somewhat less comprehensive  review is performed for the major classes of business prior to the determination of the june carried reserves 
at the end of the first and third quarters  our actuaries review the emergence of paid and reported losses relative to expectations and  as necessary  conduct reserve reviews for particular classes of business 
the loss reserve estimation process relies on the basic assumption that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and likely trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future outcomes 
as part of that process  our actuaries use a variety of actuarial methods that analyze experience  trends and other relevant factors 
the principal standard actuarial methods used by our actuaries in the loss reserve reviews include loss development factor methods  expected loss ratio methods  bornheutter ferguson methods and frequency severity methods 
loss development factor methods generally assume that the losses yet to emerge for an accident year are proportional to the paid or reported loss amount observed so far 
reported losses include cumulative paid losses plus case reserves 
historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses by accident year are applied to current paid and reported losses to generate estimated ultimate losses by accident year 
expected loss ratio methods use loss ratios for prior accident years  adjusted to reflect our evaluation of recent loss trends  the current risk environment  changes in our book of business and changes in our pricing and underwriting  to determine the appropriate expected loss ratio for a given accident year 
the accident year expected loss ratio is multiplied by the calendar year earned premiums to calculate estimated ultimate losses 
bornheutter ferguson methods are combinations of an expected loss ratio method and a loss development factor method  where the loss development factor method is given more weight as an accident year matures 
frequency severity methods first project ultimate claim counts using one or more of the other methods described above and then multiply those counts by an estimated average claim cost to estimate ultimate losses 
the average claims costs are often estimated by fitting historical severity data to an observed trend 
using the various actuarial methods  our actuaries estimate the ultimate cost of all claims by accident year for each class of business 
from this amount  cumulative paid losses and loss expenses and case reserves are subtracted to estimate the ibnr reserve for each class of business 
the ibnr reserve includes a provision for claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported to us  some of which are not yet known to the insured  as well as a provision for future development on reported claims 
a relatively large proportion of our net loss reserves  particularly for long tail liability classes  are reserves for ibnr losses 
in fact  more than of our aggregate net loss reserves at december  were for ibnr losses 
in completing their loss reserve analysis  our actuaries are required to determine the most appropriate actuarial methods to employ for each class of business 
within each class  the business is further segregated by accident year and generally by jurisdiction 
each estimation method has its own pattern  parameter and or judgmental dependencies  with no estimation method being better than the others in all situations 
the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various estimation methods can also change over time 
in many cases  multiple estimation methods will be valid for the particular facts and circumstances of the relevant class of business 
the manner of application and the degree of reliance on a given method will vary by class of business  by accident year and by jurisdiction based on our actuaries evaluation of the above dependencies and the potential volatility of the loss frequency and severity patterns 
the estimation methods selected or given weight by our actuaries at a particular valuation date are those that are believed to produce the most reliable indication for the loss reserves being evaluated 
these selections incorporate input from claims personnel  pricing actuaries and underwriting management on loss cost trends and other factors that could affect the reserve estimates 
for short tail classes  the emergence of paid and incurred losses is likely indicative of ultimate losses 
for these classes  the loss development factor method is generally relatively straightforward to apply and usually requires only modest extrapolation 
for long tail classes  applying the loss development factor method often requires more judgment in selecting development factors as well as more significant extrapolation 
for those long tail classes with high frequency and relatively low per loss severity eg workers compensation  volatility will often be sufficiently modest for the loss development factor method to be given significant weight  except in the most recent accident years 
for certain long tail classes of business  however  anticipated loss experience is less predictable because of the small number of claims and or erratic claim severity patterns 
these classes include directors and officers liability  errors and omissions liability and commercial excess liability  among others 
for these classes  the actuarial estimates for the most recent accident years are based on less extrapolatory methods  such as expected loss ratio and bornheutter ferguson methods 
over time  as a greater number of claims are reported and the statistical credibility of loss experience increases  loss development factor methods are given increasingly more weight 
using all the available data  our actuaries select an indicated loss reserve amount for each class of business based on the various assumptions  projections and methods 
the total indicated reserve amount determined by our actuaries is an aggregate of the indicated reserve amounts for the individual classes of business 
the ultimate outcome is likely to fall within a range of potential outcomes around this indicated amount  but the indicated amount is not expected to be precisely the ultimate liability 
senior management meets with the actuaries at the end of each quarter to review the results of the latest loss reserve analysis 
based on this review  management determines the carried reserve for each class of business 
in making the determination  management considers numerous factors  such as changes in actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past and the level of volatility within a particular class of business 
such an assessment requires considerable judgment 
it is often not possible to determine whether a change in the data represents credible actionable information or an anomaly 
even if a change is determined to be permanent  it is not always possible to determine the extent of the change until sometime later 
as a result  there can be a time lag between the emergence of a change and a determination that the change should be reflected in the carried loss reserves 
in general  changes are made more quickly to more mature accident years and less volatile classes of business 
among the numerous factors that contribute to the inherent uncertainty in the process of establishing loss reserves are the following changes in the inflation rate for goods and services related to covered damages such as medical care and home repair costs  changes in the judicial interpretation of policy provisions relating to the determination of coverage  changes in the general attitude of juries in the determination of liability and damages  legislative actions  changes in the medical condition of claimants  changes in our estimates of the number and or severity of claims that have been incurred but not reported as of the date of the financial statements  changes in our book of business  changes in our underwriting standards  and changes in our claim handling procedures 
in addition  we must consider the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues that arise as legal  judicial and social conditions change 
these issues can have a negative effect on our loss reserves by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
recent examples of such issues include the number of directors and officers liability claims arising out of stock option backdating practices by certain public companies  the number and size of directors and officers liability and errors and omissions liability claims arising out of investment banking practices and accounting and other corporate malfeasance  and exposure to claims asserted for bodily injury as a result of long term exposure to harmful products or substances 
as a result of issues such as these  the uncertainties inherent in estimating ultimate claim costs on the basis of past experience have grown  further complicating the already complex loss reserving process 
as part of our loss reserving analysis  we take into consideration the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process 
those factors that could materially affect our loss reserve estimates include loss development patterns and loss cost trends  rate and exposure level changes  the effects of changes in coverage and policy limits  re underwriting efforts and business mix shifts  the effects of regulatory and legislative developments  the effects of changes in judicial interpretations  the effects of emerging claims and coverage issues  and the effects of changes in claim handling practices 
in making estimates of reserves  however  we do not necessarily make an explicit assumption for each of these factors 
moreover  all estimation methods do not utilize the same assumptions and typically no single method is determinative in the reserve analysis for a class of business 
consequently  changes in our loss reserve estimates generally are not the result of changes in any one assumption 
instead  the variability will be affected by the interplay of changes in multiple assumptions  many of which are implicit to the approaches used 
for each class of business  we regularly adjust the assumptions and actuarial methods used in the estimation of loss reserves in response to our actual loss experience as well as our judgments regarding changes in trends and or emerging patterns 
in those instances where we primarily utilize analyses of historical patterns of the development of paid and reported losses  this may be reflected  for example  in the selection of revised loss development factors 
in those long tail classes of business professional liability and commercial casualty that comprise a majority of our loss reserves and for which loss experience is less predictable due to potential changes in judicial interpretations  potential legislative actions and potential claims issues  this may be reflected in a judgmental change in our estimate of ultimate losses for particular accident years 
the future impact of the various factors that contribute to the uncertainty in the loss reserving process is extremely difficult to predict 
there is potential for significant variation in the development of loss reserves  particularly for long tail classes of business 
we do not derive statistical loss distributions or outcome confidence levels around our loss reserve estimate 
actuarial ranges of reasonable estimates are not a true reflection of the potential volatility between carried loss reserves and the ultimate settlement amount of losses incurred prior to the balance sheet date 
this is due  among other reasons  to the fact that actuarial ranges are developed based on known events as of the valuation date whereas the ultimate disposition of losses is subject to the outcome of events and circumstances that were unknown as of the valuation date 
the following discussion includes disclosure of possible variation from current estimates of loss reserves due to a change in certain key assumptions for particular classes of business 
these impacts are estimated individually  without consideration for any correlation among such assumptions or among lines of business 
therefore  it would be inappropriate to take the amounts and add them together in an attempt to estimate volatility for our loss reserves in total 
we believe that the estimated variation in reserves detailed below is a reasonable estimate of the possible variation that may occur in the future 
however  if such variation did occur  it would likely occur over a period of several years and therefore its impact on the corporation s results of operations would be spread over the same period 
it is important to note  however  that there is the potential for future variation greater than the amounts discussed below 
two of the larger components of our loss reserves relate to the professional liability classes other than fidelity and commercial excess liability 
the respective reported loss development patterns are key assumptions in estimating loss reserves for these classes of business  both as applied directly to more mature accident years and as applied indirectly eg  via bornheutter ferguson methods to less mature accident years 
reserves for the professional liability classes other than fidelity were billion  net of reinsurance  at december  based on a review of our loss experience  if the loss development factor for each accident year changed such that the cumulative loss development factor for the most recent accident year changed by  we estimate that the net reserves for the professional liability classes other than fidelity would change by approximately million  in either direction 
this degree of change in the reported loss development pattern is within the historical variation around the averages in our data 
reserves for commercial excess liability excluding asbestos and toxic waste claims were billion  net of reinsurance  at december  these reserves are included within commercial casualty 
based on a review of our loss experience  if the loss development factor for each accident year changed such that the cumulative loss development factor for the most recent accident year changed by  we estimate that the net reserves for commercial excess liability would change by approximately million  in either direction 
this degree of change in the reported loss development pattern is within the historical variation around the averages in our data 
reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the estimation of loss reserves relating to asbestos and toxic waste claims on insurance policies written many years ago is subject to greater uncertainty than other types of claims due to inconsistent court decisions as well as judicial interpretations and legislative actions that in some cases have tended to broaden coverage beyond the original intent of such policies and in others have expanded theories of liability 
the insurance industry as a whole is engaged in extensive litigation over coverage and liability issues and is thus confronted with a continuing uncertainty in its efforts to quantify these exposures 
reserves for asbestos and toxic waste claims cannot be estimated with traditional actuarial loss reserving techniques that rely on historical accident year loss development factors 
instead  we rely on an exposure based analysis that involves a detailed review of individual policy terms and exposures 
because each policyholder presents different liability and coverage issues  we generally evaluate our exposure on a policyholder by policyholder basis  considering a variety of factors that are unique to each policyholder 
quantitative techniques have to be supplemented by subjective considerations including management s judgment 
we establish case reserves and expense reserves for costs of related litigation where sufficient information has been developed to indicate the involvement of a specific insurance policy 
in addition  ibnr reserves are established to cover additional exposures on both known and unasserted claims 
we believe that the loss reserves carried at december  for asbestos and toxic waste claims were adequate 
however  given the judicial decisions and legislative actions that have broadened the scope of coverage and expanded theories of liability in the past and the possibilities of similar interpretations in the future  it is possible that our estimate of loss reserves relating to these exposures may increase in future periods as new information becomes available and as claims develop 
asbestos reserves 
asbestos remains the most significant and difficult mass tort for the insurance industry in terms of claims volume and dollar exposure 
asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by those who came in contact with asbestos or products containing asbestos 
until recently  judicial interpretations and legislative actions attempted to maximize insurance availability from both a coverage and liability standpoint 
early court cases established the continuous trigger theory with respect to insurance coverage 
under this theory  insurance coverage is deemed to be triggered from the time a claimant is first exposed to asbestos until the manifestation of any disease 
this interpretation of a policy trigger can involve insurance companies over many years and increases their exposure to liability 
new asbestos claims and new exposures on existing claims have continued despite the fact that usage of asbestos has declined since the mid s 
each claim filing typically names dozens of defendants 
the plaintiffs bar has solicited new claimants through extensive advertising and through asbestos medical screenings 
a vast majority of asbestos bodily injury claims have been filed by claimants who do not show any signs of asbestos related disease 
new asbestos cases are often filed in those jurisdictions with a reputation for judges and juries that are extremely sympathetic to plaintiffs 
approximately manufacturers and distributors of asbestos products have filed for bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities 
a bankruptcy sometimes involves an agreement to a plan between the debtor and its creditors  including current and future asbestos claimants 
although the debtor is negotiating in part with its insurers money  insurers are generally given only limited opportunity to be heard 
in addition to contributing to the overall number of claims  bankruptcy proceedings have also caused increased settlement demands against remaining solvent defendants 
there have been several recent positive events in the asbestos environment various challenges to mass screening claimants have been mounted  including a june us district court decision in texas 
many believe that this decision is leading to higher medical evidentiary standards 
for example  several asbestos injury settlement trusts have refused new claims that were based on the diagnosis of physicians or screening companies named in the case  citing questions regarding their reliability 
further investigations of the medical screening process for asbestos claims are underway 
a number of states have implemented legislative and judicial reforms that focus the courts attention on the claims of the most seriously injured 
legislation that sets medical criteria that must be met for plaintiffs to proceed with their claims has been enacted in several states and is pending in others 
similarly  judicial reforms such as inactive dockets  which preserve the right to sue for those who do not currently meet the specific medical criteria  have been established in several jurisdictions 
a number of key jurisdictions have adopted venue reform that requires plaintiffs to have a connection to the jurisdiction in order to file a complaint 
in recognition that many aspects of bankruptcy plans are unfair to certain classes of claimants and to the insurance industry  these plans are beginning to be closely scrutinized by the courts and rejected when appropriate 
our most significant individual asbestos exposures involve products liability on the part of traditional defendants who were engaged in the manufacture  distribution or installation of asbestos products 
we wrote excess liability and or general liability coverages for these insureds 
while these insureds are relatively few in number  their exposure has become substantial due to the increased volume of claims  the erosion of the underlying limits and the bankruptcies of target defendants 
our other asbestos exposures involve products and non products liability on the part of peripheral defendants  including a mix of manufacturers  distributors and installers of certain products that contain asbestos in small quantities and owners or operators of properties where asbestos was present 
generally  these insureds are named defendants on a regional rather than a nationwide basis 
as the financial resources of traditional asbestos defendants have been depleted  plaintiffs are targeting these viable peripheral parties with greater frequency and  in many cases  for larger awards 
asbestos claims against the major manufacturers  distributors or installers of asbestos products were typically presented under the products liability section of primary general liability policies as well as under excess liability policies  both of which typically had aggregate limits that capped an insurer s exposure 
in recent years  a number of asbestos claims by insureds are being presented as non products claims  such as those by installers of asbestos products and by property owners or operators who allegedly had asbestos on their property  under the premises or operations section of primary general liability policies 
unlike products exposures  these non products exposures typically had no aggregate limits on coverage  creating potentially greater exposure 
further  in an effort to seek additional insurance coverage  some insureds with installation activities who have substantially eroded their products coverage are presenting new asbestos claims as non products operations claims or attempting to reclassify previously settled products claims as non products claims to restore a portion of previously exhausted products aggregate limits 
it is difficult to predict whether insureds will be successful in asserting claims under non products coverage or whether insurers will be successful in asserting additional defenses 
accordingly  the ultimate cost to insurers of the claims for coverage not subject to aggregate limits is uncertain 
in establishing our asbestos reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the available insurance coverage  limits and deductibles  the jurisdictions involved  past settlement values of similar claims  the potential role of other insurance  particularly underlying coverage below our excess liability policies  potential bankruptcy impact  and applicable coverage defenses  including asbestos exclusions 
we have assumed a continuing unfavorable legal environment with no benefit from any federal asbestos reform legislation 
proposed legislation that would have created a billion asbestos trust fund but would have provided neither certainty nor finality was not adopted and the future of federal legislation remains uncertain 
our actuaries and claim personnel perform periodic analyses of our asbestos related exposures 
the analyses during noted that both the number of peripheral asbestos defendants for whom we established reserves and the average severity of these claims were somewhat higher than expected 
in addition  there was an increase in our estimate of the ultimate liabilities for one of our traditional asbestos defendants 
the analyses during noted an increase in our estimate of the ultimate liabilities for two of our asbestos defendants 
the analyses during noted positive developments  including several settlements  related to certain of our traditional asbestos defendants 
at the same time  the analyses indicated that our exposure to loss from claims against our peripheral defendants was somewhat higher than previously expected 
based on these analyses  which were supported by our outside actuarial consultants  we increased our net asbestos loss reserves by million in  million in and million in the following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending loss reserves related to asbestos claims 
years ended december in millions gross loss reserves  beginning of year reinsurance recoverable  beginning of year net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses net losses paid net loss reserves  end of year reinsurance recoverable  end of year gross loss reserves  end of year the following table presents the number of policyholders for whom we have open asbestos case reserves and the related net loss reserves at december  as well as the net losses paid during by component 
number of net loss net losses policyholders reserves paid in millions traditional defendants peripheral defendants future claims from unknown policyholders significant uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability related to asbestos related claims 
this uncertainty is due to several factors including the long latency period between asbestos exposure and disease manifestation and the resulting potential for involvement of multiple policy periods for individual claims  plaintiffs increased focus on peripheral defendants  the volume of claims by unimpaired plaintiffs and the extent to which they can be precluded from making claims  the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage not subject to aggregate limits  the number of insureds seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos related liabilities  the ability of claimants to bring a claim in a state in which they have no residency or exposure  the impact of the exhaustion of primary limits and the resulting increase in claims on excess liability policies we have issued  inconsistent court decisions and diverging legal interpretations  and the possibility  however remote  of federal legislation that would address the asbestos problem 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved in the near future 
while there have been some positive legislative and judicial developments in the asbestos arena over the past three years  it is too early to call it a trend 
toxic waste reserves 
toxic waste claims relate primarily to pollution and related cleanup costs 
our insureds have two potential areas of exposure hazardous waste dump sites and pollution at the insured site primarily from underground storage tanks and manufacturing processes 
the federal comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund has been interpreted to impose strict  retroactive and joint and several liability on potentially responsible parties prps for the cost of remediating hazardous waste sites 
most sites have multiple prps 
most prps named to date are parties who have been generators  transporters  past or present landowners or past or present site operators 
these prps had proper government authorization in many instances 
however  relative fault has not been a factor in establishing liability 
insurance policies issued to prps were not intended to cover the clean up costs of pollution and  in many cases  did not intend to cover the pollution itself 
in more recent years  however  policies specifically excluded such exposures 
as the costs of environmental clean up became substantial  prps and others increasingly filed claims with their insurance carriers 
litigation against insurers extends to issues of liability  coverage and other policy provisions 
there is substantial uncertainty involved in estimating our liabilities related to these claims 
first  the liabilities of the claimants are extremely difficult to estimate 
at any given waste site  the allocation of remediation costs among governmental authorities and the prps varies greatly depending on a variety of factors 
second  different courts have addressed liability and coverage issues regarding pollution claims and have reached inconsistent conclusions in their interpretation of several issues 
these significant uncertainties are not likely to be resolved definitively in the near future 
uncertainties also remain as to the superfund law itself 
superfund s taxing authority expired on december  and has not been re enacted 
federal legislation appears to be at a standstill 
at this time  it is not possible to predict the direction that any reforms may take  when they may occur or the effect that any changes may have on the insurance industry 
without federal movement on superfund reform  the enforcement of superfund liability has occasionally shifted to the states 
states are being forced to reconsider state level cleanup statutes and regulations 
as individual states move forward  the potential for conflicting state regulation becomes greater 
in a few states  we have seen cases brought against insureds or directly against insurance companies for environmental pollution and natural resources damages 
to date  only a few natural resource claims have been filed and they are being vigorously defended 
significant uncertainty remains as to the cost of remediating the state sites 
because of the large number of state sites  such sites could prove even more costly in the aggregate than superfund sites 
in establishing our toxic waste reserves  we evaluate the exposure presented by each insured 
as part of this evaluation  we consider a variety of factors including the probable liability  available insurance coverage  relevant judicial interpretations  past settlement values of similar claims as well as facts that are unique to each insured 
uncertainty remains as to our ultimate liability relating to toxic waste claims 
however  toxic waste losses appear to be developing as expected due to relatively stable claim trends 
in many cases  claims are being settled for less than initially anticipated due to more efficient site remediation efforts 
in other cases  we have been successful at buying back our policies  thus removing the threat of additional losses in the future 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance recoverable  related to toxic waste claims 
there are virtually no reinsurance recoveries related to these claims 
years ended december in millions reserves  beginning of year incurred losses losses paid reserves  end of year of the net toxic waste loss reserves at december   million was for ibnr losses 
reinsurance recoverable 
reinsurance recoverable is the estimated amount recoverable from reinsurers related to the losses we have incurred 
at december   reinsurance recoverable included million recoverable with respect to paid losses and loss expenses  which is included in other assets  and billion recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses 
reinsurance recoverable on unpaid losses and loss expenses represents an estimate of the portion of our gross loss reserves that will be recovered from reinsurers 
such reinsurance recoverable is estimated as part of our loss reserving process using assumptions that are consistent with the assumptions used in estimating the gross loss reserves 
consequently  the estimation of reinsurance recoverable is subject to similar judgments and uncertainties as the estimation of gross loss reserves 
ceded reinsurance contracts do not relieve our primary obligation to our policyholders 
consequently  an exposure exists with respect to reinsurance recoverable to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet its obligations or disputes the liabilities assumed under the reinsurance contracts 
we are selective in regard to our reinsurers  placing reinsurance with only those reinsurers with strong balance sheets and superior underwriting ability  and we monitor the financial strength of our reinsurers on an ongoing basis 
nevertheless  in recent years  certain of our reinsurers have experienced financial difficulties or exited the reinsurance business 
in addition  we may become involved in coverage disputes with our reinsurers 
a provision for estimated uncollectible reinsurance is recorded based on periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers  the financial condition of the reinsurers  coverage disputes and other relevant factors 
prior year loss development because loss reserve estimates are subject to the outcome of future events  changes in estimates are unavoidable given that loss trends vary and time is required for changes in trends to be recognized and confirmed 
reserve changes that increase previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as unfavorable or adverse development or reserve strengthening 
reserve changes that decrease previous estimates of ultimate cost are referred to as favorable development or reserve releases 
a reconciliation of our beginning and ending loss reserves  net of reinsurance  for the three years ended december  is as follows in millions net loss reserves  beginning of year net incurred losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years net payments for losses and loss expenses related to current year prior years net loss reserves  end of year during  we experienced overall favorable prior year development of million  which represented of the net loss reserves as of december  this compares with unfavorable prior year development of million during  which represented of the net loss reserves at december   and million during  which represented of the net loss reserves at december  such development was reflected in operating results in these respective years 
the net favorable development of million in was due to various factors 
the most significant factors were we experienced favorable development of about million in the short tail homeowners and commercial property classes  primarily related to the accident year 
this favorable development arose from the lower than expected emergence of losses during relative to expectations used to establish our loss reserves at the end of the severity of late reported property claims that emerged during was lower than expected and case development  including salvage recoveries  on previously reported claims was better than expected 
because the incidence of property losses is subject to a considerable element of fortuity  reserve estimates for these classes are based on an analysis of past loss experience on average over a period of years 
as a result  the favorable development in was recognized but had a relatively modest effect on our determination of carried property loss reserves at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the fidelity classes due to lower than expected reported loss emergence  mainly related to more recent accident years 
loss reserve estimates in these classes include an expectation of more large late reported losses than actually occurred in however  since we would still expect such losses to occur in a typical year  the favorable development in was given only modest weight in our determination of carried fidelity loss reserves at december  we experienced favorable development of about million in the run off of our reinsurance assumed business due primarily to better than expected reported loss activity from cedants 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity 
favorable development in the and accident years more than offset continued unfavorable development in accident years through reported loss activity related to accident years and was less than expected due to a favorable business climate  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions 
while these accident years are somewhat immature  we concluded that there was sufficient evidence to modestly decrease the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
on the other hand  we continued to experience significant reported loss activity related to the through accident years  largely from claims related to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities 
as a result  we increased the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
the fact that our initial estimates for accident years and subsequent are developing favorably was recognized as one among several factors in the determination of loss reserves for the accident year for these classes 
other factors included the specific aspects of the current claim environment and the recent downward trend in prices 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the personal automobile class 
case development during on previously reported claims was better than expected  reflecting improved case management 
also  the number of late reported claims was less than expected  reflecting a continuation of recent generally favorable frequency trends 
both of these factors were reflected in the determination of the carried loss reserves for this class at december  we experienced adverse development of about million in the commercial liability classes  including million related to asbestos and toxic waste claims 
the adverse development was primarily due to reported loss activity in accident years prior to that was worse than expected 
modestly adverse development in the through accident years was offset by favorable development in the more recent accident years 
the loss activity in accident years prior to primarily related to specific individual excess liability and other liability claims  which are inherently volatile 
therefore  this adverse development had little overall effect on our determination of carried loss reserves for these classes at december  the net unfavorable development of million in was due to various factors 
the most significant were we experienced adverse development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity 
the adverse development resulted from continued significant reported loss activity related to accident years through  largely from claims related to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities 
as a result  we increased the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
conversely  reported loss activity related to accident years and was less than expected due to a favorable business climate  lower policy limits and better terms and conditions 
while these accident years are somewhat immature  we concluded that there was sufficient evidence to modestly decrease the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
we experienced adverse development of about million related to accident years prior to  including million related to asbestos claims 
the adverse development was due largely to our strengthening loss reserves for commercial liability classes  primarily commercial excess liability 
there was significant reported loss activity during related to these older accident years  which caused us to extend the expected loss emergence period 
we experienced favorable development of about million in the short tail homeowners and commercial property classes  primarily related to the accident year 
the favorable development arose from the lower than expected emergence of late reported losses during relative to expectations used to establish our loss reserves at the end of we experienced favorable development of about million in the fidelity classes due to lower than expected reported loss emergence  mainly related to more recent accident years 
the net unfavorable development of million in was also the result of various factors 
the most significant factors were we experienced adverse development of about million in the professional liability classes other than fidelity 
the adverse development resulted from significant reported loss activity in accident years through due in large part to claims related to corporate failures and allegations of management misconduct and accounting irregularities  especially those involving investment banks and other financial institutions 
as a result  we increased the expected loss ratios for these accident years 
we experienced adverse development of about million related to accident years prior to  including million related to asbestos claims 
we strengthened loss reserves for certain commercial liability classes due to significant reported loss activity during related to these older accident years 
we experienced adverse development of about million in the workers compensation class due primarily to higher average severity of the medical portion of these claims 
we experienced favorable development of about million related to the accident year  due in large part to an unusually low amount of late reported homeowners and commercial property losses 
we experienced favorable development of million due to a reduction of loss reserves related to the september attack 
in item of this report  we present an analysis of our consolidated loss reserve development on a calendar year basis for each of the ten years prior to the variability in reserve development over the ten year period illustrates the uncertainty of the loss reserving process 
our us property and casualty subsidiaries are required to file annual statements with insurance regulatory authorities prepared on an accounting basis prescribed or permitted by such authorities 
these annual statements include an analysis of loss reserves  referred to as schedule p  that presents accident year loss development information by line of business for the nine years prior to it is our intention to post the schedule p for our combined us property and casualty subsidiaries on our website as soon as it becomes available 
investment results property and casualty investment income before taxes increased by in both and compared with the respective prior years 
growth in both years was due to an increase in invested assets  which reflected substantial cash flow from operations over the period 
the after tax annualized yield on the investment portfolio that supports our property and casualty insurance business was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate on our investment income was in compared with in and in the effective tax rate fluctuates as the result of our holding a different proportion of our investment portfolio in tax exempt securities during each year 
on an after tax basis  property and casualty investment income increased by in and in management uses property and casualty investment income after tax  a non gaap financial measure  to evaluate its investment performance because it reflects the impact of any change in the proportion of the investment portfolio invested in tax exempt securities and is therefore more meaningful for analysis purposes than investment income before income tax 
other income and charges other income and charges  which include miscellaneous income and expenses of the property and casualty subsidiaries  were not significant in the last three years 
corporate and other corporate and other includes investment income earned on corporate invested assets  interest expense and other expenses not allocated to the operating subsidiaries  and the results of our real estate and other non insurance subsidiaries 
the results of chubb financial solutions cfs  which were previously reported separately  are now included in corporate and other 
cfs  which provided customized financial products to corporate clients  has been in run off since april corporate and other also included income from our investment in a corporate joint venture  allied world assurance company  ltd 
we acquired an interest in allied world in and used the equity method of accounting for this investment 
income from this investment did not have a material effect on the corporation s results of operations in any year but did fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
in july  allied world sold previously unissued shares of common stock through an initial public offering 
as a result of the public offering  we no longer consider allied world to be a corporate joint venture 
accordingly  the equity method of accounting is no longer used for this investment 
instead  our investment in allied world is now classified as an equity security 
as such  it is carried at market value as of the balance sheet date with unrealized appreciation or depreciation credited or charged to comprehensive income 
consequently  income from our investment in allied world will now only include any dividends we receive and gains or losses from any sale of our investment 
corporate and other produced a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million and million in and  respectively 
the lower loss in compared with was primarily due to a significantly smaller loss in our real estate operations and higher investment income 
corporate and other results were similar in and as an increase in investment income in was substantially offset by a larger loss in our real estate operations 
the growth in investment income in and was due to an increase in corporate invested assets over the period  resulting from the issuance of chubb s common stock upon the settlement of equity unit warrants and purchase contracts and under stock based employee compensation plans 
real estate real estate operations resulted in a loss before taxes of million in compared with losses of million in and million in the improvement in real estate results in was due to a significant decrease in impairment losses compared with during  we committed to a plan to sell a parcel of land in new jersey that we had previously intended to hold and develop 
the decision to sell the property was based on our assessment of the real estate market and our concern about zoning issues 
as a result of our decision to sell this property  we reassessed the recoverability of its carrying value 
based on our reassessment  we recognized an impairment loss of million during the year to reduce the carrying value of the property to its estimated fair value 
the loss in was due primarily to the recognition of impairment losses on two commercial properties 
real estate revenues were million in  million in and million in the higher revenues in were due to the sale of one commercial property for approximately million 
at december   we owned approximately million of land and million of commercial properties and land parcels under lease 
management believes that it has made adequate provisions for impairment of real estate assets 
chubb financial solutions cfs s business was primarily structured credit derivatives  principally as a counterparty in portfolio credit default swap contracts 
chubb guaranteed all of these obligations 
in april  the corporation announced its intention to exit cfs s business 
since that date  cfs has negotiated the early termination of most of its contractual obligations within its financial products portfolio 
the few remaining contracts will likely be run off over their remaining lives 
in a typical portfolio credit default swap  cfs participated in the senior layer of a structure designed to replicate the performance of a portfolio of corporate or asset backed securities 
the structure of these portfolio credit default swaps generally would require cfs to make payment to counterparties to the extent cumulative losses  related to credit events of the referenced entities within a portfolio  exceed a specified threshold 
portfolio credit default swaps are derivatives and are carried in the financial statements at estimated fair value  which represents management s best estimate of the cost to exit our positions 
credit default swaps tend to be unique transactions and there is no market for trading such exposures 
to estimate the fair value of the obligation in each credit default swap  we use internal valuation models that are similar to external valuation models 
changes in fair value are included in income in the period of the change 
cfs produced near breakeven results in compared with a loss before taxes of million in and million in the loss in related to the termination of a principal and interest guarantee contract 
the loss in related to the termination of cfs s obligations under several portfolio credit default swaps 
cfs s aggregate exposure  or retained risk  from each of its remaining in force portfolio credit default swaps is referred to as notional amount 
notional amounts are used to express the extent of involvement in swap transactions 
these amounts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual cash flows and are not necessarily representative of the potential for gain or loss 
the notional amounts are not recorded on the balance sheet 
since we decided to exit this business  cfs has terminated certain portfolio credit default swaps with the original counterparties at negotiated settlement amounts 
cfs has also entered into credit default swaps with third parties that effectively offset existing credit default swaps 
as of december   the notional amount of such offsetting credit default swaps was approximately billion 
the notional amount of cfs s remaining credit default swaps was billion at december  our realistic loss exposure is a very small portion of the billion notional amount as our position is senior to subordinated interests of about million in the aggregate 
in addition  using our internal ratings models  we estimate that the credit ratings of the remaining individual portfolio credit default swaps at december  were aaa 
in addition to portfolio credit default swaps  cfs entered into a derivative contract linked to an equity market index that terminates in and a few other insignificant transactions 
the notional amount and fair value of our future obligations under derivative contracts were as follows december notional amount fair value in billions in millions credit default swaps other realized investment gains and losses net investment gains realized were as follows years ended december in millions net realized gains losses equity securities fixed maturities other invested assets transfer of reinsurance assumed business personal lines insurance brokerage chubb institute other than temporary impairment losses equity securities fixed maturities realized investment gains before tax realized investment gains after tax the net realized gains on other invested assets represent our share of changes in the estimated fair value of limited partnerships in which we have an interest 
in  we transferred our ongoing reinsurance business and certain related assets to harbor point limited 
in exchange  we received from harbor point million of convertible notes and warrants to purchase common stock of harbor point 
the notes and warrants represent in the aggregate on a fully diluted basis approximately of the new company 
the transaction resulted in a pre tax gain of million  of which million was recognized as a realized investment gain in the remaining gain of million was deferred and will be recognized based on the timing of the ultimate disposition of our economic interest in harbor point 
in  we completed the sale of personal lines insurance brokerage  inc based on the terms of the sale  we recognized a gain of million 
in  we sold the chubb institute 
under the terms of the sale  we recognized a loss of million 
decisions to sell equity securities and fixed maturities are governed principally by considerations of investment opportunities and tax consequences 
as a result  realized gains and losses on the sale of these investments may vary significantly from period to period 
however  such gains and losses generally have little  if any  impact on shareholders equity as almost all of these investments are carried at fair value  with the unrealized appreciation or depreciation reflected in comprehensive income 
a primary reason for the sale of fixed maturities in each of the last three years has been to improve our after tax portfolio return without sacrificing quality where market opportunities have existed to do so 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of  to reduce our income tax liability  we engaged in a program to sell taxable and tax exempt fixed maturities to generate realized losses to offset a portion of the gain related to the harbor point transaction 
we regularly review those invested assets whose fair value is less than cost to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
in evaluating whether a decline in value of any investment is temporary or other than temporary  we consider various quantitative criteria and qualitative factors including the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than the cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow us to recover our cost  general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
if a decline in the fair value of an individual security is deemed to be other than temporary  the difference between cost and estimated fair value is charged to income as a realized investment loss 
the fair value of the investment becomes its new cost basis 
information related to investment securities in an unrealized loss position at december  and is included in note b of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
income taxes as a result of progress toward the settlement of certain tax matters  we recognized a million tax benefit in the third quarter of in connection with the sale of a subsidiary a number of years ago  we agreed to indemnify the buyer for certain pre closing tax liabilities 
during the first quarter of  we settled this obligation with the purchaser 
accordingly  we reduced our income tax liability  which resulted in the recognition of a benefit of million 
capital resources and liquidity capital resources and liquidity represent a company s overall financial strength and its ability to generate cash flows  borrow funds at competitive rates and raise new capital to meet operating and growth needs 
capital resources capital resources provide protection for policyholders  furnish the financial strength to support the business of underwriting insurance risks and facilitate continued business growth 
at december   the corporation had shareholders equity of billion and total debt of billion 
the board of directors approved a two for one stock split in the form of a stock dividend payable to shareholders of record on march  share and per share amounts have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
in  chubb issued million of unsecured senior notes due in and million purchase contracts to purchase its common stock 
the notes and purchase contracts were issued together in the form of equity units  each of which initially represented principal amount of notes and one purchase contract 
in may  the notes were successfully remarketed as required by their terms 
the interest rate on the notes was reset to from  effective may  the remarketed notes mature on august  each purchase contract obligated the holder to purchase  on or before august   for a settlement price of  a variable number of shares of chubb s common stock 
the number of shares purchased was determined based on a formula that considered the market price of chubb s common stock immediately prior to the time of settlement in relation to the per share sale price of the common stock at the time the equity units were offered 
upon settlement of the purchase contracts  chubb issued  shares of common stock and received proceeds of million 
in  chubb issued million of unsecured senior notes due in and million mandatorily exercisable warrants to purchase its common stock 
the notes and warrants were issued together in the form of equity units  each of which initially represented principal amount of notes and one warrant 
in august  the notes were successfully remarketed as required by their terms 
the interest rate on the notes was reset to  effective august  the remarketed notes mature on november  each warrant obligated the holder to purchase  on or before november   for a settlement price of  a variable number of shares of chubb s common stock 
the number of shares purchased was determined based on a formula that considered the market price of chubb s common stock immediately prior to the time of settlement in relation to the per share sale price of the common stock at the time the equity units were offered 
upon settlement of the warrants  chubb issued  shares of common stock and received proceeds of million 
chubb also has outstanding million of unsecured notes due in  million of unsecured notes due in  million of unsecured notes due in  million of unsecured debentures due in and million of unsecured debentures due in chubb executive risk inc  a wholly owned subsidiary  has outstanding million of unsecured notes due in  which are guaranteed by chubb 
at december   executive risk capital trust  wholly owned by chubb executive risk  had outstanding million of capital securities 
the sole assets of the trust were debentures issued by chubb executive risk 
the capital securities were subject to mandatory redemption in upon repayment of the debentures 
the capital securities were also subject to mandatory redemption in certain other specified circumstances beginning in on february   the debentures were repaid and the trust redeemed the capital securities at a price that included a make whole premium of million in the aggregate 
management regularly monitors the corporation s capital resources 
in connection with our long term capital strategy  chubb from time to time contributes capital to its property and casualty subsidiaries 
in addition  in order to satisfy capital needs as a result of any rating agency capital adequacy or other future rating issues  or in the event we were to need additional capital to make strategic investments in light of market opportunities  we may take a variety of actions  which could include the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
we believe that our strong financial position and conservative debt level provide us with the flexibility and capacity to obtain funds externally through debt or equity financings on both a short term and long term basis 
in june  a shelf registration statement that chubb filed in march was declared effective by the securities and exchange commission 
under the registration statement  up to billion of various types of securities could be issued 
at december   approximately million remained under the shelf registration statement 
in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of chubb s common stock 
in december  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional  shares of common stock 
in  we repurchased  shares of chubb s common stock in open market transactions at a cost of million 
in january  we repurchased  shares under an accelerated stock buyback program at an initial price of per share  for a total cost of million 
the program was completed in march  at which time  under the terms of the agreement  we received a price adjustment based on the volume weighted average price of chubb s common stock during the program period 
the price adjustment could be settled  at our election  in chubb s common stock or cash 
we elected to have the counterparty deliver  additional shares in settlement of the price adjustment 
during the remainder of  we repurchased  shares in the open market 
in the aggregate  in  we repurchased  shares of chubb s common stock at a cost of  million 
as of december    shares remained under the share repurchase authorization  which has no expiration date 
based on our outlook for  we expect to repurchase all of the shares remaining under the authorization by the end of ratings chubb and its insurance subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies 
these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of our financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet our obligations to policyholders 
credit ratings assess a company s ability to make timely payments of interest and principal on its debt 
the following table summarizes the corporation s credit ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of february  standard am best poor s moody s fitch senior unsecured debt rating aa a a a commercial paper amb a p f financial strength ratings assess an insurer s ability to meet its financial obligations to policyholders 
the following table summarizes our property and casualty subsidiaries financial strength ratings from the major independent rating organizations as of february  standard am best poor s moody s fitch financial strength a aa aa aa ratings are an important factor in establishing our competitive position in the insurance markets 
there can be no assurance that our ratings will continue for any given period of time or that they will not be changed 
it is possible that positive or negative rating actions by one or more of the rating agencies may occur in the future 
if our ratings were downgraded  we may incur higher borrowing costs and may have more limited means to access capital 
in addition  a downgrade in our financial strength ratings could adversely affect the competitive position of our insurance operations  including a possible reduction in demand for our products in certain markets 
liquidity liquidity is a measure of a company s ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short and long term cash requirements of its business operations 
the corporation s liquidity requirements in the past have been met by funds from operations as well as the issuance of commercial paper and debt and equity securities 
we expect that our liquidity requirements in the future will be met by these sources of funds or borrowings from our credit facility 
our property and casualty operations provide liquidity in that premiums are generally received months or even years before losses are paid under the policies purchased by such premiums 
historically  cash receipts from operations  consisting of insurance premiums and investment income  have provided more than sufficient funds to pay losses  operating expenses and dividends to chubb 
after satisfying our cash requirements  excess cash flows are used to build the investment portfolio and thereby increase future investment income 
our strong underwriting results continued to generate substantial new cash in new cash from operations available for investment by the property and casualty subsidiaries was approximately billion in compared with billion in and billion in new cash available was lower in than in due primarily to substantially higher income tax payments and lower premium receipts 
new cash available in was lower than in due to a significant increase in paid losses in whereas premium receipts were only modestly higher compared with the increase in paid losses in was due primarily to directors and officers liability payments related to accident years and prior  payments related to hurricane katrina and payments related to two surety claims 
our property and casualty subsidiaries maintain investments in highly liquid  short term and other marketable securities 
accordingly  we do not anticipate selling long term fixed maturity investments to meet any liquidity needs 
chubb s liquidity requirements primarily include the payment of dividends to shareholders and interest and principal on debt obligations 
the declaration and payment of future dividends to chubb s shareholders will be at the discretion of chubb s board of directors and will depend upon many factors  including our operating results  financial condition  capital requirements and any regulatory constraints 
as a holding company  chubb s ability to continue to pay dividends to shareholders and to satisfy its debt obligations relies on the availability of liquid assets  which is dependent in large part on the dividend paying ability of its property and casualty subsidiaries 
our property and casualty subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate that restrict the amount of dividends they may pay without the prior approval of regulatory authorities 
the restrictions are generally based on net income and on certain levels of policyholders surplus as determined in accordance with statutory accounting practices 
dividends in excess of such thresholds are considered extraordinary and require prior regulatory approval 
during  these subsidiaries paid to chubb dividends totaling million 
the maximum dividend distribution that may be made by the property and casualty subsidiaries to chubb during without prior approval is approximately billion 
chubb has a revolving credit agreement with a group of banks that provides for unsecured borrowings of up to million 
the revolving credit facility terminates on june  on the termination date of the agreement  any loans then outstanding become payable 
there have been no borrowings under this agreement 
various interest rate options are available to chubb  all of which are based on market interest rates 
the agreement contains customary restrictive covenants including a covenant to maintain a minimum consolidated shareholders equity  as adjusted 
at december   chubb was in compliance with all such covenants 
the facility is available for general corporate purposes and to support our commercial paper borrowing arrangement 
contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements the following table provides our future payments due by period under contractual obligations as of december   aggregated by type of obligation 
and and there after total in millions principal due under long term debt a  interest payments on long term debt a future minimum rental payments under operating leases total a on february   million of capital securities due february were redeemed 
the above table excludes certain commitments totaling billion at december  to fund limited partnership investments 
these capital commitments can be called by the partnerships during the commitment period on average  to years to fund working capital needs or the purchase of new investments 
the above table also excludes estimated future cash flows related to our carried loss reserves at december  there is typically no stated contractual commitment associated with property and casualty insurance loss reserves 
the obligation to pay a claim arises only when a covered loss event occurs and a settlement is reached 
the vast majority of our loss reserves relate to claims for which settlements have not yet been reached 
our loss reserves therefore represent estimates of future payments 
these estimates are dependent on the outcome of claim settlements that will occur over many years 
accordingly  the payment of the loss reserves is not fixed as to either amount or timing 
our gross liability for unpaid losses and loss expenses was billion at december  of this billion liability  we estimate that approximately billion will be paid in  an aggregate billion will be paid in and  and an aggregate billion will be paid in and the estimate is based on our historical loss payment patterns 
the ultimate amount and timing of loss payments will likely differ from our estimate and the differences could be material 
we expect that these loss payments will be funded  in large part  by future cash receipts from operations 
the corporation does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the corporation s financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources  other than as disclosed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
invested assets the main objectives in managing our investment portfolios are to maximize after tax investment income and total investment returns while minimizing credit risks in order to provide maximum support to the insurance underwriting operations 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including underwriting results and our resulting tax position  regulatory requirements  fluctuations in interest rates and consideration of other market risks 
investment decisions are centrally managed by investment professionals based on guidelines established by management and approved by the boards of directors of chubb and the respective operating companies 
our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of high quality bonds  principally tax exempt  us treasury and government agency  mortgage backed securities and corporate issues as well as foreign government and corporate bonds that support our international operations 
in addition  the portfolio includes equity securities  primarily publicly traded common stocks  and other invested assets  primarily private equity limited partnerships  all of which are held with the objective of capital appreciation 
in our us operations  during  and  we invested new cash in tax exempt bonds and  to a lesser extent  equity securities 
in and  we also invested new cash in taxable bonds  whereas in we decreased our holdings of taxable bonds  principally us treasury securities 
in  the taxable bonds we invested in were primarily mortgage backed securities and  to a lesser extent  corporate bonds 
in  the taxable bonds were primarily us treasury securities and mortgage backed securities and  to a lesser extent  corporate bonds 
our objective is to achieve the appropriate mix of taxable and tax exempt securities in our portfolio to balance both investment and tax strategies 
at december   of our us fixed maturity portfolio was invested in tax exempt bonds compared with at december  and at december  fixed maturity securities that we have the ability and intent to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity 
all our other fixed maturities  which may be sold prior to maturity to support our investment strategies  such as in response to changes in interest rates and the yield curve or to maximize after tax returns  are classified as available for sale 
fixed maturities classified as held to maturity are carried at amortized cost while fixed maturities classified as available for sale are carried at market value 
about of the fixed maturity portfolio was classified as held to maturity at december   and changes in the general interest rate environment affect the returns available on new fixed maturity investments 
while a rising interest rate environment enhances the returns available on new investments  it reduces the market value of existing fixed maturity investments and thus the availability of gains on disposition 
a decline in interest rates reduces the returns available on new investments but increases the market value of existing investments  creating the opportunity for realized investment gains on disposition 
the unrealized appreciation before tax of investments carried at market value  which includes fixed maturities classified as available for sale and equity securities  was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation is reflected in comprehensive income  net of applicable deferred income tax 
the unrealized market appreciation before tax of those fixed maturities carried at amortized cost was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
such unrealized appreciation was not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
changes in unrealized market appreciation or depreciation of fixed maturities were due primarily to fluctuations in interest rates 
change in accounting principles effective december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r 
sfas no 
requires an employer to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and to recognize changes in the funded status in comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur 
retrospective application is not permitted 
the adoption of sfas no 
reduced shareholders equity at december  by million 
adoption of the statement did not have any effect on the corporation s net income in and will not in future years 
the adoption of the sfas no 
is discussed further in note c of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our primary exposure to market risks relates to our investment portfolio  which is sensitive to changes in interest rates and  to a lesser extent  credit quality  prepayment  foreign currency exchange rates and equity prices 
we also have exposure to market risks through our debt obligations 
analytical tools and monitoring systems are in place to assess each of these elements of market risk 
investment portfolio interest rate risk is the price sensitivity of a security that promises a fixed return to changes in interest rates 
changes in market interest rates directly affect the market value of our fixed income securities 
we view the potential changes in price of our fixed income investments within the overall context of asset and liability management 
our actuaries estimate the payout pattern of our liabilities  primarily our property and casualty loss reserves  to determine their duration  which is the present value of the weighted average payments expressed in years 
we set duration targets for our fixed income investment portfolios after consideration of the duration of these liabilities and other factors  which we believe mitigates the overall effect of interest rate risk for the corporation 
the following table provides information about our fixed maturity investments  which are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates at december  and the cash flows are based on the earlier of the call date or the maturity date or  for mortgage backed securities  expected payment patterns 
actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions tax exempt average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities average interest rate mortgage backed securities average interest rate total at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions tax exempt average interest rate taxable other than mortgage backed securities average interest rate mortgage backed securities average interest rate total credit risk is the potential loss resulting from adverse changes in the issuer s ability to repay the debt obligation 
we have consistently invested in high quality marketable securities 
as a result  we believe that we have minimal credit quality risk 
about of the taxable bonds in our portfolio are issued by the us treasury or us government agencies or rated aa or better by moody s or standard and poor s 
of the tax exempt bonds  about are rated aa or better with about rated aaa 
about of our bond portfolio is below investment grade 
our taxable bonds have an average maturity of five years  while our tax exempt bonds mature on average in nine years 
prepayment risk refers to the changes in prepayment patterns related to decreases and increases in interest rates that can either shorten or lengthen the expected timing of the principal repayments and thus the average life of a security  potentially reducing or increasing its effective yield 
such risk exists primarily within our portfolio of mortgage backed securities 
we monitor such risk regularly 
mortgage backed securities comprised and of our taxable bond portfolio at year end and  respectively 
about of our mortgage backed securities holdings at december  related to residential mortgages consisting of government agency pass through securities  government agency collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and aaa rated non agency cmos backed by government agency collateral or single family home mortgages 
the majority of the cmos are actively traded in liquid markets and market value information is readily available from broker dealers 
an additional of our mortgage backed securities were call protected  aaa rated commercial mortgage backed securities 
the remaining mortgage backed holdings were all investment grade  predominantly commercial mortgage backed securities 
foreign currency risk is the sensitivity to foreign exchange rate fluctuations of the market value and investment income related to foreign currency denominated financial instruments 
the functional currency of our foreign operations is generally the currency of the local operating environment since business is primarily transacted in such local currency 
we reduce the risks relating to currency fluctuations by generally maintaining investments in those foreign currencies in which our property and casualty subsidiaries have loss reserves and other liabilities 
such investments generally have characteristics similar to our liabilities in those currencies 
at december   the property and casualty subsidiaries held non us investments of billion supporting their international operations 
these investments have quality and maturity characteristics similar to our domestic portfolio 
the principal currencies creating foreign exchange rate risk for the property and casualty subsidiaries are the canadian dollar  the british pound sterling and the euro 
the following table provides information about those fixed maturity investments that are denominated in these currencies 
the table presents cash flows of principal amounts in us dollar equivalents by expected maturity dates at december  actual cash flows could differ from the expected amounts 
at december  total estimated there amortized market after cost value in millions canadian dollar british pound sterling euro equity price risk is the potential loss in market value of our equity securities resulting from adverse changes in stock prices 
in general  equities have more year to year price variability than intermediate term high grade bonds 
however  returns over longer time frames have been consistently higher 
our publicly traded equity securities are high quality  diversified across industries and readily marketable 
a hypothetical decrease of in the market price of each of the equity securities held at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in the fair value of the equity securities portfolio 
our other invested assets comprise investments in private equity limited partnerships 
limited partnership investments by their nature are less liquid and involve more risk than other investments 
we actively manage our market risk through type of asset class and domestic and international diversification 
we review the performance of these investments on a quarterly basis and we obtain audited financial statements 
a hypothetical decrease of in the fair value of each of our limited partnership investments at december  and would have resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively 
all of the above risks are monitored on an ongoing basis 
a combination of in house systems and proprietary models and externally licensed software are used to analyze individual securities as well as each portfolio
