item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected financial data  risk factors  forward looking statements and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes and other data  all of which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain prior year information has been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
overview we are one of the largest providers of healthcare staffing services in the united states 
our healthcare staffing business segment represented approximately of our revenue and is comprised of travel and per diem nurse staffing  travel allied health staffing  as well as clinical research staffing 
travel nurse staffing  our core business  represented approximately of our total revenue and of our healthcare staffing business segment revenue 
other healthcare staffing services include the placement of per diem nurse  allied healthcare professionals  such as radiology technicians  rehabilitation therapists and respiratory therapists  and the placement of clinical research professionals 
our other human capital management services business segment represented approximately of our revenue and consists of education and training and retained search services 
for the year ended december   our revenue was million  and net income was million  or per diluted share 
during  we generated million in cash flow from operations and we ended the year with total debt of million  resulting in a debt to total capitalization ratio of as of december  in general  we evaluate the company s financial condition and operating results by monitoring several key volume and profitability indicators such as number of orders  contract bookings  number of ftes  price  and contribution income see segment information 
we also use measurement of our cash flow generation and operating and leverage ratios to help us assess our financial condition 
our healthcare staffing revenue and earnings are impacted by the relative supply of and demand for nurses at healthcare facilities 
we rely significantly on our ability to recruit and retain nurses and other healthcare professionals who possess the skills  experience and  as required  licensure necessary to meet the specified requirements of our clients 
shortages of qualified nurses and other healthcare professionals could limit our ability to fill open orders and grow our revenue and net income 
in general  we believe nurses are more willing to seek travel assignments during relatively high levels of demand for contract employment  and conversely  are more reluctant to seek travel assignments during and immediately following periods of weak demand for contract employment 
we also believe demand for travel nurse staffing services will be favorably impacted in the long term by an aging population and an increasing shortage of nurses 
cross country staffing is our core staffing brand that markets its staffing services to hospitals and healthcare facilities throughout the us as well as operates differentiated recruiting brands to recruit registered nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
as a part of its business strategy  cross country staffing is pursuing and implementing exclusive and preferred provider relationships with hospital clients and group purchasing organizations 
cross country staffing provides clients with a suite of solutions to facilitate the efficient management of their temporary workforce while decreasing overall operating costs 
these range from efficiency enhancing technology to full vendor management solutions 
we operate differentiated nurse recruiting brands consisting of cross country travcorps  medstaff  novapro  cross country local and assignment america to recruit nurses and allied healthcare professionals on a domestic and international basis 
we believe that these professionals are attracted to us because we offer a wide range of diverse assignments at attractive locations  competitive compensation and benefit packages  as well as high levels of customer service 
currently  the market for our healthcare staffing services reflects relatively strong demand  as measured by the average monthly number of open orders from our hospital clients 
demand is substantially higher than the low point of the most recent industry down turn in  but is well below the prior industry peak in we believe this is due to improved labor dynamics that have created increased nurse turnover at hospitals in  which in turn has contributed to price increases for our nurse staffing services and an improvement in the supply of rns seeking travel assignments with us 
despite this more favorable environment for our core nurse staffing business  hospital in patient admissions trends remained soft in with low near term expectations for growth 
typically  as admissions increase  temporary employees are often added before full time employees are hired 
as admissions decline  clients tend to reduce their use of temporary employees before u ndertaking layoffs of their regular employees 
we believe many of the characteristics of a transition from a demand constrained environment toward a more favorable supply constrained environment were present during  particularly the improvement in pricing 
history in july  an affiliate of charterhouse group  inc charterhouse and certain members of management acquired the assets of cross country staffing  our predecessor  from w

each of our field employees on travel assignment works for us under a contract 
these contracts typically last weeks 
payroll contract employees are hourly employees whose contract specifies the hourly rate they will be paid  and any other benefits they are entitled to receive during the contract period 
for payroll contract employees  we bill clients at an hourly rate and assume all employer costs  including payroll  withholding taxes  benefits  professional liability insurance and occupational safety and health administration  or osha  requirements  as well as any travel and housing arrangements 
approximately of our field personnel are directly employed by us 
mobile contract employees are hourly employees of the hospital client and receive an agreement that specifies the hourly rates they will be paid by the hospital employer  as well as any benefits they are entitled to receive from us 
we recruit mobile contract employees for our hospital clients and provide those employees with company leased apartments and travel related support 
we are compensated for the services we provide at a predetermined rate negotiated with our hospital clients

discontinued operations discontinued operations during the years ended december    and include results from operations of the healthcare consulting business previously classified in our other human capital management services business segment 
on october   cross country healthcare sold assets of its jennings ryan kolb jrk and gill balsano consulting gbc practices to mitretek systems  inc mitretek for million in cash plus a working capital adjustment 
the carrying amount of net assets sold was million and consisted primarily of goodwill and other intangibles with a carrying amount of million

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  and fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on this assessment  we determined that the carrying amount of the net assets as then reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet exceeded its estimated fair value 
in accordance with the assessment  the company recorded a pretax charge of million to discontinued operations 
the charge represented the impairment of goodwill in the amount of million and a reduction in value of other tangible assets in the amount of million 
during the third quarter of  we abandoned our efforts to sell the remaining consulting practice and shut down the residual operations 
we continue to account for the consulting practice as discontinued operations within the consolidated statements of income and cash flows and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we estimated the remaining costs associated with the shut down of the business and recorded these costs in loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter of these costs were allocated to the impairment valuation previously recorded in the fourth quarter of in accordance with fasb statement no 
 any adjustments to these estimated amounts have been recorded to discontinued operations in subsequent periods

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue from services increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  revenue from both of our business segments contributed to this increase 
the increase in our healthcare staffing business was mostly due to our acquisition of metropolitan research in the third quarter 
also contributing to the increase was higher organic revenue from our travel nurse staffing operations that was partially offset by a decrease in our per diem  clinical research  and travel allied health staffing operations 
the increase in other human capital management business was primarily due to an increase in our retained search business partially offset by a decrease in our education and training business 
revenue from our healthcare staffing business segment increased million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million for the year ended december   primarily due to the acquisition of metropolitan research 
excluding metropolitan research  healthcare staffing revenue declined slightly due to lower revenue from our per diem  organic clinical research  and travel allied health operations partially offset by increases in revenue in our travel nurse staffing operations 
the slight decrease is due to lower volume partially offset by an increase in pricing 
the average number of full time equivalents ftes on contract decreased from the prior year 
excluding metropolitan research  ftes decreased 
average healthcare staffing revenue per fte and average bill rates both increased approximately during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  mobile contracts  where the nurse is on the hospital payroll  accounted for approximately of our staffing volume in the years ended december  and for the year ended december   nurse staffing operations generated of healthcare staffing revenue and was generated by other operations 
for the year ended december   of healthcare staffing revenue was generated from nursing operations and was generated by other operations 
revenue from other human capital management services for the year ended december   increased to million from million in the year ended december  an increase in revenue from our retained search business more than offset lower revenue from our education and training business 
the lower revenue from our educational training business primarily reflects a lower number of seminars and lower average attendance per seminar  partially offset by an increase in pricing in the year ended december   compared to the year ending december  direct operating expenses are comprised primarily of field employee compensation expenses  housing expenses  travel expenses and field insurance expenses 
direct operating expenses totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  direct operating expenses represented of revenue for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  in the second quarter of  we increased our insurance reserves by approximately million  or of revenue  based on specific unfavorable developments in certain professional liability cases 
refer to legal proceedings for a more comprehensive discussion of this litigation 
excluding this charge in  direct operating expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased primarily due to a widening of our bill pay spread in our travel staffing operations  partially offset by higher housing and health insurance expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased compensation in our retained search business  an increase in unallocated corporate overhead  and additional expenses from metropolitan research 
unallocated corporate overhead was million in the year ended december   compared to million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher expenses to upgrade  protect  and maintain our key information systems  including incremental disaster recovery costs and higher legal fees 
as a percentage of consolidated revenue  unallocated corporate overhead was during the year ended december   and during the year ended december  as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expenses were and for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to the increase in corporate unallocated overhead  negative operating leverage in our per diem operations and higher selling expenses in our organic clinical research staffing business 
bad debt expense totaled million for the year ended december   which represented approximately of revenue compared to million for the year ended december  which represented approximately of revenue 
contribution income from our healthcare staffing segment for the year ended december   increased  or million  to million from million in the year ended december  as a percentage of healthcare staffing revenue  contribution income was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  in  our profitability was negatively impacted by the significantly higher insurance reserves recorded in the second quarter as discussed previously 
excluding this million charge  contribution margin as a percentage of revenue increased primarily due to a widening of our bill pay spread in our travel staffing operations partially offset by higher housing and health insurance costs 
contribution income from other human capital management services for the year ended december   increased to million from million in the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to higher revenue from our retained search business combined with improved operating leverage in both the retained search and education and training businesses

accordingly  we did not capitalize any of the associated fees and expense related to the offering 
refer to discussion in the notes to our consolidated financial statements note stockholders equity 
interest expense  net totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to lower average borrowings outstanding during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  partially offset by a slightly higher effective borrowing cost in the year ended december  the effective interest rate on our borrowings for the year ended december   was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  income tax expense totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the effective tax rate on continuing operations was for the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december   due to a more favorable mix of income among various tax jurisdictions

year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenue from services decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decline in revenue from our healthcare staffing businesses partially offset by an increase in our revenue from other human capital management businesses 
the decrease in our healthcare staffing business was mostly from our travel nurse staffing and per diem operations  but was partially offset by an increase in our allied health and clinical research staffing businesses 
revenue from our healthcare staffing business segment decreased million  or  from million in the year ended december   to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to a decrease in ftes  representing million of the decrease  partially offset by price and mix factors as described below 
the average number of ftes on contract decreased from the prior year 
this decline in volume was due to a decrease in ftes from our travel staffing operations partially offset by higher ftes in our clinical trials staffing and allied health staffing businesses 
our nurse staffing operations weakened throughout and due to a more cautious buying process on the part of acute care hospital customers which reduced the level of demand for our nurse staffing services along with a reduced level of interest of nursing professionals in pursuing temporary employment opportunities 
despite a more favorable demand and supply environment in our core nurse staffing business in  as discussed above  our staffing volume decreased year over year due  in part  to hospital in patient admissions trends that remained relatively flat during furthermore  we believe staffing volumes would have been higher absent the impact of hurricane wilma on the productivit y of our recruiters in october we estimated the impact of hurricane wilma on our fourth quarter s results was approximately million of revenue and per diluted share 
while the hurricane occurred in the fourth quarter of  we experienced the majority of its impact on our field fte count in the first quarter of average healthcare staffing revenue per fte and average bill rates increased during the year ended december   compared to the year ended december  mobile contracts  where the nurse is on the hospital payroll  accounted for approximately of our volume in our healthcare staffing business segment in year ended december   compared to of volume in the year ended december  for the year ended december   nurse staffing operations generated of healthcare staffing revenue and was generated by other operations

refer to legal proceedings for a more comprehensive discussion of this litigation 
excluding this charge to direct operating expenses  our direct operating expense as a percentage of revenue would have decreased primarily due to a widening of our bill pay spread in our travel nurse staffing business  a higher relative mix of business from our other human capital management services business segment which operates with relatively lower direct costs than our healthcare staffing business segment  and lower field health insurance expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses totaled million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to an increase in compensation expense  including investments in recruitment capacity  and an increase in unallocated corporate overhead

critical accounting principles and estimates we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  including those related to asset impairment  accruals for insurance  allowance for doubtful accounts  and contingencies and litigation 
we state our accounting policies in the notes to the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes for the year ended december   contained herein 
these estimates are based on information that is currently available to us and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could vary from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements we have recorded goodwill and intangibles resulting from our acquisitions through december  upon the adoption of fasb statement no 
on january   we ceased amortizing goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives and performed a transitional impairment analysis as of january   to assess the recoverability of these intangibles  in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
we also completed the annual impairment test of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets during the fourth quarters of  and based on the results of the tests  we determined that there was no impairment of goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets relating to continuing operations as of december    and the calculation of fair value used in these impairment assessments included a number of estimates and assumptions  including projections of future income and cash fl ows  the identification of appropriate market multiples and the choice of an appropriate discount rate 
if we are required to record an impairment charge in the future  it could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
we periodically evaluate the recovery of the carrying amount of net assets held for sale to determine if the net assets are impaired 
this evaluation can also be triggered by various indicators of impairment which could cause the estimated discounted cash flows to be less than the carrying amount of net assets 
in the fourth quarter of  we recognized an impairment charge on goodwill reported as discontinued operations of million relating to the remaining consulting practice classified as held for sale at that time 
during the year ended december   an additional impairment charge of million was also recorded in discontinued operations related to these net assets 
fair value was based on the latest offer received for the sale of the net assets of the remaining consulting practice 
during the third quarter of  we abandoned our efforts to sell the remaining consulting practice and shut down the remaining operations 
we estimated the remaining costs associated with the shut down of the business and recorded these costs in loss from discontinued operations in the third quarter of these costs were allocated to the impairment valuation previously recorded 
any adjustments to these estimated amounts have been recorded to discontinued operations in subsequent periods 
as of december   we had total goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization of million  net of accumulated amortization 
we maintain accruals for our health  workers compensation and professional liability policies that are partially self insured and are classified as accrued employee compensation and benefits on our consolidated balance sheets 
we determine the adequacy of these accruals by periodically evaluating our historical experience and trends related to health  workers compensation and professional liability claims and payments  based on an internally prepared actuarial model which is reviewed by an actuary and industry experience and trends 
if such information indicates that our accruals are overstated or understated  we will reduce or provide for additional accruals as appropriate 
healthcare insurance accruals have fluctuated with increases or decreases in the average number of temporary healthcare professionals on assignment and increases in national healthcare costs 
as of december  and  we had million and million a ccrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported health insurance claims

beginning in  the corporate employees were also covered through a partially self insured health plan 
at december   and  million and million  respectively  of the incurred but not reported health insurance claims accrual related to corporate employees 
workers compensation insurance accruals have generally increased over time due to the lag times associated with the settlement of claims as well as additional exposures arising from the current policy year 
as of december   we had million accrued for incurred but not reported workers compensation claims and retentions  net of related insurance recoveries receivable  an increase of million over the amount accrued at december  the accrual for workers compensation is based on an internally prepared actuarial model reviewed by an actuary 
as of december  and  we had million and million accrued  respectively  for incurred but not reported professional liability claims and retentions  net of related insurance recovery receivable 
the accrual for professional liability is based on an internally prepared actuarial model which is reviewed by an independent actuary 
refer to legal proceedings for more information about specific material litigation 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments  which results in a provision for bad debt expense 
we determine the adequacy of this allowance by continually evaluating individual customer receivables  considering the customer s financial condition  credit history and current economic conditions 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we write off specific accounts based on an ongoing review of collectibility as well as our past experience with the customer 
historically  losses on uncollectible accounts have not exceeded our allowances 
as of december   our allowance for doubtful accounts was million 
we are subject to various claims and legal actions in the ordinary course of our business 
some of these matters include professional liability and employee related matters 
our healthcare facility clients may also become subject to claims  governmental inquiries and investigations and legal actions to which we may become a party relating to services provided by our professionals 
from time to time  and depending upon the particular facts and circumstances  we may be subject to indemnification obligations under our contracts with our healthcare facility clients relating to these matters 
material pending legal proceedings brought against the company  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business are described in legal proceedings 
maureen petray and carina higareda v

medstaff  inc  cross country healthcare  inc  victor kalafa  tim rodden  talia pico and melissa hetrick  subject to the company s ability to move for decertification at a later stage in the proceedings 
the court  however  limited the scope of the preliminarily certified collective action to encompass claims occurring within a year statute of limitations and limited to days the period of time within which putative members of the preliminarily certified collective action group may opt into the action 
the court denied certification of a class action pursuant to fed

adoption of fasb statement no 
revised on january   we adopted fasb statement no 
r using the modified prospective method 
fasb statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values 
under the modified prospective approach  the recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
r are applied prospectively 
for prior periods  companies are required to disclose the pro forma impact of adopting the standard for prior periods 
all of our options outstanding as of december  were fully vested as a result of the decision to accelerate the vesting of any unvested options as of december  a total of  options  with a weighted average exercise price of per share  were accelerated 
of these options  had exercise prices below market value in the money options as of december  the reason for the acceleration was to avoid recognizing associated compensation expense for these options in future periods consolidated statements of income 
we estimate the pre tax charge avoided in future periods by the acceleration of these options to be approximately million excluding the impact of forfeitures 
in conjunction with the acceleration  we recorded a pre tax charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to the acceleration of in the money options we estimated would not have otherwise vested 
this charge was included in selling  general  and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of income 
we expect there to be no further impact  from the share based payments that were outstanding as of december   on our consolidated statements of income 
however  stock based compensation expense could become material to us depending on the number of options or other forms of equity based compensation that are granted in the future 
we used the black scholes method for disclosures prior to adoption 
after reviewing alternative valuation methods  we selected to continue using the black scholes method based on our prior experience with it  and its wide use by other issuers comparable to us 
we will consider the use of another model if additional information becomes available in the future that indicates another model would be more appropriate for us  or  if grants issued in future periods have characteristics that cannot be reasonably estimated using black scholes 
there is no material impact on the consolidated financial statements resulting from the adoption of fasb statement no 
r for the year december  due to the small number of options granted in see note stockholders equity 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

fin 
fin creates a single model to address uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that we recognize in our financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
the provisions of fin became effective for us on january   with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  if any  recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting fin and its impact on our financial position  cash flows  and results of operations 
inflation during the last several years  the rate of inflation in healthcare related services has exceeded that of the economy as a whole 
this inflation has increased our direct operating costs 
we are also impacted by fluctuations in housing costs and recently by increases in costs of professional  general and healthcare insurance 
depending on the demand environment  we may be able to recoup the negative impact of such fluctuations by increasing our billing rates 
we may not be able to continue increasing our billing rates and increases in our direct operating costs may adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  our clients are impacted by payments of healthcare reimbursements by federal and state governments as well as private insurers
