item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
this report and our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain forward looking statements  which generally include the plans and objectives of management for future operations  including plans and objectives relating to our future economic performance and our current beliefs regarding revenues we might generate and profits we might earn if we are successful in implementing our business and growth strategies 
the forward looking statements and associated risks may include  relate to or be qualified by other important factors  including  without limitation fluctuations in the market price of ethanol and its co products  the projected growth or contraction in the ethanol and co product market in which we operate  our strategies for expanding  maintaining or contracting our presence in these markets  our ability to successfully develop  finance  construct and operate our planned ethanol production facilities  anticipated trends in our financial condition and results of operations  and our ability to distinguish ourselves from our current and future competitors 
we do not undertake to update  revise or correct any forward looking statements 
any of the factors described above or in the risk factors section above could cause our financial results  including our net income or loss or growth in net income or loss to differ materially from prior results  which in turn could  among other things  cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
overview our primary goal is to become the leading marketer and producer of renewable fuels in the western united states 
we produce and sell ethanol and its co products and provide transportation  storage and delivery of ethanol through third party service providers in the western united states  primarily in california  nevada  arizona  washington  oregon and colorado 
we have extensive customer relationships throughout the western united states and extensive supplier relationships throughout the western and midwestern united states 
in october  we completed construction of an ethanol production facility with nameplate annual production capacity of million gallons located in madera  california  and began producing ethanol 
in october  we also acquired approximately of the outstanding membership interests of front range energy  llc  or front range  which owns and operates an ethanol production facility with nameplate annual production capacity of million gallons located in windsor  colorado 
in addition  we are currently constructing or in advanced stages of development of four additional ethanol production facilities 
we also intend to construct or otherwise acquire additional ethanol production facilities as financial resources and business prospects make the construction or acquisition of these facilities advisable 
see business production facilities below 
total annual gasoline consumption in the united states is approximately billion gallons 
total annual ethanol consumption currently represents less than of annual gasoline consumption  or approximately billion gallons of ethanol 
we believe that the domestic ethanol industry has substantial potential for growth to reach what we estimate is an achievable level of at least of the total annual gasoline consumption in the united states  or approximately billion gallons of ethanol 
in california alone  an increase in the consumption of ethanol from california s current level of  or approximately billion gallons of ethanol per year  to at least of total annual gasoline consumption would result in consumption of approximately million additional gallons of ethanol  representing an increase in annual ethanol consumption in california alone of approximately and an increase in annual ethanol consumption in the entire united states of approximately 
we intend to achieve our goal of becoming the leading marketer and producer of renewable fuels in the western united states in part by expanding our production capacity to million gallons of annual production capacity by the second quarter of and million gallons of annual production capacity by the end of we intend to achieve this goal in part also by expanding our relationships with third party ethanol producers to market higher volumes of ethanol throughout the western united states  expanding our relationships with animal feed distributors and end users to build local markets for wet distillers grains  or wdg  the primary co product of our ethanol production  and expanding the market for ethanol by continuing to work with state governments to encourage the adoption of policies and standards that promote ethanol as a fuel additive and ultimately as a primary transportation fuel 
we also intend to expand our distribution infrastructure by expanding our ability to provide transportation  storage and related logistical services to our customers throughout the western united states 
financial performance summary our net sales increased by million  or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  our net loss decreased by million to  for from a net loss of million for the following factors contributed to our operating results for net sales 
our increase in net sales in as compared to was primarily due to the following combination of factors o higher sales volumes 
total volume of ethanol sold as a principal and an agent increased by million gallons  or  to million gallons for from million gallons for the substantial increase in sales volume is primarily due to additional supply provided under our ethanol marketing agreements and the commencement of ethanol production 
o commencement of ethanol production 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced producing ethanol and its co products at our madera facility and  based on our ownership interest in front range  began recording a proportionate amount of its net sales 
the production and sale of ethanol and its co products at our madera facility and through front range contributed an aggregate of million in sales for o higher ethanol prices 
our average sales price of ethanol increased by per gallon  or  to per gallon for all gallons sold as a principal and an agent for as compared to per gallon for o partial period comparison 
our results of operations for  including our net sales  include our operations and those of all of our wholly owned subsidiaries  including kinergy marketing  llc  or kinergy  for that entire period 
however  our results of operations for  including our net sales  exclude kinergy s net sales for the period from january  through march  in the amount of million 
see share exchange transaction below 
gross profit 
our gross profit margin increased to for as compared to a gross profit margin of for this increase was primarily due to locking in favorable margins through purchase and sale commitments consistent with our risk management guidelines at various times during the increase in our gross profit margins was also due to sales resulting from ethanol production  which typically generates higher gross profits than ethanol marketing arrangements  at our madera facility and also through front range 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in  however  these expenses decreased as a percentage of our net sales due to our substantial growth in net sales 
our selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of net sales in as compared to of net sales in sales and margins historically  we have generated all of our revenues from marketing ethanol produced by third parties 
however  in the fourth quarter of  we began generating revenues from the production and sale of ethanol and its co products as a result of the commencement of operations at our madera facility and our interest in front range 
we have three principal methods of selling ethanol as a merchant  as a producer and as an agent 
see critical accounting policies revenue recognition below 
when acting as a merchant or as a producer  we generally enter into sales contracts having a typical term of six months to ship ethanol to a customer s desired location 
we support these sales contracts through purchase contracts with several third party suppliers or through our own production 
we manage the necessary logistics to deliver ethanol to our customers either directly from a third party supplier or from our inventory via truck or rail 
our sales as a merchant or as a producer expose us to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol 
our exposure varies depending on the magnitude of our sales commitments compared to the magnitude of our purchase commitments and existing inventory  as well as the pricing terms such as market index or fixed pricing of our contracts 
we seek to mitigate our exposure to price risks by implementing appropriate risk management strategies 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we conduct back to back purchases and sales in which we match ethanol purchase and sale contracts of like quantities and delivery periods 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we receive a predetermined service fee and we have little or no exposure to price risks resulting from potential fluctuations in the market price of ethanol 
prior to  kinergy s gross profit margins for marketing ethanol produced by third parties averaged between and 
gross profit margins above this historical range generally result when we are able to correctly anticipate and benefit from holding a net long position ie  volume on purchase commitments  together with existing inventory  exceeds volume on sales commitments while ethanol prices are rising  or holding a net short position ie  volume on sales commitments exceeds volume on purchase commitments and existing inventory while ethanol prices are declining 
gross profit margins below this historical range generally result when a net long or short position is held and there is a sustained adverse movement in market prices 
the market price of ethanol has recently experienced significant fluctuations 
for example  kinergy s average sales price per gallon of ethanol declined by approximately from its average sales price in the five months from january through may and reversed this decline and increased to approximately above kinergy s average sales price in the four months from june through september  and from september through december  our average sales price per gallon of ethanol trended downward but reversed its trend by rising approximately above our average sales price by the end of fluctuations in the market price of ethanol may cause our results of operations to fluctuate significantly 
we believe that our gross profit margins will primarily depend on four key factors the market price of ethanol  which we believe will be impacted by the degree of competition in the ethanol market  the price of gasoline and related petroleum products  and government regulation  including tax incentives  the market price of key production input commodities  including corn and natural gas  our ability to anticipate trends in the market price of ethanol  wdg  and key input commodities and implement appropriate risk management and opportunistic strategies  and the proportion of our sales of ethanol produced at our facilities to our sales of ethanol produced by third parties 
we believe that our gross profit margins will also depend on the market price of wdg 
management seeks to optimize our gross profit margins by anticipating the factors above and implementing hedging transactions and taking other actions designed to limit risk and address the various factors 
for example  we may seek to decrease inventory levels in anticipation of declining ethanol prices and increase inventory levels in anticipation of increasing ethanol prices 
we may also seek to alter our proportion or timing  or both  of purchase and sales commitments 
our inability to anticipate the factors above or their relative importance  and adverse movements in the factors themselves  could result in declining or even negative gross profit margins over certain periods of time 
our ability to anticipate those factors or favorable movements in the factors themselves may enable us to generate above average gross profit margins 
however  given the difficulty associated with successfully forecasting any of these factors  we are unable to estimate our future gross profit margins 
acquisition of front range on october   we entered into a membership interest purchase agreement with eagle energy to acquire eagle energy s interest in front range 
as consideration for the acquisition of eagle energy s interest in front range  we paid to eagle energy cash of million  issued  shares of common stock valued at million under the valuation provisions of the agreement and issued a warrant to purchase up to  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrant had a fair value of million 
the warrant expires october  share exchange transaction on march   we completed a share exchange transaction  or share exchange transaction  with the shareholders of pacific ethanol  inc  a california corporation  or pei california  and the holders of the membership interests of each of kinergy  and reenergy  llc  or reenergy 
upon completion of the share exchange transaction  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of pei california and all of the outstanding membership interests of each of kinergy and reenergy 
immediately prior to the consummation of the share exchange transaction  our predecessor  accessity corp  a new york corporation  or accessity  reincorporated in the state of delaware under the name pacific ethanol  inc critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
we consider revenue realized or realizable and earned when it has persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured in conformity with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of ethanol and related co products 
we recognize revenue when title transfers to our customers  which is generally upon the delivery of these products to a customer s designated location 
these deliveries are made in accordance with sales commitments and related sales orders entered into with customers either verbally or in written form 
the sales commitments and related sales orders provide quantities  pricing and conditions of sales 
in this regard  we engage in three basic types of revenue generating transactions as a merchant 
sales as a merchant consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which we may or may not obtain physical control of the ethanol or co products  though ultimately titled to us  in which shipments are directed from our suppliers to our terminals or direct to our customers but for which we accept the risk of loss in the transactions 
as a producer 
sales as a producer consist of sales of our inventory produced at our facilities  including by front range 
as an agent 
sales as an agent consist of sales to customers through purchases from third party suppliers in which  depending upon the terms of the transactions  title to the product may technically pass to us  but risk of loss in the transactions does not since all transacted sales prices flow back to our third party suppliers 
when acting as an agent for third party suppliers  we conduct back to back purchases and sales in which we match ethanol purchase and sales contracts of like quantities and delivery periods 
we receive a predetermined service fee under these transactions and therefore act predominantly in an agency capacity 
we have employed the principles detailed in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  as guidance in our revenue recognition policies 
revenue from sales of third party ethanol and its co products is recorded net of costs when we are is acting as an agent between the customer and supplier and gross when we are a principal to the transaction 
several factors are considered to determine whether we are is acting as an agent or principal  most notably whether we are the primary obligor to the customer  whether we have inventory risk and related risk of loss or whether we add meaningful value to the vendor s product or service 
consideration is also given to whether we have has latitude in establishing the sales price or have credit risk  or both 
we record revenues based upon the gross amounts billed to our customers in transactions where we act as a producer or a merchant and obtain title to ethanol and its co products and therefore own the product and any related  unmitigated inventory risk for the ethanol  regardless of whether we actually obtain physical control of the product 
when we act in an agency capacity  we record revenues on a net basis  or our predetermined agency fees only  based upon the amount of net revenues retained in excess of amounts paid to suppliers 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
we have determined that front range meets the definition of a variable interest entity under the financial accounting standards board s fasb financial interpretation no 
fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
we are therefore required to treat front range as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes rather than use equity investment accounting treatment 
we determined that we had become the primary beneficiary of the variable interest entity as of october   the date we acquired our ownership interest in front range 
under fin r  and as long as we are deemed the primary beneficiary of front range  we must treat front range as a consolidated subsidiary for financial reporting purposes 
therefore  we restated the assets  liabilities  and the non controlling interests of front range to fair market values consistent with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocated the purchase price to the tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over the fair value was recorded as goodwill 
the following summarizes our estimated fair values of the front range tangible and intangible assets and liabilities acquired in thousands cash and cash equivalents investments accounts receivable inventories other current assets property and equipment other long term assets intangibles customer backlog intangibles non compete covenants goodwill current portion of long term debt accounts payable and accrued expenses long term debt non controlling interest in variable interest entity net assets impairment of intangible and long lived assets our intangible assets  including goodwill  were derived from the acquisition of our interest in front range in and our acquisition of kinergy in in connection with the share exchange transaction 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocated the respective purchase prices to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired based upon their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase prices over the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded as goodwill 
our long lived assets are primarily associated with our madera and front range ethanol production facilities 
the long lived assets attributable to front range were recorded as a result of the determination of our status as the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and the resulting consolidated accounting treatment 
we account for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
we review goodwill and intangible assets at least annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
in our review  we determine the fair value of these intangibles using market multiples and discounted cash flow modeling and compare it to the net book value of the acquired assets 
any assessed impairments will be recorded permanently and expensed in the period in which the impairment is determined 
if it is determined through our assessment process that any of our intangible assets require impairment charges  they will be recorded in the line item other operating charges in the consolidated statement of operations 
we performed our annual review of impairment and we have not recognized any impairment losses on any of our intangible assets through december  we evaluate impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that suggest the fair value of assets could be less then their net book value 
in such event  we assess long lived assets for impairment by determining their fair value based on the forecasted  undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate plus the net proceeds expected from the sale of the asset 
an impairment loss would be recognized when the fair value is less than the related asset s net book value  and an impairment expense would be recorded in the amount of the difference 
forecasts of future cash flows are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of our operations and the industries in which we operate 
these forecasts could be significantly affected by future changes in market conditions  the economic environment  and capital spending decisions of our customers and inflation 
we have not recognized any impairment losses on long lived assets through december  stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for employee stock compensation cost pursuant to sfas no 
revised  share based payments 
prior to that date  we used the intrinsic value method under accounting policy board opinion no 
to recognize compensation cost 
under the method of accounting for the change to the fair value method  compensation cost recognized in is the same amount that would have been recognized if the fair value method would have been used for all awards granted 
the effects on net income and earnings per share had the fair value method been applied to all outstanding and unvested awards in each period are reflected in note of the financial statements 
our assumptions made for purposes of estimating the fair value of our stock options  as well as a summary of the activity under our stock option plan are included in note of the financial statements 
we account for the stock options granted to non employees in accordance with eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and sfas no 
r 
derivative instruments and hedging activities our business and activities expose us to a variety of market risks  including risks related to changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we monitor and manage these financial exposures as an integral part of our risk management program 
this program recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility could have on operating results 
we account for our use of derivatives related to our hedging activities pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in which we recognize all of our derivative instruments in our statement of financial position as either assets or liabilities  depending on the rights or obligations under the contracts 
we have designated and documented contracts for the physical delivery of commodity products to and from counterparties as normal purchases and normal sales 
derivative instruments are measured at fair value  pursuant to the definition found in sfas no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
changes in the derivative s fair value are recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative s effective gains and losses to be deferred in other comprehensive income and later recorded together with the gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged item in the income statement 
companies must formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
the estimated gains losses on our derivatives as of december  and are as follows in thousands commodity futures commodity options interest rate options total allowance for doubtful accounts we primarily sell ethanol to gasoline refining and distribution companies 
we also sell wdg to dairy operators and animal feed distributors 
we had significant concentrations of credit risk as of december   as described in note of our consolidated financial statements 
however  those customers historically have had good credit ratings and historically we have collected amounts that were billed to those customers 
receivables from customers are generally unsecured 
we continuously monitor our customer account balances and actively pursue collections on past due balances 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for balances that appear to have specific collection issues 
our collection process is based on the age of the invoice and requires attempted contacts with the customer at specified intervals 
if after a specified number of days  we have been unsuccessful in our collection efforts  we consider recording a bad debt allowance for the balance at question 
we would eventually write off accounts included in our allowance when we have determined that collection is not likely 
the factors considered in reaching this determination are the apparent financial condition of the customer  and our success in contacting and negotiating with the customer 
costs of start up activities start up activities are defined broadly in statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities  as those one time activities related to opening a new facility  introducing a new product or service  conducting business in a new territory  conducting business with a new class of customer or beneficiary  initiating a new process in an existing facility  commencing some new operation or activities related to organizing a new entity 
our start up activities consist primarily of costs associated with new or potential sites for ethanol production facilities 
we expense all the costs associated with a potential site  until the site is consider viable by management  at which time costs would be considered for capitalization based on authoritative accounting literature 
these costs are included in selling  general  and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of operations 
results of operations the tables presented below  which compare our results of operations from one period to another  present the results for each period  the change in those results from one period to another in both dollars and percentage change  and the results for each period as a percentage of net sales 
the columns present the following the first two data columns in the tables show the absolute results for each period presented 
the columns entitled dollar variance and percentage variance show the change in results  both in dollars and percentages 
these two columns show favorable changes as a positive and unfavorable changes as negative 
for example  when our net sales increase from one period to the next  that change is shown as a positive number in both columns 
conversely  when expenses increase from one period to the next  that change is shown as a negative in both columns

various factors materially affect the comparability of the information presented in the above table 
these factors relate primarily to the share exchange transaction 
as a result of the share exchange transaction  our results of operations for include the operations of kinergy from only march through december  kinergy s net sales for the period from january through march  were approximately million and  along with other components of kinergy s results of operations  are not included in our results of operations for in the above table 
our results of operations for consist of our operations and all of our wholly owned subsidiaries  including kinergy  for that entire period 
net sales 
the increase in our net sales in as compared to was predominantly due to increased sales volume and increased average sales prices 
during  total volume of ethanol sold as a principal and an agent increased by million gallons  or  to million gallons as compared to million gallons for for  our average sales price of ethanol increased by per gallon  or  to per gallon for all gallons sold as a principal and an agent as compared to per gallon for the substantial increase in sales volume is primarily due to additional supply provided under our ethanol marketing agreements and the commencement of ethanol production 
in the fourth quarter of  we commenced producing ethanol and its co products at our madera facility and  based on our ownership interest in front range  began recording a proportionate amount of its net sales 
the production and sale of ethanol and its co products at our madera facility and through front range contributed an aggregate of million in sales for gross profit 
the increase in gross profit  both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales  in as compared to is generally reflective of more advantageous buying and selling during a period of increasing market prices as well as the commencement of ethanol production at our madera facility and our acquisition of a interest in front range  both of which occurred in the fourth quarter of we established and maintained net long ethanol positions during much of the decision to maintain net long ethanol positions was reached in accordance with our risk management program and was based on a confluence of factors  including management s expectation of increased prices of gasoline and petroleum and the continued phase out of methyl tertiary butyl ether  or mtbe  blending which we believed would result in a significant increase in demand for blending ethanol with gasoline 
future gross profit margins will vary based upon  among other things  the size and timing of our net long or short positions during our various contract periods and the volatility of the market price of ethanol 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to a  increase in payroll and benefits related to the hiring of additional staff positions  a  increase in legal  accounting and consulting fees  a  increase in additional non cash director and consulting expenses  a  increase in depreciation and amortization  a  increase in insurance expense primarily related to increased directors and officers insurance costs  a  increase in general office and administrative expenses  a  increase in costs related to internal controls and procedures in connection with the sarbanes oxley act of  a  increase in travel and entertainment  a  increase in investor relations expense  a  increase in supplies and repair and maintenance related to the madera facility  a  increase in hardware  software  and other information technology related expenses  a  increase in taxes  licenses  and fees  an  increase in trade association dues and memberships  a  increase in advertising and promotion  and a  decrease in all other selling  general  and administrative expenses 
we expect that over the near term  our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in terms of actual expenditures as a result of  among other things  increased legal and accounting fees associated with increased corporate governance activities related to the sarbanes oxley act of  recently adopted rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  increased employee costs associated with planned staffing increases  increased sales and marketing expenses  increased activities related to the construction of ethanol production facilities and increased activity in searching for and analyzing potential acquisitions 
however  we expect that over the near term  our selling  general and administrative expenses will decrease as a percentage of net sales due to our expected sales growth 
other income expense  net 
other income increased during as compared to  primarily due to a  increase in interest income associated with the significant increase in our cash position due to the sale of shares of our common stock in may and shares of our series a preferred stock in april   in deferred financing cost amortization related to potential plant expansion financing  and  in interest expense related to notes payable attributable to front range 
other changes included a  increase in capitalized interest related to a loan for the construction of our madera production facility  a  decrease in penalties and fines expenses and a  increase in all other categories 
non controlling interest in variable interest entity 
non controlling interest in variable interest entity was  this amount relates to our consolidated treatment of our variable interest entity  front range  and represents the non controlling interests in the earnings of front range 
preferred stock dividends 
shares of our series a cumulative redeemable convertible preferred stock  or series a preferred stock  are entitled to quarterly cumulative dividends payable in arrears in cash in an amount equal to per annum of the purchase price per share of the series a preferred stock  or at our option  be paid in additional shares of series a preferred stock based on the value of the purchase price per share of the series a preferred stock 
in  we declared cash dividends on shares of our series a preferred stock in the aggregate amount of  deemed dividend on preferred stock 
we have recorded a deemed dividend on preferred stock in our financial statements for the year ended december  this non cash dividend is to reflect the implied economic value to the preferred stockholder of being able to convert its shares into common stock at a price which is in excess of the fair value of the series a preferred stock 
the fair value allocated to the series a preferred stock together with the original conversion terms were used to calculate the value of the deemed dividend on the series a preferred stock of million at the date of issuance 
the fair value was calculated using the difference between the agreed upon conversion price of the series a preferred stock into shares of common stock of per share and the fair market value of our common stock of on the date of issuance of the series a preferred stock 
the fair value allocated to the series a preferred stock was in excess of the gross proceeds received of million in connection with the sale of the series a preferred stock  however  the deemed dividend on the series a preferred stock is limited to the gross proceeds received of million 
the deemed dividend on preferred stock is a reconciling item and adjusts our reported net loss  together with the preferred stock dividends discussed above  to loss available to common stockholders

our net sales increased by approximately million in as compared to this increase was almost entirely due to the acquisition of kinergy on march  without the acquisition of kinergy  our net sales would have been  in gross profit 
our increase in gross profit was primarily due to the acquisition of kinergy on march  prior to  kinergy s gross profit margins for marketing ethanol produced by third parties averaged between and 
gross profit margins above this historical average range have generally resulted after correctly anticipating and benefiting from holding a net long position ie  volume on purchase contracts  together with inventory  exceeds volume on sales contracts while ethanol prices are rising  or holding a net short position ie  volume on sales contracts exceeds volume on purchase contracts and inventory while ethanol prices are declining 
gross profit margins below the historical average range have generally resulted when a net long or short position was held and there was a sustained adverse movement in market prices 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses during as compared to was primarily due to  in additional legal  accounting and consulting fees   in abandoned debt financing fees   in additional amortization of intangibles and  in additional payroll expense related to the three executive employment agreements that became effective upon the consummation of the share exchange transaction on march   the addition of two staff positions in may and june  an employee promotion in may  the addition of two executive positions in june  the addition of two high level ethanol plant management positions in september and the addition of three additional staff positions in the fourth quarter of additionally  non cash compensation and consulting fees increased  for non cash compensation from stock grants in connection with the hiring of two employees   for a stock grant that vested upon closing of the share exchange transaction on march    for non cash consulting fees related to stock options granted to a consulting firm in connection with the employment of our chief financial officer   for non cash compensation related to stock options granted in connection with the hiring of two ethanol plant managers   for non cash compensation related to stock options granted to reward employees for past performance   for non cash consulting fees related to warrants that were granted in february and vested over one year  and  for non cash consulting fees related to warrants that were granted in connection with the share exchange transaction that vest ratably over two years 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was also due to  in additional insurance expense related primarily to liability and property coverage for our madera construction site  a  increase in non sales commission expense related to insurance proceeds for the casualty loss at the company s madera facility  a  increase for expenses related to the termination of the proposed acquisition of pbi  a  increase in business travel expenses  a  increase in research and development expense  a  increase in market and filing fees  a  increase in policy and investor relations expenses  a  increase in rents  a  increase in advertising and marketing expense  an  increase in dues and trade memberships  a  increase in printing and postage expense  a  increase in telephone expense  a  increase in bad debt expense  and the net balance of  related to various increases in other selling  general and administrative expenses 
other income expense  net 
other income increased during as compared to primarily due to a  increase in interest income on cash held in seven day investment accounts   in management fees and other income  a net decrease of  in interest expense related to long term debt  amortization of discount  and construction payables  net of capitalized interest related to our madera ethanol plant  all of which were partially offset by an increase of  in bank charges  finance charges  and short term interest and an increase in liquidated damages and fees paid to stockholders in the amount of  liquidity and capital resources during  we funded our operations primarily from our cash on hand  net income from the operations  and net proceeds from the issuance and sale of shares of our series a preferred stock and common stock  as well as the exercise of warrants and options to purchase shares of our common stock 
as of december   we had working capital of  representing an increase in working capital of  from negative working capital of  as of december  this increase in working capital is primarily due to a private offering of our common stock that we conducted in may in which we raised  in net proceeds 
our current available capital resources consist primarily of approximately  in cash and cash equivalents as of december  we expect that our future available capital resources will consist primarily of any balance of this cash and cash equivalents as of december   cash generated from operations  if any  unrestricted proceeds from the sale of our series a preferred stock  and any future debt and or equity financings 
we also have  of restricted funds remaining as of december  from the proceeds of the sale of our series a preferred stock 
these funds are held in a restricted funds account and are subject to restrictions which  among other things  limit the requisition of funds only for the payment of costs in connection with the construction or acquisition of ethanol production facilities 
accounts receivable increased  during from  as of december  to  as of december  this increase is primarily due to a increase in our net sales for over inventory balances increased  during  from  as of december  to  as of december  as of december   there was significant inventory in transit prepaid inventory due to logistical delays in delivery to our inventory terminal locations 
the increased inventory balance as of december  reflects a return to a more typical balance between inventory in transit and actual inventory on hand 
other current assets increased  during  from  as of december  to  as of december  the increase is primarily related to a  increase in deferred financing fees 
property and equipment increased  during from  as of december  to  as of december  this increase is primarily due to our construction activities at our plants under development and our acquisition of our interest in front range 
total tangible other assets increased  during from  as of december  to  as of december  the increase is primarily due to an increase in restricted cash from the sale of our series a preferred stock  and advances made for equipment  and deferred financing fees related to our april debt financing 
cash used in our operating activities totaled  for as compared to  generated in this  increase in use of cash is primarily due to a  increase in accounts receivable  a  increase in inventory and a  increase in prepaid expenses and other assets  partially offset by a  increase in accounts payable 
cash used in our investing activities totaled  for as compared to  for included in the results for is  in restricted cash designated for construction projects and acquisitions   in cash used for additions to property  plant  and equipment reflecting activities associated with our plants under development and  in purchases of available for sale investments 
cash provided by our financing activities totaled  for as compared to  for this significant increase is related to proceeds from our private offerings of series a preferred stock and common stock in april and may  respectively  as well as from the exercise of warrants and stock options 
the amount for includes the proceeds from the sale of our common stock in march we believe that current and future available capital resources  revenues generated from operations and other existing sources of liquidity  including proceeds from our new debt financing described below  proceeds remaining from our private offerings of series a preferred stock in april and common stock in may described below  and distributions  if any  as a result of our ownership interest in front range  will be adequate to meet our anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if  however  our capital requirements or cash flow vary materially from our current projections  if unforeseen circumstances occur or if we require a significant amount of cash to fund future acquisitions  we may require additional financing 
our failure to raise capital  if needed  could restrict our growth or hinder our ability to compete 
new debt financing in february  we closed a debt financing transaction  or debt financing  in the aggregate amount of up to  through certain of our wholly owned indirect subsidiaries  or the borrowers 
the primary purpose of the credit facility is to provide debt financing in connection with the development  construction  installation  engineering  procurement  design  testing  start up  operation and maintenance of five ethanol production facilities 
the debt financing includes i a construction loan facility in an aggregate amount of up to  that matures on the earlier of october  and the date  or conversion date  the construction loans made thereunder are converted into term loans  and ii a term loan facility in an aggregate amount of up to  that matures on the date that is months after the conversion date  and iii a working capital and letter of credit facility in an aggregate amount of up to  that matures on the date that is months after the conversion date

loans made under the construction loan or the term loan facility may not be re borrowed once repaid or prepaid 
loans made under the construction loan facility do not amortize  and are fully due and payable on their maturity date 
the term loan facility is intended to refinance the loans made under the construction loan facility 
loans made under the term loan facility amortize at a rate of per annum from and after the conversion date  and the remaining principal amounts are fully due and payable on their maturity date 
loans made under the working capital and letter of credit facility are fully due and payable on their maturity date 
the borrowers have the option to select floating or periodic fixed rate loans under the debt financing 
depending upon the type of loan and whether the loan is made under the construction loan facility  the term loan facility or the working capital and letter of credit facility  loans under the debt financing bear interest at rates ranging from to over the selected fixed or floating interest rate 
interest on floating rate loans is payable quarterly in arrears  while interest on the various fixed rate loans available under the credit facility is payable quarterly or earlier if at the end of selected interest periods ranging from one to six months 
borrowings and the borrowers other obligations under the debt financing are secured by a first priority security interest in all of the equity interests in the borrowers and substantially all the assets of the borrowers

loans and letters of credit under the credit facility are also generally not available for the madera plant or the boardman plant until its completion 
also  the borrowers may not be able to fully utilize the credit facility if the completed ethanol plants fail to meet certain minimum performance standards 
finally  disbursements from the construction and term facility are limited to a percentage of project costs of the corresponding plant and in any event are not to exceed approximately per gallon of annual production capacity of the plant 
we expect to achieve a senior debt to equity ratio of approximately upon commencement of commercial operations of each of the madera and boardman ethanol plants 
we expect to achieve a senior debt to equity ratio of approximately during the construction phase of each of the burley  and brawley ethanol plants and another plant in california  the location of which is yet to be announced 
upon commencement of commercial operations of each of these plants  we expect to draw additional funds to increase the senior debt to equity ratio to approximately in connection with the debt financing  we have also entered into a sponsor support agreement under which we are to provide limited contingent equity support in connection with the development  construction  installation  engineering  procurement  design  testing  start up and maintenance of five ethanol production facilities

we have agreed to provide a warranty with respect to all ethanol plants other than our madera facility 
the term of the warranty is one year from the date the ethanol plant achieves commercial operations 
our obligations under the warranty are capped at the sponsor funding cap

effects of inflation the impact of inflation has not been significant on our financial condition or results of operations or those of our operating subsidiaries 
impact of new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
permits an entity to irrevocably elect fair value on a contract by contract basis as the initial and subsequent measurement attribute for many financial assets and liabilities and certain other items including insurance contracts 
entities electing the fair value option would be required to recognize changes in fair value in earnings and to expense upfront cost and fees associated with the item for which the fair value option is elected 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the entity also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting sfas no 
on our financial condition or results of operations 
in september  the securities and exchange commission issued sab no 
 topic n  financial statements considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in the current year financial statements 
sab no 
addresses how to quantify the effect of an error on the financial statements and requires a dual approach to compute the materiality of the misstatement 
specifically  the amount of the misstatement is to be computed using both the rollover ie  the current year income statement perspective and the iron curtain ie  the year end balance sheet perspective 
sab no 
is effective for all fiscal years ending after november   and accordingly  we adopted sab no 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal the adoption of sab no 
did not have a material impact on our financial condition or our results of operations 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
this new statement provides a single definition of fair value  together with a framework for measuring it  and requires additional disclosure about the use of fair value to measure assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also emphasizes that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  and sets out a fair value hierarchy with the highest priority being quoted prices in active markets 
the required effective date of sfas no 
is the first quarter of we are currently evaluating the impact this statement may have on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp aug air  accounting for planned major maintenance activities 
the principal source of guidance on the accounting for planned major maintenance activities is the airline guide 
the airline guide permitted four alternative methods of accounting for planned major maintenance activities direct expense  built in overhaul  deferral and accrual accrue in advance 
fsp aug air amended the airline guide by prohibiting the use of the accrue in advance method of accounting for planned major maintenance activities in annual and interim financial reporting periods 
the required effective date of fsp aug air is the first quarter of we do not anticipate fsp aug air to have a material affect on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
this interpretation prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the interpretation contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  and other matters 
these provisions are effective for us beginning in the first quarter of we are assessing the impact of this statement and currently do not believe that the adoption will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain hybrid financial instruments  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
specifically  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to permit fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument with an embedded derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation  provided the whole instrument is accounted for on a fair value basis 
additionally  sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to allow a qualifying special purpose entity to hold a derivative financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument 
sfas no 
applies to all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after september   with early application allowed 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices 
in the ordinary course of business  we enter into various types of transactions involving financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
commodity risk cash flow hedges as part of our risk management strategy  we use derivative instruments to protect cash flows from fluctuations caused by volatility in commodity prices for periods of up to twelve months 
these hedging activities are conducted to protect gross margins to reduce the potentially adverse effects that market volatility could have on operating results by minimizing our exposure to price volatility on ethanol sale and purchase commitments where the price is to be set at a future date and or if the contract specifies a floating or index based price for ethanol that is based on either the new york mercantile exchange price of gasoline or the chicago board of trade price of ethanol 
in addition  we hedge anticipated sales of ethanol to minimize our exposure to the potentially adverse effects of price volatility 
these derivatives are designated and documented as sfas no 
cash flow hedges and effectiveness is evaluated by assessing the probability of the anticipated transactions and regressing commodity futures prices against our purchase and sales prices 
ineffectiveness  which is defined as the degree to which the derivative does not offset the underlying exposure  is recognized immediately in earnings 
for the year ended december   losses of ineffectiveness in the amount of  was recorded in cost of goods sold 
for the year ended december   an effective gain in the amount of  was recorded to revenue and an effective loss in the amount of  was recorded in cost of goods sold 
there was no ineffectiveness or effectiveness recorded for the year ended december  amounts remaining in other comprehensive income loss will be reclassified to earnings upon the recognition of the related purchase or sale 
other comprehensive gain in the amount of  associated with commodity cash flow hedges is expected to be recognized in income over the next twelve months 
the notional balance of these derivatives as of december  and were  and  respectively 
interest rate risk as part of our interest rate risk management strategy  we use derivative instruments to minimize significant unanticipated earnings fluctuations that may arise from rising variable interest rate costs associated with existing and anticipated borrowings 
to meet these objectives we purchased interest rate caps on the three month libor 
the rate for a notional balance ranging from to  is per annum 
the rate for a notional balance ranging from to  is per annum 
these derivatives are designated and documented as sfas no 
cash flow hedges and effectiveness is evaluated by assessing the probability of anticipated interest expense and regressing the historical value of the rates against the historical value in the existing and anticipated debt 
ineffectiveness  reflecting the degree to which the derivative does not offset the underlying exposure  is recognized immediately in earnings 
during the year ended december   ineffectiveness in the amount of  was recorded in interest expense 
there was no ineffectiveness recorded in the years ended december  and amounts remaining in other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings upon the recognition of the hedged interest expense 
for the year ending december   we anticipate reclassifying  to income associated with our cash flow interest rate caps 
front range  our variable interest entity  entered into an interest rate swap with a notional balance of  to provide a fixed rate of on its construction and term loan 
this interest rate swap is accounted for as a non designated derivative in accordance with sfas no 
whereby it is marked to fair value and changes in fair value are recorded to other expense 
for the year ended december   an amount of  was recorded to other expense 
we marked all of our derivative instruments to fair value at each period end  except for those derivative contracts which qualified for the normal purchase and sale exemption pursuant to sfas no 
according to our designation of the derivative  changes in the fair value of derivatives are reflected in net income or other comprehensive income 
other comprehensive income other comprehensive income relative to derivatives for the year ended december  is as follows in thousands commodity derivatives interest rate derivatives gain loss gain loss beginning balance  january  net changes less amount reclassified to revenue less amount reclassified to cost of goods sold less amount reclassified to other income expense ending balance  december  calculated on a pretax basis the estimated fair values of our derivatives as of december  and are as follows in thousands commodity futures interest rate options total material limitations the disclosures with respect to the above noted risks do not take into account the underlying commitments or anticipated transactions 
if the underlying items were included in the analysis  the gains or losses on the futures contracts may be offset 
actual results will be determined by a number of factors that are not generally under our control and could vary significantly from those factors disclosed 
we are exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on the above instruments  as well as credit or performance risk with respect to our hedged customers commitments 
although nonperformance is possible  we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of these parties
