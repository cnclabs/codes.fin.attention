this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains descriptions of our expectations regarding future trends affecting our business 
these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this document are made in reliance upon safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of item a of part i of this form k sets forth certain factors we believe could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated by the forward looking statements 
overview we are a medical device company focused on bringing solutions to interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists 
as a vertically integrated medical device company  we generate ideas and create new interventional medical devices  and then deliver those products directly to the physician through our direct domestic sales force and international distribution network 
we continue to develop new products and applications for our existing products 
recent events on january   we received approval from the united states food drug administration fda to launch the new version of our twin pass dual access catheter 
the original twin pass catheter was launched in january as a two lumen catheter designed to be used in conjunction with steerable guidewires to access discrete regions of the coronary and peripheral arterial vasculature 
the new version features a larger lumen that  in addition to the original clinical uses  allows the twin pass catheter to measure intra arterial pressures and deliver specialty guidewires into the distal vasculature 
on january   we entered into three separate agreements with king pharmaceuticals  inc king a license agreement  a device supply agreement and a thrombin jmi supply agreement 
we licensed exclusive rights to thrombix  thrombigel and thrombigel paste to king for million 
we will manufacture the licensed products under the device supply agreement 
the device supply agreement requires king to pay us two separate million milestone payments  one for the first commercial sale of thrombigel and or thrombix and one for the first commercial sale of thrombigel paste 
the device supply agreement requires us to make a one time payment of  to king if the fda does not approve the surgical indication of thrombigel and a one time payment of  to king if the fda does not approve the surgical indication of thrombigel paste 
we have also entered into a long term supply agreement with king for the supply of thrombin jmi 
on january   we received approval from the fda for our innerchange micro introducer catheter 
the innerchange is a kit of custom designed components that allows a physician to gain access and perform a diagnostic angiogram using one micro access needle stick 
the innerchange is available in both f and f versions with three different tip configurations for use in a variety of diagnostic catheterization procedures 
on december   we received approval from the fda for our pma supplement for the added indication for the use of the d stat flowable hemostat for the reduction in the incidence of clinically significant hematomas in the implantation of a pulse generator pacemaker or icd in anticoagulated patients 
the pateint  randomized  prospective  multi center clinical study showed a reduction in the incidence of clinically significant hematomas compared to the standard of care 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain items from our statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses research and development clinical and regulatory sales and marketing general and administrative thrombin qualification amortization of purchased technology total operating expenses operating loss interest income expense  net net loss our primary products are categorized into five product lines 
the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  net sales by product line along with the percent change from the previous year for years ended december  net sales percent change net sales percent change net sales percent change hemostat products extraction catheters vein products specialty catheters access products other total net sales year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in net sales was a result of an increased market penetration rate in all our products categories as well as the introduction of new products 
approximately of our net sales for the year ended december  were to customers in the united states and of the net sales were to customers in international markets 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  our selling mix continues to change as our lower margin products such as our vari lase products and pronto continue to outpace the d stat dry products in growth 
we expect gross margins to be in the range of to in as our selling mix continues to change and move toward our lower margin products such as the vari lase and pronto product lines 
the newer v version of the pronto has higher manufacturing costs than the original pronto 
research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of our continued emphasis on investment in research and development  including an increase to full time employees at december  versus at december   and the addition of current year stock based compensation expense 
we expect our normal research and development expenses to be approximately to of sales per quarter in as we continue to pursue additional new products at an expected rate of approximately two new products per year and we continue to move our longer term development projects forward 
research and development expenses will decline as a percent of sales throughout as our sales increase 
clinical and regulatory expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of increasing the number of full time employees to at december  versus at december  and the current year addition of stock based compensation expense 
the additional employees have been added to manage the additional clinical study activity started in and continuing through out during our clinical studies consisted of the pocket protector study for a new indication of our d stat flowable product and the d stat dry study to obtain clinical data to support growing sales of the d stat dry 
clinical and regulatory expenses fluctuate due to the timing of clinical and marketing studies 
we expect clinical and regulatory expenses to be approximately to of sales per quarter in as we continue to pursue additional new products at an expected rate of approximately two new products per year and we continue to move our longer term development projects forward 
sales and marketing expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the primary reason for the increase in sales and marketing expenses is the direct result of our increase in our direct sales force to employees at the end of compared to as of december   with the majority of the head count increase occurring in the latter half of our commissions also increased  or in compared to as our head count increased as well as our sales force did a better job of making their quotas 
the addition of stock based compensation expense also added  of expense in we expect to add approximately field sales employees during to complete our geographic coverage of the united states 
as a result  we expect our sales and marketing expenses to be between and of sales per quarter in sales and marketing expenses are expected to decline as a percent of sales throughout as our sales increase 
general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of higher legal fees relating to the diomed and vnus litigation see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k along with higher business insurance  the addition of stock based compensation expense in  and increasing the number of full time employees to at december  versus at december  we expect general and administrative expenses to be approximately to of sales per quarter in thrombin qualification project expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  on october   we entered into a supply agreement with sigma aldrich fine chemicals  an operating division of sigma aldrich  inc sigma for the supply of thrombin to us 
pursuant to the terms of the agreement  we will be paying for certain development costs of sigma to allow sigma to produce thrombin 
the initial contract term ends after ten years and is automatically extended for up to five additional successive one year terms unless one party delivers notice of termination at least one year prior to the scheduled termination of the agreement 
during the term of the agreement  sigma has agreed not to sell thrombin of the type developed for us under the agreement in or as a component of a hemostatic product for medical use 
we do not have any minimum purchase requirements under the agreement  however  if we purchase less than three lots of thrombin in any year starting in then sigma will be released from its agreement not to sell thrombin in or as a component of a hemostatic product for medical use  and sigma will have the right to terminate the agreement upon days notice 
the sigma contract is part of our plan to fully qualify a second source of thrombin in addition to the thrombin jmi supply agreement discussed in agreements with king pharmaceuticals above and to bring the new thrombin through the regulatory process to be used in our hemostatic products 
the payments associated with the sigma agreement are part of our total estimated expenditures of million to complete this project 
the costs and purchases incurred through december  and the total estimated costs and purchases for the thrombin project including costs and purchases already incurred are as follows incurred as of december  total estimated qualification expenses million million capital equipment purchases million million thrombin inventory purchases net of thrombin expensed million million million million we have expensed approximately  of the total million purchased of the sigma thrombin in our development work over the past two years leaving approximately million of thrombin in our inventory 
the million in thrombin is expected to be used in our hemostat products once we gain regulatory approval 
as described in agreements with king pharmaceuticals above  in january we entered into a new year thrombin supply agreement with king with a price fixed throughout the term  adjusted for a producer price index tied to pharmaceuticals 
the thrombin price under the agreement is confidential information  however  the price reflects a discount to the price we paid in the last year of our previous thrombin supply agreement with king 
the new agreement does not terminate or affect our ability to complete the qualification of our own second thrombin source  however  with the near term economic need to qualify a second source eliminated we will be able to evaluate and plan our continuing expenses and steps on this project 
we expect to incur approximately  of qualification expenses in amortization of purchased technology was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the amortization resulted from our acquisition of the acolysis assets from the secured creditors of angiosonics  inc we allocated  from the acquisition to purchased technology and were amortizing the amount over four years  which was completed in april interest income decreased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower cash balances maintained during the year 
interest expense increased to  for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  as a result of the borrowings on our equipment line of credit 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in net sales was a result of an increased market penetration rate in all our product categories as well as the introduction of new products 
approximately of our net sales for the year ended december  were to customers in the united states and of the net sales were to customers in international markets 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  our selling mix changed to our higher margin products such as our d stat dry  which has gross margins greater than 
research and development expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of our increased investment in research and development as well as our increase in head count to employees at december  versus at december  clinical and regulatory expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was the result of increased clinical study activity  increased fda fees and increased number of employees compared to during our clinical studies consisted of the pocket protector study for a new indication of our d stat flowable product and the d stat dry study to obtain clinical data to support growing sales of the d stat dry 
clinical and regulatory expenses fluctuate due to the timing of clinical and marketing studies 
sales and marketing expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses is the direct result of our increase in our direct sales force to employees at the end of compared to as of december  general and administrative expenses increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of higher legal fees relating to the diomed litigation see legal proceedings in item of part i of this form k along with higher business insurance and accounting fees in compared to thrombin qualification project expenses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  amortization of purchased technology was  for each of the years ended december  and the amortization resulted from our acquisition of the acolysis assets from the secured creditors of angiosonics  inc we allocated  from the acquisition to purchased technology and are amortizing the amount over four years 
interest income increased to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  primarily as a result of higher interest rates 
income taxes we have not generated any fiscal year pre tax income to date and therefore have not paid any federal income taxes since our inception in december no provision or benefit for federal and state income taxes has been recorded for net operating losses incurred in any period since our inception because the benefits may not be realized until and if we generate taxable income 
we have established a valuation allowance for the full value of our federal net operating loss  federal and state research and development credits and foreign tax losses 
as of december   we had approximately million of federal net operating loss carryforwards available to offset future taxable income which begin to expire in the year as of december   we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million which begin to expire in the year as of december   we also had a foreign tax loss carryforward of approximately million  which does not expire 
under the united states tax reform act of  the amounts of and benefits from net operating loss carryforwards may be impaired or limited in certain circumstances  including significant changes in ownership interests 
future use of our existing net operating loss carryforwards may be restricted due to changes in ownership or from future tax legislation 
we performed a section change in ownership study during the third quarter on our federal net operating loss carryforward  and concluded that  as of the date of this study  we would have no limitations on the net operating loss carryforward 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed substantially all of our operations since inception through the issuance of equity securities and  to a lesser extent  sales of our products 
through december   we have sold capital stock generating aggregate net proceeds of approximately million 
at december   we had  in cash and cash equivalents on hand compared to  at december  in january we received  upon the signing of the license agreement with king pharmaceuticals  inc during the year ended december   we used  in cash as a result of operating activities  we incurred net capital expenditures in the amount of  and we generated  in financing activities 
on january   we drew down million of the equipment line resulting in an increase of million of cash  net of debt payments 
the remaining  of financing activities was the result of the sale of common stock upon the exercise of outstanding stock options  exercise of stock warrants and issuances under employee stock plans 
our capital expenditures included software and equipment related to our new erp system  leasehold improvements and manufacturing equipment 
our operating cash usage was primarily the result of an increase of accounts receivable as our sales grew on a year over year basis in and a decrease in accounts payable since we paid for the million of sigma thrombin in january which was in our accounts payable at the end of we purchase our requirements for thrombin a component in the duett and d stat products under a purchase agreement dated january  see note to the consolidated financial statements with a subsidiary of king 
the agreement provides for a fixed price  with adjustments based on a producer price index tied to pharmaceuticals 
the previous agreement with king expired on may  in anticipation of the previous agreement expiring  we submitted purchase orders to king for approximately million of thrombin to benefit from the pricing provisions of the agreement 
as of december   we had purchase orders totaling million outstanding with king 
as part of the supply agreement dated january   the outstanding purchase orders were cancelled and new purchase orders were placed at the lower price of the new agreement 
we currently have a million credit facility with silicon valley bank 
the million revolving line of credit has a month term  bears interest at the rate of prime plus and is secured by a first security interest on all of our assets 
the million equipment line of credit has a month term  bears interest at the rate of prime plus and is secured by a first security interest on all of our assets used as collateral for the amounts borrowed on under the line 
the credit facility includes two covenants minimum tangible net worth of  through september    thereafter  and liquidity coverage of not less than to 
the minimum tangible net worth covenant will increase by the sum of of the company s quarterly net profit beginning with the quarter ending march  plus all consideration for equity securities received after december  we were in compliance with these covenants at december  as of december   we had no outstanding balance on the million revolving line of credit and the availability on the revolving line of credit was million 
on january   we drew down million of the equipment line 
as of december   we had a balance of  remaining on the equipment line 
the following table summarizes our contractual cash commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years facility operating leases equipment line of credit king pharmaceuticals thrombin purchase total contractual cash obligations we do not have any other significant cash commitments related to supply agreements  nor do we have any significant commitments for capital expenditures 
we currently anticipate that we will experience positive cash flow from our normal operating activities 
we currently believe that our working capital of  at december   our recent one time receipt of million under the terms of the king license agreement signed in january and our anticipated cash from product sales will be sufficient to meet all of our operating and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  our actual liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  the amount of revenues from sales of our existing and new products  the cost of maintaining  enforcing and defending patents and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  developments related to regulatory and third party reimbursement matters  and other factors 
if cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our cash needs  we may be required to raise additional funds 
in the event that additional financing is needed  and depending on market conditions  we may seek to raise additional funds for working capital purposes through the sale of equity or debt securities 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations addresses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates and judgments 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we set forth below those material accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to an investor s understanding of our financial results and condition  and require complex management judgment 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the estimated value of excess  obsolete and slow moving inventory as well as inventory with a carrying value in excess of its net realizable value is established by us on a quarterly basis through review of inventory on hand and assessment of future demand  anticipated release of new products into the market  historical experience and product expiration 
our stated value of inventory could be materially different if demand for our products decreased because of competitive conditions or market acceptance  or if products become obsolete because of advancements in the industry 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as outlined in the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition  which requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed or determinable  iii collectibility is reasonably assured  and iv product delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
we recognize revenue as products are shipped based on fob shipping point terms when title passes to customers 
we negotiate credit terms on a customer by customer basis and products are shipped at an agreed upon price 
all product returns must be pre approved and  if approved  customers are subject to a restocking charge 
we analyze the rate of historical returns when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for sales returns  which is included with the allowance for doubtful accounts on our balance sheet 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be overstated 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance is regularly evaluated by us for adequacy by taking into consideration factors such as past experience  credit quality of the customer base  age of the receivable balances  both individually and in the aggregate  and current economic conditions that may affect a customer s ability to pay 
at december   this reserve was  compared to  at december  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty costs we provide a warranty for certain products against defects in material and workmanship for periods of up to months 
we record a liability for warranty claims at the time of sale 
the amount of the liability is based on the amount we are charged by our original equipment manufacturer to cover the warranty period 
the original equipment manufacturer includes a year warranty with each product sold to us 
we record a liability for the uncovered warranty period offered to a customer  provided the warranty period offered exceeds the initial one year warranty period covered by the original equipment manufacturer 
at december   this warranty provision was  compared to  at december  if the assumptions used in calculating the provision were to materially change  resulting in more defects than anticipated  an additional provision may be required 
income taxes the carrying value of our net deferred tax assets assumes that we will be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the united states and  to a lesser extent  germany  based on estimates and assumptions 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of our net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million valuation allowance related to our net deferred tax assets of million 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
on a quarterly basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and assess the requirement for a valuation allowance 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has issued statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  which requires companies to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based payments at fair value 
sfas r became effective for us on january  we recorded  of stock based compensation expense for the year ended december  see the stock based compensation discussion in note of our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivables 
we maintain our accounts for cash and cash equivalents principally at one major bank and one investment firm in the united states 
we have a formal written investment policy that restricts the placement of investments to issuers evaluated as creditworthy 
we have not experienced any losses on our deposits of our cash and cash equivalents 
with respect to accounts receivable  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and do not require collateral 
there have been no material losses on accounts receivables 
in the united states and germany  we sell our products directly to hospitals and clinics in the local currency 
in all other international markets  we sell our products to independent distributors who  in turn  sell to medical clinics 
we sell our product in these countries through independent distributors denominated in united states dollars 
loss  termination or ineffectiveness of distributors to effectively promote our product would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not believe our operations are currently subject to significant market risks for interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices or other relevant market price risks of a material nature 
we had  of indebtedness on our equipment line as of december  if we were to borrow additional amounts from our revolving credit line  we would be further exposed to changes in interest rates  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
advances under our revolving and equipment lines of credit bear interest at an annual rate indexed to prime 
we will thus be exposed to interest rate risk with respect to these lines of credit to the extent that interest rates rise when there are amounts outstanding under these lines of credit 
based on our debt outstanding at december   a increase in current market interest rates would have an impact of approximately  on an annual basis 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes
