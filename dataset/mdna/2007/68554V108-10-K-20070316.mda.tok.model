readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements contained herein and the notes thereto  along with the section entitled critical accounting policies and estimates  set forth below 
overview we operate primarily in the worldwide billion in vitro diagnostics business 
we develop  manufacture and market oral fluid specimen collection devices using proprietary oral fluid technologies  diagnostic products including immunoassays  and other in vitro diagnostic tests 
we also manufacture and sell medical devices for the removal of warts and other benign skin lesions by cryosurgery  or freezing 
our diagnostic product offerings primarily target the infectious disease and substance abuse testing segments of the larger in vitro diagnostic market  and are used in both laboratories as well as the emerging  and rapidly growing  point of care marketplace 
our orasure and intercept oral fluid collection devices  and their related assays  are processed in a laboratory  while the oraquick advance rapid hiv antibody test is designed for use at the point of care 
our cryosurgical products are also used at the point of care 
in vitro diagnostics have traditionally used blood or urine as the bodily fluids upon which tests are conducted 
however  we have targeted the use of oral fluid in our products as a differentiating factor and believe that it provides a significant competitive advantage over blood and urine 
our oral fluid tests have sensitivity and specificity comparable to blood and or urine tests 
when combined with their ease of use  non invasive and dignified nature  and cost effectiveness  our oral fluid tests represent a very competitive alternative to the more traditional testing methods in the diagnostic space 
during the year ended december   our total revenues were million  which represents a decrease from our net income for was million and includes a pre tax charge of million for stock options which are now required to be expensed under the new accounting rules 
our liquidity continued to improve  as we reported million in cash flow from operating activities in and a balance of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as of december  sales into the infectious disease testing market segment increased significantly in due to the continued market acceptance of our oraquick advance hiv test 
this increase resulted largely from sales directly to various public health organizations and sales through abbott into the hospital market 
these increases were offset by the absence of government bulk purchases by samhsa and the cdc 
in february  we entered into an agreement for the distribution of oraquick advance with abbott 
under this agreement  abbott was appointed as our exclusive distributor in the us hospital market and as a non exclusive distributor in the us physicians office marketplace 
as our exclusive distributor to hospitals  abbott sells oraquick advance to federal hospitals under the terms and conditions of our federal supply schedule that is on file with the us general services administration 
we have retained exclusive rights to all other markets  including the public health and criminal justice markets  the military  the cdc  samhsa and other government agencies 
we utilize a small internal sales force to support abbott and work together with them to maximize the penetration of oraquick advance in the hospital market 

table of contents competition in the market for hiv testing is intense and is expected to increase 
we believe that the principal competition will come from existing laboratory based blood tests  point of care rapid blood tests  laboratory based urine assays or other oral fluid based tests that may be developed 
our competitors include specialized biotechnology firms  as well as pharmaceutical companies with biotechnology divisions and medical diagnostic companies 
significant competitors for our oraquick advance rapid test  such as the ortho diagnostics division of johnson johnson  bio rad laboratories  abbott and bmx  sell laboratory based hiv eias  and maxim biomedical formerly calypte  inc sells an hiv screening test for urine  in the united states 
medmira and trinity biotech each sell competing rapid hiv blood tests  and bio rad laboratories and chembio sell competing rapid hiv blood tests in the united states 
these tests compete with our oraquick advance test in hospitals or other laboratory settings 
in addition  trinity biotech and chembio have received clia waivers for their rapid hiv tests and these tests compete with our oraquick advance test in the markets outside of the traditional hospital and laboratory settings 
these companies  or others  may continue to expand the bodily fluids with which a rapid hiv test may be performed  or develop and commercialize new rapid hiv tests  which would provide further competition for our oraquick advance test 
we believe other companies may also seek fda approval to sell competing rapid hiv tests in the future 
sales to the substance abuse testing market also increased during  reflecting the growing acceptance of our intercept collection device and related oral fluid drug assays  as both domestic and international corporate customers continued to adopt oral fluid based drug testing and shift away from traditional urine based drug testing 
we expect continued growth in the utilization of our intercept product line  primarily in the united states 
in april  samhsa published proposed guidelines that would  if adopted  include oral fluid testing as an accepted drug testing method for federal employees 
during the summer of  these proposed guidelines were withdrawn with no action taken and it is unclear when further action  if any  will be taken to permit the use of oral fluid as an accepted drug testing method in this market 
sales to the cryosurgical systems market declined during the cryosurgical systems market represents sales of histofreezer into both the domestic and international physicians office markets and sales of the otc formulation of this product to our domestic distributor  prestige  and our international distributor  ssl 
prestige distributes our cryosurgical wart removal product under its compound w freeze off tradenames in the otc market in the united states and canada 
ssl distributes a similar product under its scholl s and dr 
scholl trademarks in the otc footcare market in several european countries 
sales in the us otc cryosurgery marketplace declined primarily as a result of the disappointing performance by prestige 
sales to prestige for were million  or more than less than the million in sales recorded for in september  prestige announced that it had acquired the wartner cryosurgical wart removal product line  which directly competes with the freeze off product in the otc market 
our distribution agreement with prestige contains a covenant not to compete which precludes prestige from acquiring  manufacturing  distributing or selling a cryosurgical product that directly competes with the freeze off product 
we notified prestige that its acquisition of the wartner product constitutes a material breach of the distribution agreement and that certain of its other actions constitute additional breaches under the agreement 
we initiated the alternative dispute resolution procedures required under the agreement  which include mediation and binding arbitration 
the parties efforts to resolve this matter through mediation were not successful and an arbitration pursuant to the rules of the american arbitration association has been commenced  pursuant to the terms of the agreement 
we are evaluating alternative arrangements for distributing this product in the event a resolution with prestige cannot be reached 
as a result of this ongoing dispute  it is not possible to predict at this time the potential impact this matter may have on sales of freeze off in or beyond 
in july  we filed a lawsuit against schering plough for infringement of several of our patents relating to the technology for the cryosurgical removal ie  freezing of warts and other benign skin lesions 
the suit was 
table of contents commenced in the united states district court for the eastern district of pennsylvania and alleges that schering plough s manufacture and sale of its dr 
scholl s freeze away cryosurgical wart removal product in the otc market infringes three of our patents 
we are seeking injunctive relief and the payment of damages and schering plough has raised several defenses  including that their freeze away device does not infringe our patents and that one or more of our patents are either invalid or unenforceable 
on november   a pretrial conference was held in this matter  at which the court heard oral argument on motions for summary judgment filed by the parties 
these motions remain pending 
we expect a new trial schedule to be set after the court rules on these motions 
sales to the insurance risk assessment market continued to decline in  primarily because of a reduction in the number of applications for life insurance and changes in underwriting requirements 
for higher face value policies  it appears insurance companies are more likely to use a blood test for multiple risk factors  rather than an oral fluid test 
we currently expect that our revenues in this market will decline  or at best  remain at approximately the levels attained in because of the regulatory approvals needed for most of our products  we often are required to rely on sole source providers for critical components and materials and on related products supplied by third parties 
this is particularly true for our oraquick advance test  our orasure oral fluid collection device and our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory product 
if we are unable to obtain necessary components or materials from these sole sources  the time required to develop replacements and obtain the required fda approvals could disrupt our ability to sell the affected products 
bmx currently manufactures and sells the only oral fluid hiv screening test that has received fda approval for use in detecting hiv in an oral fluid specimen collected with our orasure collection device 
bmx also supplies the hiv antigen used to manufacture our oral fluid western blot hiv confirmatory test and is the exclusive world wide distributor of that product 
bmx recently notified us that they intend to discontinue manufacturing their hiv eia screening test during bmx also notified us that it has elected not to renew the western blot agreements beyond december  we are working closely with bmx  the fda and cdc  our main laboratory customers and other potential suppliers to find or develop an alternative hiv eia screening test and confirmatory test for use with our orasure collection device 
if our customers cannot obtain an hiv eia screening test or a confirmatory test that has been approved by the fda for use in connection with our orasure collection device  these customers would likely stop purchasing our orasure device and our revenues would be adversely affected 
we also rely heavily on distributors to purchase and resell many of our products 
for example  prestige has exclusive distribution rights to the freeze off product in the otc markets in united states and canada and ssl has exclusive rights to a similar product in the otc footcare market in europe  australia and new zealand 
similarly  abbott has exclusive rights to distribute our oraquick advance test to hospitals in the us we expect to enter into additional distribution agreements for new and future products  for distribution in the us and internationally 
if our distributors are unable or unwilling to meet the minimum purchase commitments set forth in their agreements or otherwise substantially reduce the volume of their purchases  our revenues and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we generated of our revenues in the us marketplace 
consequently  we are evaluating strategies to increase our sales penetration in markets outside the us as our business in foreign countries increases  we could be exposed to other economic  political  exchange rate  regulatory and cultural risks 
results of operations year ended december  compared to december  total revenues decreased by to million in from million in  primarily as a result of declines in domestic otc cryosurgical product revenues and insurance risk assessment revenues  partially 
table of contents offset by increased sales of our oraquick advance rapid hiv antibody test  our intercept oral fluid collection device and related drug assays  and our international cryosurgical products 
revenues derived from products sold in countries outside the us were million and million  or and of total revenues  for the years ended december  and  respectively

year ended december  dollars change percentage of total revenues market infectious disease testing substance abuse testing cryosurgical systems insurance risk assessment product revenues licensing and product development total revenues sales to the infectious disease testing market increased to million in  primarily as a result of higher sales of our oraquick hiv test in both the public health and hospital markets through our distributor  abbott

for the year ended december   sales to our hospital distributor  abbott  grew to million  as compared to million in this increase is a result of continued penetration of the hospital market by abbott 
abbott recently announced that it will sell part of its diagnostics business  including its rights to distribute oraquick advance  to general electric ge 
this transaction is expected to close during the first half of we intend to meet with executives from ge to discuss their plans for the oraquick advance product 
during  we shipped a total of million in oraquick advance hiv tests to the cdc and samhsa  as compared to million in we believe that federal  state and other governmental agencies 
table of contents may make future bulk purchases of oraquick advance for further distribution to the public health and other markets throughout the united states 
there is no assurance  however  that comparable size bulk purchase orders from these governmental entities or others will be received in the future 
likewise  any delay in receiving or deploying such bulk orders could adversely affect our financial performance 
we believe that our oraquick advance device  which is fda approved for detecting antibodies to both hiv and hiv in oral fluid  finger stick and venous whole blood  and plasma samples  and is clia waived for use with all sample types except plasma  provides a significant competitive advantage  thereby enabling us to fully implement a strategy for selling oraquick internationally 
we recently received notification that our oraquick advance product will be recommended to receive a ce mark  pending successful completion of a facility inspection 
ce marking will allow us to sell our product in europe 
our goal is to complete the facility inspection in the immediate future  secure a ce mark for oraquick advance  and then obtain several country specific registrations in order to permit the launch of this product in europe as soon as possible 
we are beginning to see evidence that sales of oraquick advance are negatively impacting sales of our orasure oral fluid collection device in the infectious disease testing market 
some customers who have purchased our orasure device for laboratory hiv testing in the past are now electing instead to purchase our oraquick advance test 
it is not possible at this time to estimate the extent of such change in purchasing patterns or the financial impact of replacing orasure sales with sales of our oraquick advance test 
sales to the substance abuse testing market increased to million in  as a result of increased sales of both our intercept oral fluid drug testing service and our qed rapid oral fluid alcohol test 
intercept sales increased as a result of continued growth for this product  especially in the workplace and international markets 
increased sales of our qed test are attributed to a change in government regulations  which increased demand for this product 
the table below shows a breakdown of our total intercept revenues in thousands  except generated in each market during and years ended december  change market workplace testing criminal justice international direct total intercept revenues we expect continued growth in intercept sales in as customers continue to shift from urine based to oral fluid based testing methods 
however  our microplate oral fluid drug assays  which are sold for use with the intercept collection device  are expected to come under increasing competitive pressure in the future from home brew assays developed internally by our laboratory customers 
in addition  our oral fluid microplate assays compete with urine based homogeneous assays that are run on fully automated  random access analyzers 
we believe our competitors are developing oral fluid tests suitable for use on these fully automated homogeneous assay systems and these assays  if and when they are developed and commercialized  could represent a significant competitive threat to our oral fluid microplate business 
in order to meet this competition  we recently signed a letter of intent to negotiate an agreement with roche diagnostics to jointly develop and commercialize fully automated homogeneous oral fluid drugs of abuse assays for use with our intercept device 
sales of our products in the cryosurgical systems market which includes both the physicians office and otc markets decreased to million in this decrease was primarily the result of lower sales of our domestic otc and professional cryosurgical products when compared to

our distribution agreement with prestige contains a covenant not to compete which precludes prestige from acquiring  manufacturing  distributing or selling a cryosurgical product that directly competes with the freeze off product 
we notified prestige that its acquisition of the wartner product constitutes a material breach of the distribution agreement and that certain of its other actions constitute additional breaches under the agreement

we are evaluating alternative arrangements for distributing this product in the event a resolution with prestige cannot be reached 
as a result of this ongoing dispute  it is not possible to predict at this time the potential impact this matter may have on sales of freeze off in or beyond 
in june  we entered into an agreement with ssl under which we manufacture and supply  and ssl distributes on an exclusive basis  the company s cryosurgical wart removal product in the otc footcare market in europe  australia and new zealand 
the product is manufactured and sold under ssl s scholl and dr 
scholl trademarks and initially was made available for retail purchase in pharmacies and other outlets in several european countries during the fourth quarter of sales to ssl under the distribution agreement were million and million in and  respectively 
ssl continues to build distribution networks in pharmacies and mass merchandisers throughout europe and expects to launch the otc product in additional countries during we expect revenues from ssl to increase significantly in during  we have agreed to co invest in ssl s marketing activities and will reimburse ssl for certain out of pocket costs of advertising and promoting this product in the international otc market 
we have also launched our otc cryosurgical wart removal product in mexico and intend to establish distributor relationships for similar products in otc markets in other latin american countries 
sales of our histofreezer product to physicians offices in the united states decreased to million in  as compared to million in sales of histofreezer in the international market increased to million in  as compared to million in we believe these changes were due to fluctuations in distributor ordering patterns and inventory levels during and  in the case of domestic histofreezer sales  increased competition 
we are beginning to see some evidence that sales of our otc cryosurgical products may reduce the number of individuals that will seek to obtain treatment of their warts by a physician  which in turn could negatively affect sales of our histofreezer product in the professional market 
however  it is not possible at this time to estimate the magnitude of the financial impact of this change

we currently expect that our revenues in this market will decline  or at best  remain at approximately the levels attained in licensing and product development revenues increased to  in  from  in licensing and product development revenues in both years were primarily related to our collaborative oral fluid research project with the university of pennsylvania and new york university  under a grant awarded by the national institutes of health 
this grant expired in june in january  the company entered into a collaboration agreement with schering plough corporation  for the development and promotion of a rapid oral fluid test for the detection of antibodies to the hepatitis c virus hcv 
as a result of this agreement  licensing and product development revenues are expected to increase to approximately million during quest and abbott accounted for and of total revenues for  respectively

research and development costs are expected to increase by approximately million in the vast majority of this expected increase is related to the clinical trial work associated with the development of our oraquick advance hiv otc test and our oraquick hcv test 
this amount also includes costs expected to be incurred for fda approval of new cryosurgical offerings  product registrations in foreign countries and development of fully automated homogeneous oral fluid drugs of abuse assays

we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in as we add sales personnel for the infectious disease market in order to drive oraquick advance sales in the public health  hospital and international markets 
during  we also expect to co invest in ssl s marketing activities and reimburse ssl for certain out of pocket costs of advertising and promoting our cryosurgical product in the international otc market 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to charges for stock based compensation expense  higher staffing costs and certain consulting costs related to implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system 
this increase was partially offset by a reduction in legal fees associated with delays in the schering plough litigation and a reduction in rent expense due to the purchase of two of our bethlehem  pa facilities in june general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in  as a result of increased legal expense related to both the prestige dispute and the schering plough patent infringement matter  as well as increased costs related to full year staffing levels 
interest expense increased to  in from  in  as a result of higher outstanding debt balances during the second half of the year  resulting from the financing for our purchase of two previously

interest income increased to million in from million in  as a result of higher yields on our investment portfolio and larger balances available for investment 
we purchase some of our cryosurgical products from  or utilize the services of  vendors located in the netherlands 
as a result of the decline in the exchange rate between the united states dollar and the euro  we recorded a  loss on foreign currency transactions for the year ended december   versus a  gain on foreign currency transactions recorded for the year ended december  during  we provided for income taxes at a rate equivalent to our estimated combined federal and state effective rates

during the first half of  we explored our options with respect to the uplink product  including transitioning the manufacturing of the product to our distribution partner  dr ger safety 
throughout this period  we were not able to reach an agreement with dr ger safety or determine an alternative outlet for this product 
in addition  we were advised that dr ger will no longer promote the sale of the uplink product 
as a result  we recorded a million charge in june to reflect a provision on inventory and fixed assets related to our uplink product

interest on outstanding borrowings under the revolving working capital line of credit accrues at a rate  selected at our option  equal to the bank s prime rate less  or day libor plus  determined at the time of initial borrowing 
on june   we executed an amendment to our credit facility  pursuant to which we are permitted to borrow up to an additional million in advances in order to fund the purchase and future expansion of two 
table of contents previously leased facilities in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
on june   we borrowed million under the terms of this credit facility  as amended  and purchased our two bethlehem facilities 
we can borrow the remaining million at any time before june  at our option  interest on outstanding borrowings is payable monthly at either a fixed rate equal to the five year us treasury note rate plus to  or a variable rate equal to the   or day libor rate plus to 
in each case  the interest rate is determined at the date of the advance and is based upon the amount of cash and cash equivalents we invest and retain at comerica securities  inc we can also choose the fixed rate option  without penalty  at the expiration of a previously elected libor period 
principal is repayable in periodic installments  based upon the rate option that we elect  with the remaining balance of unpaid principal due on june  this amendment also extended the maturity date of our million revolving working capital line of credit to june  all other terms of the credit facility  as previously amended  remain in effect  except for our financial covenant related to liquidity  which was modified to require a minimum liquidity  as defined by comerica  of not less than million  of which at least million must be held by comerica or its affiliates 
at december   interest on the new million borrowing was payable monthly  at the day libor rate plus  or 
principal is repayable in installments  due at the end of each libor rate period  based upon a twenty year amortization schedule and the number of months in the expiring libor rate period 
accordingly  on december   we will be required to make a  principal repayment and the interest rate on this loan will reset 
the outstanding balance of the loan at december  was million 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under the million term loan  the million non revolving line of credit  or the million revolving working capital line of credit 
all borrowings under the credit facility are collateralized by a first priority security interest in all of our assets  including present and future accounts receivable  chattel paper  contracts and contract rights  equipment and accessories  general intangibles  investments  instruments  inventories  and a mortgage on our three facilities in bethlehem  pennsylvania 
borrowings under the equipment and software non revolving line and the revolving working capital line are limited to commercially standard percentages of equipment and software purchases and accounts receivable  respectively 
the credit facility contains certain covenants that set forth minimum requirements for our quick ratio  liquidity and tangible net worth 
we were in full compliance with all covenants at december  and expect to remain in compliance with all covenants during the credit facility also restricts our ability to pay dividends  to make certain investments  to incur additional indebtedness  to sell or otherwise dispose of a substantial portion of assets and to merge or consolidate operations with an unaffiliated entity  without the consent of comerica 
at december   we had nol carryforwards of million for federal income tax purposes 
during the fourth quarter of  the company retained independent tax specialists to perform an ownership change study and analysis to determine the annual limitation amount applicable to utilization of the nol carryforwards due to past ownership changes  as defined in section of the internal revenue code 
as a result of this study  we do not believe that the ownership change limitations would impair our ability to use our nols against our current forecasted taxable income 
the combination of our current cash position  cash flow from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility is expected to be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to many factors  including  but not limited to  the scope and timing of strategic acquisitions  the cost and timing of the expansion of our manufacturing capacity  the progress of our research and development programs  the scope and results of clinical testing  the magnitude of capital expenditures  changes in existing and potential relationships with business partners  the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in obtaining and enforcing patents  proprietary rights and any necessary licenses  the cost and timing of expansion of sales and marketing activities  the timing of market launch of new products  market acceptance of new products  competing technological and market developments and other factors

critical accounting policies and estimates this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our judgments and estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  revenue recognition  restructuring costs  contingencies and litigation 
we base our judgments and estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the financial statements included in item of this annual report 
we consider the following accounting estimates  which have been discussed with our audit committee  to be most critical in understanding the more complex judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition 
we follow sab no 
 revenue recognition 
this bulletin draws on existing accounting rules and provides specific guidance on revenue recognition for up front non refundable licensing and development fees 
we license certain products or technology to outside third parties  in return for which we receive up front licensing fees 
some of these fees can be significant 
in accordance with sab no 
 we recognize this revenue ratably over the related license period 
we also enter into research and development contracts with corporate  government and or private entities 
these contracts generally provide for payments to us upon achievement of certain research or development milestones 
product development revenues from these contracts are recognized only if the specified milestone is achieved and accepted by the customer and payment from the customer is probable 
any amounts received prior to the performance of product development efforts are recorded as deferred revenues 
recognition of revenue under these contracts can be sporadic  as it is the result of achieving specific research and development milestones 
furthermore  revenue from future milestone payments will not be recognized if the underlying research and development milestone is not achieved 

table of contents we recognize product revenues when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title has passed and collection is reasonably assured 
product revenues are net of allowances for any discounts or rebates 
we do not grant price protection or product return rights to our customers  except for warranty returns 
where a product fails to comply with its limited warranty  we can either replace the product or provide the customer with a refund of the purchase price or credit against future purchases 
historically  returns arising from warranty issues have been infrequent and immaterial 
accordingly  we expense warranty returns as incurred 
while such returns have been immaterial in the past  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of warranty claims as we have in the past 
any significant increase in product warranty claims could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which the claims occur 
allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable 
accounts receivable are reduced by an estimated allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
on an ongoing basis  we perform credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon the customer s payment history and creditworthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
we also continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that are identified  we use our judgment to establish and evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for estimated credit losses  which was  at december  while credit losses have been within our expectations and the allowance provided  these losses can vary from period to period   and  in  and  respectively 
furthermore  there is no assurance that we will experience credit losses at the same rates as we have in the past 
also  at december   million  or of our accounts receivable  was due from four major customers 
any significant changes in the liquidity or financial position of these customers  or others  could have a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and future operating results 
inventories 
our inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market  determined on a first in  first out basis  and include the cost of raw materials  labor and overhead 
the majority of our inventories are subject to expiration dating 
we continually evaluate the carrying value of our inventories and when  in the opinion of management  factors indicate that impairment has occurred  either a reserve is established against the inventories carrying value or the inventories are completely written off 
we base these decisions on the level of inventories on hand in relation to our estimated forecast of product demand  production requirements over the next twelve months and the expiration dates of raw materials and finished goods 
during  and  we wrote off inventory which had a cost of  million and  respectively  as a result of scrap and product expiration issues and a million provision for loss on our uplink product in although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the carrying value of our inventories and reported operating results 
stock based compensation 
commencing january   we adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  which requires us to recognize the fair value of equity based awards as compensation expense in our statement of operations 
the fair value of our stock option awards was estimated using a black scholes option valuation model 
this valuation model incorporates highly subjective assumptions  such as the expected stock price volatility and the estimated life of each award  in the model s computations 
the fair value of awards  after considering the effect of expected forfeitures  is then amortized  generally on a straight line basis  over the related vesting period of the award 
long lived and intangible assets 
our long lived assets are comprised of property and equipment and an investment in a nonaffiliated entity  and our intangible assets primarily consist of patents and product rights 
together  these assets have a net book value of million  or of our total assets  at december  
table of contents our investment in a privately held nonaffiliated company is recorded under the cost method of accounting because we do not have a controlling interest in this company  nor do we have the ability to exert significant influence over the operating and financial policies of this investee company 
property and equipment  patents and product rights are depreciated or amortized on a straight line basis over their useful lives  which we determine based upon our estimate of the period of time over which each asset will generate revenues 
in august  we recorded a million intangible asset related to a payment under a license agreement to certain patents related to the hepatitis c virus 
we recorded an additional million related to this license in management s intent in executing this license is to provide for various alternatives for use  including uses in the international market that would not require additional research and development efforts or regulatory approvals 
this million asset was capitalized based on management s estimate of the cash flows to be received from future product sales in these international markets 
a similar analysis of estimated future cash flows will be prepared upon payment of additional license fees under this agreement  or upon changes in circumstances  to determine the appropriate accounting treatment for payments under this license agreement 
an impairment of long lived or intangible assets could occur whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the net book value of these assets may not be recoverable 
events which could trigger an asset impairment include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of an asset or in our overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  shortening of product life cycles or changes in technology  and negative financial performance of the nonaffiliated investee company 
if we believe impairment of an asset has occurred  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the net book value of the affected assets to the fair value of these assets  which is generally determined based upon the present value of the expected cash flows associated with the use of these assets 
if the net book value exceeds the fair value of the impaired assets  we would incur an impairment expense equal to this difference 
in june  we recorded a  provision for loss on our uplink fixed assets as a result of our inability to reach an agreement to transfer these assets to our distribution partner or determine an alternative outlet for these assets 
we currently believe the future cash flows to be received from all other long lived and intangible assets will exceed their book value and  as such  we have not recognized any additional impairment losses through december  any unanticipated significant impairment in the future  however  could have a material adverse impact to our balance sheet and future operating results 
deferred tax assets 
at december   we had federal nol carryforwards of million 
the net deferred tax asset associated with these nols and other temporary differences was million at december  in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
our ability to use our nol carryforwards to offset future federal income tax obligations  could be limited by changes in the ownership of our stock 
internal revenue code irc section contains provisions that limit the amount of federal nol carryforwards that can be used in any given year in the event of specified occurrences  including significant ownership changes 
in the fourth quarter of  the company completed an analysis  with the assistance of independent tax specialists  to determine if any irc section ownership changes have occurred that would limit the amount of nols that could be utilized to offset future taxable income 
as a result of this analysis  the company concluded that prior period ownership changes may impose a limitation on the amount of nols that can be utilized in a given year 
the company does not believe  however  that this limitation will impair our future ability to utilize nols to offset our forecasted taxable income or to realize the related deferred tax asset 
prior to december   a valuation allowance had been established for the full amount of the deferred tax asset created by these carryforwards and other items 
based on our results and our projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible or the nols and credit carryforwards can be utilized  we believe a significant portion of the deferred tax asset was realizable at 
table of contents december  as such  we recorded the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset at december  and have begun providing for income taxes at a rate equal to our combined federal and state effective rates 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
contingencies 
in the ordinary course of business  we have entered into various contractual relationships with strategic corporate partners  customers  distributors  research laboratories and universities  licensors  licensees  suppliers  vendors and other parties 
as such  we could be subject to litigation  claims or assessments arising from any or all of these relationships 
we account for contingencies such as these in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
requires us to record an estimated loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies arising from contractual or legal proceedings requires that we use our best judgment when estimating an accrual related to such contingencies 
as additional information becomes known  our accrual for a loss contingency could fluctuate  thereby creating variability in our results of operations from period to period 
likewise  an actual loss arising from a loss contingency which significantly exceeds the amount accrued for in our financial statements could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period in which such actual loss becomes known 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not hold any amounts of derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments and  accordingly  we have no material derivative risk to report under this item 
a significant portion of our assets is comprised of certificates of deposit  commercial paper  us government and agency obligations  and us corporate bonds 
all such instruments are classified as available for sale securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing the related income without significantly increasing risk 
even so  some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
market risk is the risk that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of an investment to fluctuate 
as interest rates increase  the fair value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
correspondingly  if interest rates decrease the fair value of a debt instrument would be expected to increase 
to minimize market risk  we have the ability to hold such debt instruments to maturity  at which time the debt instrument would be redeemed at its stated or face value 
we also typically invest in the shorter end of the maturity spectrum 
as such  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to market risk 
at december   approximately million of the company s long term debt bears interest at a variable or floating rate tied to either the united states prime rate or the london interbank offered rate 
a one percentage point increase in these interest rates would cost the company approximately  in additional interest expense 
as of december   we did not have any foreign currency exchange contracts or purchase currency options to hedge local currency cash flows 
we have operations in the netherlands  which are subject to foreign currency fluctuations 
as currency rates change  translation of revenues and expenses for these operations from euros to us dollars affects year to year comparability of operating results 
sales denominated in a foreign currency represented approximately  of our total revenues for the year ended december  we do not expect the risk of foreign currency fluctuations to be material in the near future
