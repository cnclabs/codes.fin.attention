item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
executive overview our business is organized into three segments small business services  financial services and direct checks 
our small business services segment generated of our consolidated revenue for this segment sells business checks  forms and related printed products to more than six million small businesses and home offices through financial institution referrals  direct response marketing  sales representatives  independent distributors and the internet 
small business services is comprised of new england business service  inc nebs  which we acquired in june  and our former business services segment 
our financial services segment generated of our consolidated revenue for this segment sells personal and business checks  check related products and services  and customer loyalty services to approximately  financial institution clients nationwide  including banks  credit unions and financial services companies 
our direct checks segment generated of our consolidated revenue for this segment is the nation s leading direct to consumer check supplier  selling under the checks unlimited and designer checks brands 
through these two brands  we sell personal and business checks and related products directly to consumers using direct response marketing and the internet 
all three of our segments operate primarily in the united states 
small business services also has operations in canada 
our results of operations for benefited from the following increased revenue per order and first time buyers for small business services as a result of our strategies to grow this business  a increase in order volume for financial services compared to  the first time order volume for this segment increased year over year since we began tracking orders as a measure of volume in synergies resulting from the nebs acquisition and various other cost reduction initiatives  lower amortization expense  a gain from the termination of an underperforming outsourced payroll services contract  and a lower tax rate due to a one time benefit related to a true up of deferred income taxes  as well as a lower overall state tax rate  contributing an increase of to diluted earnings per share 
these benefits were more than offset by a number of negative factors  including lower prices and an unfavorable shift in product mix for our financial services segment  lower order volume for direct checks due to previous reductions in advertising spending  lower consumer response and retention rates and the continuing decline in check usage  a non cash asset impairment loss of million recorded in the second quarter of  resulting from the abandonment of a software project  investments to execute our small business services strategies  and net severance charges of million 
our strategies small business services our focus within small business services is to grow revenue and increase operating margin by continuing to implement the following strategies consolidate brands and leverage cross selling opportunities  increase our share of the amount small businesses spend on the products and services in our portfolio  and further leverage customer referrals that we receive from our financial institution clients 
we are consolidating our various brands  as well as developing a new sales model to integrate field sales  marketing and customer call centers across the company 
we believe this will create more focus on customers  position us for growth and ensure we are leveraging processes  facilities and resources to our best advantage 
we have also identified opportunities to expand sales to our existing customers 
we believe that there is a significant opportunity to increase our share of the total dollars spent by our average small business customer on products and services in our portfolio 
additionally  the small business customer referrals we receive from our financial institution clients will continue to be an important part of our growth strategies 
we continue to see growth from our deluxe business advantage sm program  which provides a fast and simple way for financial institutions to offer expanded personalized service to small businesses 
in october  we completed the acquisition of the assets of johnson group and its affiliated companies  which provides prepress  printing  mailing and fulfillment  and finishing services 
while the acquisition did not have a significant impact on earnings or operating cash flow in  it allows us to expand our business in the custom  full color  digital and web to print space with our small business customers 
it also provides potential opportunities longer term  specifically in the area of literature management  for financial institutions 
further information regarding this acquisition can be found under the caption note acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we have also taken steps to divest non strategic product lines 
during the fourth quarter of  we terminated an outsourced payroll services contract and in january  we completed the sale of our industrial packaging product line for million  realizing a gain of approximately million 
this business generated approximately million of revenue in we do not expect this sale to have a significant impact on earnings or operating cash flow 
financial services our strategies within financial services are as follows continue to retain core check revenue  acquire new customers and simplify our business model  and provide services and products that differentiate us from the competition and make us a more relevant business partner to our financial institution clients 
we have recently introduced and continue to pilot several new services for our financial institution clients focused on new customer acquisition and customer loyalty 
one example is the welcome home sm tool kit  a package for financial institution branch offices which enables them to forge strong bonds with new customers  thereby increasing customer loyalty and retention 
another example is deluxe loyalty sm measurement services  which provides research at key customer touchpoints 
the research is made available to our clients to help them target their strategies and resources where they will be most effective 
we also continue to offer deluxe id theftblock  a set of monitoring and recovery services that provides help to consumers in detecting and recovering from identity theft  as well as our knowledge exchange tm series  a suite of resources and events for our financial institution clients focused on the customer experience 
we recently announced the launch of deluxecalling sm  a consumer calling service providing a first point of contact with new indirect loan consumers on behalf of our financial institution clients 
providing products and services that differentiate us from the competition is expected to help offset the declining revenue in this segment 
as such  we are also focused on accelerating the pace at which we introduce new products and services 
in addition to our initiatives to retain customers and introduce new products and services  we will continue our efforts to simplify processes and eliminate complexity in this business 
our efforts are focused on streamlining call center and check fulfillment activities  redesigning services into standardized flexible models  eliminating multiple systems and work streams  and strengthening go to market capabilities and processes using lean principles 
direct checks our focus within direct checks is to re capture a larger portion of the direct to consumer channel by continuing to implement the following strategies modestly increase our marketing spend to recapture direct channel share  acquire and retain customers  and maximize the lifetime value of customers by selling new features and accessories 
we have introduced a new product within direct checks that has been well received by consumers 
the new product  called ezshield tm  is a fraud protection service which provides reimbursement to consumers for forged signatures or endorsements and altered checks 
we are also developing improved call center processes to provide additional products to direct checks small business customers  and we continue to explore other avenues to increase sales to existing customers 
additionally  during the third quarter of  we entered into a new direct mail advertising contract which significantly increases our advertising circulation of free standing inserts for at least the next several years beginning in the first quarter of this has been an effective form of new customer acquisition in this channel 
cost reduction initiatives we are pursuing aggressive cost reduction and business simplification initiatives  including reducing shared services infrastructure costs  streamlining our call center and check fulfillment activities  eliminating system and work stream redundancies  and strengthening our go to market capabilities through the continuing application of lean principles 
we believe significant cost reduction opportunities exist in the reduction of skus  the standardization of products and services and improvements in sourcing third party goods and services 
these opportunities collectively are expected to reduce our annual cost structure by at least million  net of required investments  by the end of the baseline for these anticipated savings is the annual diluted earnings per share guidance for of to  which we provided in our press release on july  regarding second quarter results 
we expect all three of our business segments to benefit from cost reductions 
we estimate that approximately of the million target will come from our shared services infrastructure organizations 
we expect information technology will provide the greatest percentage of these savings through lowering data center costs  improving mainframe and server utilization and reducing the cost of networking and voice communications 
we estimate that approximately of the million target will come from fulfillment  including manufacturing and supply chain  and we estimate that approximately of the million target will come from reorganizing our sales and marketing functions 
overall  one third of the savings are expected to affect cost of goods sold  with the remaining two thirds impacting selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
we estimate that we realized approximately of our million target in business challenges the market for our two largest products  checks and business forms  is very competitive 
these products are mature and their use has been declining 
according to our estimates  the total number of checks written in the united states has been in decline as a result of alternative payment methods  including credit cards  debit cards  automated teller machines and electronic payment systems 
a federal reserve study reported that the check accounted for approximately of all non cash payments processed in  down from in the federal reserve study also indicated that the use of personal checks is declining faster than the use of business checks 
we estimate that personal check usage is declining between four to five percent per year and that small business check usage is declining approximately two to three percent per year 
updated information will be available in when the federal reserve is expected to publish the results of its next study 
in addition to the decline in check usage  the use of business forms is also under pressure 
continual technological improvements have provided small business customers with alternative means to enact and record business transactions 
for example  off the shelf business software applications and electronic transaction systems have been designed to automate several of the functions performed by business forms products 
because check usage is declining and financial institutions are consolidating  we have been encountering significant pricing pressure when negotiating contracts with our financial institution clients 
our traditional financial institution relationships are typically formalized through supply contracts averaging three to five years in duration 
as we compete to retain and acquire new financial institution business  the resulting pricing pressure  combined with declining check usage in the marketplace  has reduced our revenue and profit margins 
we expect this trend to continue 
our direct checks segment and portions of our small business services segment have been impacted by reduced customer response rates to direct mail advertisements 
our own experience indicates that direct to consumer media response rates are declining across a wide variety of products and services 
additionally  our customer response rates are declining further due to the decline in check usage and the gradual obsolescence of standardized forms products 
outlook for we anticipate that consolidated revenue will be between billion and billion for  as compared to billion for as discussed earlier under our strategies  in january  we completed the sale of our small business services industrial packaging product line which generated approximately million of revenue for excluding the impact of the divestiture  we expect mid single digit revenue growth for small business services will be offset by continuing pricing pressure within financial services and volume pressure at direct checks 
however  based on the actions outlined earlier under our strategies  we anticipate that the revenue declines for our personal check businesses will decrease to single digit rates 
we expect that diluted earnings per share will be between and  compared to for we expect that operating income will increase from due to our cost reduction initiatives  partially offset by the impact of revenue declines in our personal check businesses  higher performance based employee compensation and other cost increases 
also  our results for included a non cash asset impairment loss of million 
we estimate that our effective tax rate for will be to  as compared to for we anticipate that operating cash flow will be between million and million in  down slightly from million in while we expect a positive impact from working capital improvements in  this impact will not completely offset the million benefit realized in from a decision to lower the level at which we pre fund our voluntary employee beneficiary association veba trust  which is used to pay medical and severance benefits 
we do not expect the sale of our industrial packaging product line to have a significant impact on operating cash flow 
we expect capital spending to be approximately million in as we invest in the following key initiatives manufacturing projects to add capabilities  increase synergies and drive cost reductions  investments in tools  processes and systems to accelerate business simplification  reduce our cost structure and better serve our customers  and other projects to drive non check revenue generating programs 
we will also continue to focus on reducing our debt and improving our financial ratios 
consolidated results of operations consolidated revenue percent change in thousands  except per order amounts vs

revenue orders revenue per order the decrease in revenue for  as compared to  was due to lower prices and a change in product mix in our financial services segment resulting in significantly lower revenue per order  a decline in volume for our direct checks segment and million of contract termination payments in the second quarter of lower volume for direct checks was due to the overall decline in check usage  as well as lower customer retention  lower direct mail consumer response rates and lower advertising expenditures in prior periods 
partially offsetting these decreases was increased revenue for small business services due to higher revenue per order and an increase in first time buyers as we continued to implement the growth strategies discussed earlier under executive overview 
additionally  direct checks revenue per order increased  as did financial services order volume 
revenue per order increased for direct checks due to the introduction of the ezshield product discussed under executive overview  as well as a decline in orders received through our mail channel  which typically result in lower revenue per order 
financial services volume increased as the impact of net client gains exceeded the impact of the decline in check usage

revenue per order decreased for  as compared to  as lower prices and a change in product mix in financial services more than offset the impact of the increases in revenue per order for small business services and direct checks 
the increase in revenue for  as compared to  was due to the full year impact of the nebs acquisition in june  which contributed an increase in revenue of million for the million decrease in revenue for our other businesses compared to was primarily due to a decline in volume for our financial services and direct checks segments 
the loss of a large financial institution client in late was the largest single contributor to the volume decline 
in addition  the volume decrease was due to the overall decline in check usage  mid client losses due to financial institution consolidations and the following factors specific to our direct checks segment lower direct mail consumer response rates  lower customer retention and an increase in financial institutions offering free checks to consumers 
revenue was also negatively affected by continued pricing pressure in our financial services segment 
partially offsetting these decreases was increased revenue per order for our direct checks segment due to a shift from the mail order channel to the internet and phone order channels  which typically result in higher revenue per order and a higher percentage of reorders 
additionally  direct checks reorders  which generate higher revenue per order  became a larger percentage of total orders  and we benefited from price increases in our small business services segment 
contract termination payments did not have a significant impact on our revenue  as compared to  as the amount of these payments was comparable each year

gross margin decreased for  as compared to  primarily due to lower prices and an unfavorable shift in product mix in financial services  contract termination payments received in and higher overall product delivery costs in due to rate increases and fuel surcharges 
partially offsetting these declines was the increase in small business services revenue per order discussed earlier  as well as cost savings from closing two small business services manufacturing facilities in mid gross margin decreased for  as compared to  due in large part to the full year impact of nebs operations 
nebs historical gross margins were seven to eight points lower than our other businesses because of its non check product mix 
this resulted in a percentage point decrease in our consolidated gross margin in additionally  pricing pressure in our financial services segment continued to impact our gross margin 
partially offsetting these decreases was the increase in direct checks revenue per order discussed earlier  on going cost management efforts  including the closing of six printing facilities in  continued productivity improvements  as well as cost synergies resulting from the nebs acquisition and lower performance based employee compensation

partially offsetting these decreases were investments related to our small business services growth strategies  primarily the hiring and training of call center and sales personnel  higher customer care costs and commissions for small business services as a result of the increased revenue and severance charges of million related to executing our cost savings initiatives 
further information regarding the severance charges can be found under restructuring accruals

additionally  nebs results increased our sg a percentage by percentage points 
nebs historically had a higher sg a percentage than our other businesses due to its greater reliance on direct mail and a direct sales force to acquire and retain customers  as well as its decentralized sg a functions 
as previously discussed  these results included an increase of million in acquisition related amortization expense and an increase of million in integration expenses

partially offsetting these reductions in our tax rate were accruals for contingent tax liabilities 
accruals related to unresolved tax contingencies more than offset net accrual reversals of million related to settled issues  primarily resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations in various state income tax jurisdictions 
the overall decrease in our effective tax rate contributed to diluted earnings per share for  as compared to we expect that our annual effective tax rate for will be approximately to 
the decrease in our effective tax rate for  as compared to  was primarily due to the new federal qualified production activity deduction which was passed as part of the american jobs creation act of  as well as changes in our state tax rates due to changes in our legal entity structure

restructuring accruals during  we recorded restructuring accruals of million for employee severance related to employee reductions within our shared services functions of sales  marketing  customer care  fulfillment  information technology  human resources and finance  as well as the closing of our financial services customer service call center located in syracuse  new york 
the syracuse facility was closed in january and the other employee reductions are expected to be completed by mid these reductions were the result of the cost reduction initiatives discussed earlier under executive overview 
the restructuring accruals included severance payments for employees  which we expect to fully pay by the end of utilizing cash from operations 
also during  we reversed million of previously recorded restructuring accruals 
these restructuring charges  net of the reversals  are reflected as cost of goods sold of million and sg a expense of million in our consolidated statement of income 
as a result of these initiatives  we expect to realize annual cost savings of approximately million in cost of goods sold and million in sg a expense in  in comparison to our results of operations 
reduced costs consist primarily of labor costs 
in conjunction with the acquisition of nebs  we recorded million of restructuring accruals in related to nebs activities which we decided to exit

the severance accruals included payments due to employees 
this included employees in the tucker  georgia printing facility  which was closed during the fourth quarter of  and the los angeles  california and athens  ohio facilities  which were closed in the second quarter of additionally  the accruals included employees in various functional areas throughout nebs resulting from our shared services approach to manufacturing and certain sg a functions 
the severance accruals also included amounts due to certain nebs executives under change of control provisions included in their employment agreements  as we eliminated redundancies between the two companies 
as a result of these facility closings and other employee reductions  we estimate that we realized savings of approximately million in cost of goods sold and million in sg a expense in  in comparison to our results of operations 
because two of the facilities were closed in mid  we anticipate additional savings in of approximately million in cost of goods sold  in comparison to our results of operations 
during  we recorded restructuring accruals of million for employee severance primarily related to the closing of our financial services check printing facility located in dallas  texas and our direct checks check printing facility located in anniston  alabama  as well as reductions in various functional areas primarily within our direct checks and financial services segments 
the closure of the dallas facility was primarily due to the loss of a major financial institution client whose contract expired at the end of the other reductions were a result of the continuing decline in check usage  as well as increased productivity 
both the dallas and anniston facilities were closed during the fourth quarter of the other employee reductions were completed during in total  employees received a total of million in severance payments  which were funded by cash from operations

as that maturity approaches  we have been refining cash flow projections  while meeting with capital market advisors to understand market conditions and to further develop our strategy to repay this obligation 
there are multiple financing options available to us  including  but not limited to  the bank market  our credit facilities or additional long term debt 
we currently have million available under our credit facilities 
cash generated by operating activities in will also be a factor in our decision 
we anticipate that operating cash flow will be between million and million in  down slightly from million in while we expect a positive impact from working capital improvements in  this impact will not completely offset the million benefit realized in from the change in our veba funding method 
additionally  in the third quarter of  we reduced our quarterly dividend amount by to per share 
this is providing additional cash which may be used for debt service 
we reduced our debt by million during  and we expect to reduce our debt by a total of million to million by the end of we believe future cash flows provided by operating activities and our available credit capacity are sufficient to support our operations  including capital expenditures  required debt service and dividend payments  for the foreseeable future 
capital resources our total debt was  million as of december   a decrease of million from december  capital structure december  in thousands change amounts drawn on credit facilities commercial paper current portion of long term debt long term debt total debt shareholders deficit total capital we are in a shareholders deficit position due to the required accounting treatment for share repurchases  completed primarily in and we have an outstanding authorization from our board of directors to purchase up to million shares of our common stock 
this authorization has no expiration date  and million shares remain available for purchase under this authorization 
we have not repurchased any shares since the second quarter of  and we do not expect to repurchase a significant number of additional shares in the near future  as we intend to focus on reducing our outstanding debt 
in addition to the impact of share repurchases  we are in a shareholders deficit position due to the adoption on december  of the recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the impact of this accounting standard is discussed in detail under other changes in financial condition 
the adoption of this standard increased shareholders deficit million as of december  further information regarding changes in shareholders deficit can be found in the consolidated statements of shareholders deficit appearing in item of this report

we may  from time to time  consider retiring outstanding debt through cash purchases  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
any such repurchases or exchanges  if any  would depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
at this time we do not anticipate retiring outstanding debt  other than the notes maturing in october which do not allow settlement prior to their stated maturity 
we do not believe that settling our other long term notes is the best use of our financial resources at this time 
during  we entered into million of forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge  or lock in  the interest rate on a portion of the debt we issued in the termination of the lock agreements in september yielded a deferred pre tax loss of million 
during  we entered into two forward rate lock agreements to effectively hedge  or lock in  the annual interest rate on a portion of the debt we issued in the termination of the lock agreements in december yielded a deferred pre tax loss of million 
these losses are reflected  net of tax  in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheets and are being amortized ratably to our statements of income as increases to interest expense over the terms of the related debt 
during and  million was amortized and included in interest expense 
we currently have a million commercial paper program in place which is supported by two committed lines of credit 
given our current credit ratings  the commercial paper market is not available to us 
as necessary  we utilize our million committed lines of credit to meet our working capital requirements 
the credit agreements governing the lines of credit contain customary covenants requiring a ratio of earnings before interest and taxes to interest expense of times  as well as limits on levels of subsidiary indebtedness 
we were in compliance with all debt covenants as of december   and we expect to remain in compliance with all debt covenants throughout the next year 
as of december   amounts were available under our committed lines of credit for borrowing or for support of commercial paper  as follows in thousands total available expiration date commitment fee five year line of credit july five year line of credit july total committed lines of credit amounts drawn on credit facilities outstanding letters of credit net available for borrowing as of december  in october  standard and poor s credit rating agency s p lowered our long term debt rating from bb to bb with a negative outlook 
our s p short term credit rating remains at b 
s p indicated that the downgrade reflects an increase in expected operating challenges 
in august  moody s investors service moody s lowered our long term debt rating from baa to ba  lowered our short term debt rating from prime to not prime and assigned a ba corporate family rating with a negative outlook 
moody s indicated that the downgrades reflect a lower revenue base and lower operating margins 
our credit facilities do not have covenants or events of default tied to our credit ratings 
other changes in financial condition other current assets decreased million from december  this was primarily due to a reduction in the prepayment related to the veba trust we use to fund medical and severance benefits 
historically  we made the majority of our contributions to this trust in the first quarter of the year and would fund our obligations from the trust assets throughout the year  leaving a prepaid balance in the trust at the end of the year 
during  we decided to change this practice 
we now fund the veba obligations throughout the year because the tax benefit from pre funding the trust no longer exceeds the interest cost associated with the pre funding 
during we contributed a total of million to the veba trust  consisting of company contributions of million and employee contributions of million 
during we contributed a total of million to the trust  consisting of company contributions of million and million of employee contributions 
as of december   our liability for incurred but not reported medical claims exceeded the prepaid balance in the veba trust by million 
as such  as of december   no amount was reported in other current assets for the veba trust and the million liability was included in accrued liabilities 
the excess of assets in our veba trust over the amount of incurred but not reported claims was million as of december  this amount was reflected in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet as of december  other non current assets include contract acquisition costs of our financial services segment 
these costs are recorded as non current assets upon contract execution and are amortized  generally on the straight line basis  as reductions of revenue over the related contract term 
changes in contract acquisition costs for the last three years were as follows in thousands balance  beginning of year additions amortization refunds from contract terminations balance  end of year contract acquisition costs are accrued upon contract execution 
cash payments made for contract acquisition costs were  in   in and  in the number of checks being written has been in decline since the mid s  which has contributed to increased competitive pressure when attempting to retain or obtain clients 
both the number of financial institution clients requesting contract acquisition payments and the amount of the payments has increased in recent years  and has fluctuated significantly from year to year 
although we anticipate that we will selectively continue to make contract acquisition payments  we cannot quantify future amounts with certainty 
the amount paid depends on numerous factors such as the number and timing of contract executions and renewals  competitors actions  overall product discount levels and the structure of up front product discount payments versus providing higher discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
when the overall discount level provided for in a contract is unchanged  contract acquisition costs do not result in lower net revenue 
the impact of these costs is the timing of cash flows 
an up front cash payment is made as opposed to providing higher product discount levels throughout the term of the contract 
beginning in  we sought to reduce the use of up front product discounts by structuring new contracts with incentives throughout the duration of the contract 
we plan to continue this strategy in liabilities for contract acquisition payments are recorded upon contract execution 
these obligations are monitored for each contract and are adjusted as payments are made 
contract acquisition payments due within the next year are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
these accruals were million as of december  and million as of december  accruals for contract acquisition payments included in other non current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets were million as of december  and million as of december  on december   we adopted the recognition provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the new standard requires companies to recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an asset or liability on the balance sheet and to recognize changes in that funded status in the year in which the change occurs through comprehensive income 
the adjustments required to reflect the funded status of our postretirement medical benefit and pension plans as of december  were as follows in thousands before application of sfas no 
adjustments after application of sfas no 
deferred income taxes other non current assets total assets accrued liabilities deferred income taxes other non current liabilities total liabilities accumulated other comprehensive loss total shareholders deficit off balance sheet arrangements  guarantees and contractual obligations it is not our general business practice to enter into off balance sheet arrangements nor to guarantee the performance of third parties 
in the normal course of business we periodically enter into agreements that incorporate general indemnification language 
these indemnifications encompass such items as product or service defects  intellectual property rights  governmental regulations and or employment related matters 
performance under these indemnities would generally be triggered by our breach of the terms of the contract 
in disposing of assets or businesses  we often provide representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks including  for example  unknown damage to the assets  environmental risks involved in the sale of real estate  liability to investigate and remediate environmental contamination at waste disposal sites and manufacturing facilities  and unidentified tax liabilities and legal fees related to periods prior to disposition 
we do not have the ability to estimate the potential liability from such indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  we have no reason to believe that any potential liability under these indemnities would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  annual results of operations or cash flows 
we have recorded liabilities for known indemnifications related to environmental matters 
further information can be found under the caption note other commitments and contingencies of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
we are not engaged in any transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other third parties that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our liquidity  or on our access to  or requirements for capital resources 
in addition  we have not established any special purpose entities 
as of december   our contractual obligations were as follows in thousands total and and and thereafter long term debt and related interest amounts drawn on credit facilities capital lease obligations and related interest operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total purchase obligations include amounts due under contracts with third party service providers 
these contracts are primarily for information technology services related to network servers  personal computers  telecommunications and help desk services 
additionally  purchase obligations include amounts due under direct checks direct mail advertising agreements and direct checks and financial services royalty agreements 
we routinely issue purchase orders to numerous vendors for the purchase of inventory and other supplies 
these purchase orders are not included in the purchase obligations presented here  as our business partners typically allow us to cancel these purchase orders as necessary to accommodate business needs 
certain of the contracts with third party service providers allow for early termination upon the payment of early termination fees 
if we were to terminate these agreements  we would have incurred early termination fees of million as of december  other long term liabilities consist primarily of amounts due for our postretirement benefit plans  deferred compensation  workers compensation and contract acquisition costs 
of the million reported as other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of december   million is excluded from the obligations shown in the table above 
the excluded amounts include the following benefit payments for our postretirement benefit plans we have contributed funds to these plans for the purpose of funding our obligations 
thus  we have the option of paying benefits from the assets of the plans or from the general funds of the company 
additionally  we expect the plan assets to earn income over time 
as such  we cannot predict when or if payments from the general funds of the company will be required 
as of december   our postretirement benefit plans were underfunded million 
a portion of the amount due under our deferred compensation plan under this plan  employees begin receiving payments upon the termination of employment or disability  and we cannot predict when these events will occur 
environmental remediation costs during  we purchased an environmental insurance policy which covers pre existing conditions from third party claims and cost overruns for years at owned  leased and divested sites  as well as any new conditions discovered at currently owned or leased sites for ten years 
as a result  we expect to receive reimbursements from the insurance company for environmental remediation costs we incur 
the related receivables from the insurance company are reflected in other current assets and other non current assets in our consolidated balance sheets based on the amounts of our environmental accruals 
items which will not be paid in cash  such as a deferred gain resulting from a sale leaseback transaction with an unaffiliated third party 
total contractual obligations do not include the following payments to our defined contribution pension and k plans the amounts payable under our defined contribution pension and k plans are dependent on the number of employees providing services throughout the year  their wage rates and in the case of the k plans  whether employees elect to participate in the plans 
profit sharing and cash bonus payments amounts payable under our profit sharing and cash bonus plans are dependent on our operating performance 
income tax payments which will be remitted on our earnings 
related party transactions we have not entered into any material related party transactions during the past three years 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies used in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the result of which forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
the estimates and judgments utilized are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis and by the audit committee of our board of directors at the end of each quarter prior to the public release of our financial results 
we made no changes to our critical accounting policies during application of critical accounting policies goodwill and indefinite lived trade names as of december   we had goodwill of million  comprised of million from the acquisition of nebs  million related to our direct checks segment  million related to our acquisition of johnson group in the fourth quarter of and million related to our acquisition of dots pixels  inc  a canadian based digital printer  in the third quarter of further information regarding our acquisitions can be found under the caption note acquisitions of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
goodwill is tested for impairment on at least an annual basis and between annual evaluations if events or circumstances occur which could indicate impairment 
as discussed earlier under segment results  our direct checks segment has been impacted by the decline in check usage  lower consumer response rates to direct mail advertisements  lower customer retention and an increase in financial institutions offering free checks to consumers 
to date  we have been able to offset to a large degree the impact of the resulting volume decline through improved selling techniques  price increases and cost management efforts 
the impairment analysis completed during the third quarter of indicated no impairment of goodwill 
we also have two indefinite lived trade names totaling million as of december   related to the nebs acquisition 
we continually evaluate the remaining useful lives of these assets to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
if we subsequently determine that one or both of these assets has a finite useful life  we will first test the asset for impairment and then amortize the asset over its estimated remaining useful life 
indefinite lived trade names are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis and between annual evaluations if events or circumstances occur which could indicate that the asset is impaired 
the annual impairment analysis completed during the third quarter of found no indication of impairment 
however  the valuation determined that the fair value of one of the indefinite lived trade names approximated its carrying value  with a fair value of million and a carrying value of million 
in determining the fair value of this asset  we assumed a discount rate of and a royalty rate of 
a one percentage point increase in the discount rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by million and a one percentage point decrease in the royalty rate would reduce the indicated fair value of the asset by million 
an impairment loss may be required if future events cause a decrease in the indicated fair value of these assets 
the evaluation of asset impairment requires us to make assumptions about future cash flows over the life of the asset being evaluated 
these assumptions require significant judgment and actual results may differ from assumed or estimated amounts 
if these estimates and assumptions change  we may be required to recognize impairment losses in the future 
income taxes when preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax obligations based on expected income  statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
in the event there is a significant unusual or one time item recognized in our results of operations  the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the period the unusual or one time item occurred 
tax law requires certain items to be included in our tax return at different times than the items are reflected in our results of operations 
as a result  the annual effective tax rate reflected in our results of operations is different than that reported on our tax return ie  our cash tax rate 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some are temporary differences that will reverse over time  such as depreciation expense on capital assets 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheets 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in our tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the expense in our statements of income 
we must assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance against those deferred tax assets 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent items for which we have already taken a deduction in our tax return  but we have not yet recognized the items as expense in our results of operations 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax positions  and in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we establish reserves when  despite our belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged and we may ultimately not prevail in defending those positions 
we adjust these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the closing of a tax audit 
our effective tax rate includes the impact of reserve provisions and changes to reserves  as well as related interest 
our reserves for contingent tax liabilities totaled million as of december   and are included in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet 
these reserves relate to various tax years subject to audit by taxing authorities 
we believe that our current tax reserves are adequate  and reflect the most probable outcome of known tax contingencies 
the ultimate outcome of tax matters may differ from our estimates and assumptions and could impact the provision for income taxes reflected in our consolidated statements of income 
unfavorable settlement of any particular issue would require the use of cash 
favorable resolution could result in reduced income tax expense in our consolidated statements of income in the future 
during  we reduced our provision for income taxes million for net accrual reversals related to settled issues  primarily resulting from the expiration of the statute of limitations in various state income tax jurisdictions 
also during  we reduced our provision for income taxes million for the true up of certain deferred income tax balances 
as this item was not material to our current or prior periods  we recorded a one time  discrete benefit to our provision for income taxes for the year ended december  no significant adjustments to our provision for income taxes related to reserves for contingent tax liabilities or deferred income taxes were recorded during or our accounting for income taxes in will be affected by the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which we are required to adopt on january  the new standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
as such  the new standard requires us to reassess all of our uncertain tax return positions in accordance with this new accounting principle 
further details regarding the impact of the adoption of fin no 
can be found under new accounting pronouncements 
postretirement benefits detailed information regarding our postretirement benefit plans  including a description of the plans  their related future cash flows and plan assets  can be found under the caption note pension and other postretirement benefits of the notes to consolidated financial statements appearing in item of this report 
our net postretirement benefit expense was million for and and million for our business segments record postretirement benefit expense in cost of goods sold and sg a expense  based on the composition of their workforces 
our postretirement benefit expense and liability are calculated utilizing various actuarial assumptions and methodologies 
these assumptions include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the expected health care cost trend rate and the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants 
the discount rate assumption is based on the rates of return on high quality  fixed income instruments currently available whose cash flows match the timing and amount of expected benefit payments 
in determining the discount rate  we utilize yield curve approaches to discount each cash flow stream at an interest rate specifically applicable to the timing of each respective cash flow 
the present value of each cash flow stream is aggregated and used to impute a weighted average discount rate 
additionally  we consider moody s high quality corporate bond rates when selecting our discount rate 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the health care cost trend rate are based upon an evaluation of our historical trends and experience  taking into account current and expected market conditions 
the long term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for expected benefit payments 
the health care cost trend rate represents the expected annual rate of change in the cost of health care benefits currently provided due to factors other than changes in the demographics of plan participants 
to determine the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants  we use the rp combined healthy participant mortality table 
we analyze the assumptions used each year when we complete our actuarial valuation of the plan 
if the assumptions utilized in determining our postretirement benefit expense and liability differ from actual events  our results of operations for future periods could be impacted 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   we assumed a discount rate of 
a point change in the discount rate would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million and would increase or decrease our postretirement benefit obligation by approximately million 
in measuring the net postretirement benefit expense for  we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of 
a point change in this assumption would increase or decrease our annual postretirement benefit expense by approximately million 
in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of december   our initial health care inflation rate for was assumed to be for participants under the age of and for participants over the age of our ultimate health care inflation rate was assumed to be in and beyond for participants under the age of and in and beyond for participants over the age of a one percentage point increase in the health care inflation rate for each year would increase the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual postretirement benefit expense by million 
a one percentage point decrease in the health care inflation rate for each year would decrease the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by million and the service and interest cost components of our annual postretirement benefit expense by million 
when actual events differ from our assumptions or when we change the assumptions used  an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss results 
unrecognized gains and losses are reflected in postretirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of plan participants  which is currently years 
because employees hired after december  are not eligible to participate in our retiree health care plan  the average remaining service period of active plan participants will continue to decrease 
as such  the amortization of our unrecognized actuarial loss will accelerate over the next several years 
we expect that amortization of the unrecognized actuarial loss will increase approximately million in  as compared to as of december  and  our unrecognized net actuarial loss was million and million  respectively  and was comprised of the following in thousands discount rate assumption health care cost trend claims experience return on plan assets other unrecognized net actuarial loss restructuring accruals over the past several years  we have recorded restructuring accruals as a result of facility closings and other cost management efforts 
cost management is one of our strategic objectives and we are continually seeking ways to lower our cost structure 
the acquisition of nebs resulted in even larger restructuring accruals as we combined the two companies and exited certain activities 
these accruals primarily consist of employee termination benefits payable under our ongoing severance benefit plan 
we record accruals for employee termination benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable 
as such  judgment is involved in determining when it is appropriate to record restructuring accruals 
additionally  we are required to make estimates and assumptions in calculating the restructuring accruals  as many times employees choose to voluntarily leave the company prior to their termination date or they secure another position within the company 
in these situations  the employees do not receive termination benefits 
to the extent our assumptions and estimates differ from actual employee behavior  subsequent adjustments to restructuring accruals have been and will be required 
we reversed restructuring accruals of million in  million in and million in as a result of fewer employees receiving severance benefits than originally estimated 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the new standard defines the threshold for recognizing the benefits of tax return positions in the financial statements as more likely than not to be sustained by the taxing authority 
the new standard is effective for us on january  the adoption of fin no

 fair value measurements 
the new standard addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are required to use a fair value measure for recognition or disclosure purposes under gaap 
the new standard is effective for us on january  although we are still evaluating the impact of this standard  we do not expect adoption to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the new standard requires companies to measure the funded status of a plan as of the date of its year end balance sheet

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of the borrowing activities used to support our capital structure  maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
we do not enter into financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
during  we used our committed lines of credit to fund working capital requirements 
the nature and amount of debt outstanding can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of december   our total debt was comprised of the following in thousands carrying amount fair value weighted average interest rate long term notes maturing october long term notes maturing december long term notes maturing october amounts drawn on credit facilities capital lease obligations maturing through september total debt based on quoted market rates as of december   except for our capital lease obligations which are shown at carrying value 
although the fair value of our long term debt is less than its carrying amount  we do not anticipate settling our outstanding debt at its reported fair value 
the notes maturing in october do not allow settlement prior to their stated maturity  and we do not believe that settling our other long term notes is the best use of our financial resources at this time 
based on the outstanding variable rate debt in our portfolio  a one percentage point increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of million for we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
investments in and loans and advances to foreign subsidiaries and branches  as well as the operations of these businesses  are denominated in foreign currencies  primarily the canadian dollar 
the effect of exchange rate changes is expected to have a minimal impact on our results of operations and cash flows  as our foreign operations represent a relatively small portion of our business
