our md a is composed of four major sections  executive summary  results of operations  liquidity and capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates 
change in fiscal year effective december   we changed our fiscal year end from june to december this change was made to align our fiscal year end with other companies within our industry 
this md a is intended to cover the audited calendar year january  to december   which we refer to as comparative financial information to is provided in this form k with respect to the calendar year january  to december   which is unaudited and we refer to as additional information is provided with respect to the transition period july  through december  the transition period  which is audited 
we refer to the period beginning july  and ending june  as fiscal  and the period beginning july  and ending june  as fiscal executive summary we are a leading independent specialty pharmaceutical company focused primarily on helping patients attain a healthy and youthful appearance and self image through the development and marketing in the us of products for the treatment of dermatological  aesthetic and podiatric conditions 
we also market products in canada for the treatment of dermatological and aesthetic conditions 
we offer a broad range of products addressing various conditions or aesthetics improvements  including dermal fillers  acne  fungal infections  rosacea  hyperpigmentation  photoaging  psoriasis  skin and skin structure infections  seborrheic dermatitis and cosmesis improvement in the texture and appearance of skin 
our current product lines are divided between the dermatological and non dermatological fields 
our dermatological field represents products for the treatment of acne and acne related dermatological conditions and non acne dermatological conditions 
our non dermatological field represents products for the treatment of asthma until may  urea cycle disorder and contract revenue 
our acne and acne related dermatological product lines include dynacin  plexion  solodyn  triaz and ziana tm 
our non acne dermatological product lines include loprox  omnicef  restylane and vanos tm 
our non dermatological product lines include ammonul  buphenyl and orapred 
orapred was licensed to biomarin in may our non dermatological field also includes contract revenues associated with licensing agreements and authorized generic agreements 
key aspects of our business we derive a majority of our revenue from our primary products omnicef  restylane  solodyn  triaz  vanos tm and ziana tm 
we believe that sales of our primary products and perlane  which is not currently approved for use by the fda in the us  will constitute a significant portion of our sales for the foreseeable future 
we have built our business by executing a four part growth strategy promoting existing brands  developing new products and important product line extensions  entering into strategic collaborations and acquiring complementary products  technologies and businesses 
our core philosophy is to cultivate relationships of trust and 
table of contents confidence with the high prescribing dermatologists and podiatrists and the leading plastic surgeons in the united states 
as a result of customer buying patterns  a substantial portion of our product revenues has been recognized in the last month of each quarter  and we schedule our inventory purchases to meet anticipated customer demand 
as a result  miscalculation of customer demand or relatively small delays in our receipt of manufactured products could result in revenues being deferred or lost 
our operating expenses are based upon anticipated sales levels  and a high percentage of our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
depending on the customer  we recognize revenue at the time of shipment to the customer  or at the time of receipt by the customer  net of estimated provisions 
consequently  variations in the timing of revenue recognition could cause significant fluctuations in operating results from period to period and may result in unanticipated periodic earnings shortfalls or losses 
we estimate customer demand for our prescription products primarily through use of third party syndicated data sources which track prescriptions written by health care providers and dispensed by licensed pharmacies 
the data represents extrapolations from information provided only by certain pharmacies and are estimates of historical demand levels 
we estimate customer demand for our non prescription products primarily through internal data that we compile 
we observe trends from these data and  coupled with certain proprietary information  prepare demand forecasts that are the basis for our purchase orders for finished and component inventory from our third party manufacturers and suppliers 
our forecasts may fail to accurately anticipate ultimate customer demand for our products 
overestimates of demand may result in excessive inventory production and underestimates may result in inadequate supply of our products in channels of distribution 
we sell our products primarily to major wholesalers and retail pharmacy chains 
approximately of our gross revenues are derived from two major drug wholesale concerns 
while we attempt to estimate inventory levels of our products at our major wholesale customers by using historical prescription information and historical purchase patterns  this process is inherently imprecise 
rarely do wholesale customers provide us complete inventory levels at regional distribution centers  or within their national distribution systems 
we rely wholly upon our wholesale and drug chain customers to effect the distribution allocation of substantially all of our products 
based upon historically consistent purchasing patterns of our major wholesale customers  we believe our estimates of trade inventory levels of our products are reasonable 
we further believe that inventories of our products among wholesale customers  taken as a whole  are similar to those of other specialty pharmaceutical companies  and that our trade practices  which periodically involve volume discounts and early payment discounts  are typical of the industry 
we periodically offer promotions to wholesale and chain drugstore customers to encourage dispensing of our prescription products  consistent with prescriptions written by licensed health care providers 
because many of our prescription products compete in multi source markets  it is important for us to ensure the licensed health care providers dispensing instructions are fulfilled with our branded products and are not substituted with a generic product or another therapeutic alternative product which may be contrary to the licensed health care providers recommended and prescribed medicis brand 
we believe that a critical component of our brand protection program is maintenance of full product availability at drugstore and wholesale customers 
we believe such availability reduces the probability of local and regional product substitutions  shortages and backorders  which could result in lost sales 
we expect to continue providing favorable terms to wholesale and retail drug chain customers as may be necessary to ensure the fullest possible distribution of our branded products within the pharmaceutical chain of commerce 
we cannot control or significantly influence the purchasing patterns of our wholesale and retail drug chain customers 
they are highly sophisticated customers that purchase products in a manner consistent with their industry practices and  presumably  based upon their projected demand levels 
purchases by any given customer  during any given period  may be above or below actual prescription volumes of any of our products during the same period  resulting in fluctuations of product inventory in the distribution channel 

table of contents as described in more detail below  the following significant events and transactions occurred during  and affected our results of operations  our cash flows and our financial condition development and distribution agreement with ipsen for rights to ipsen s botulinum toxin type a product known as reloxin  fda approval of solodyn  loss contingency for a pending governmental investigation relating to our marketing and promotion of loprox products  write down of long lived assets due to impairment  and fda approval of ziana tm 
development and distribution agreement with ipsen for rights to ipsen s botulinum toxin type a product known as reloxin on march   we entered into a development and distribution agreement with ipsen ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of ipsen sa ipsen  whereby ipsen granted aesthetica ltd  a wholly owned subsidiary of medicis  rights to develop  distribute and commercialize ipsen s botulinum toxin type a product in the united states  canada and japan for aesthetic use by physicians 
the product is commonly referred to as reloxin in the us aesthetic market and dysport in medical and aesthetic markets outside the us the product is not currently approved for use in the us  canada or japan 
upon execution of the development and distribution agreement  we made an initial payment to ipsen in the amount of million 
additionally  we agreed to negotiate and enter into an agreement relating to the exclusive distribution and development rights of the product for the aesthetic market in europe  and subsequently in certain other markets 
under the terms of the us  canada and japan agreement  we were obligated to make an additional million payment  as amended  to ipsen if this agreement was not entered into by april  on april   we agreed with ipsen to extend this deadline to july  in connection with this extension  we paid ipsen approximately million in april  which would be applied against the total obligation  in the event an agreement was not entered into by the extended deadline 
on july   we reached a decision with ipsen to not pursue an agreement for the commercialization of the product outside of the us  canada and japan 
on july   we made the additional million payment to ipsen  representing the remaining portion of the million total obligation  resulting from the discontinuance of negotiations for other territories 
the initial million payment was recognized as a charge to research and development expense during the three months ended march   and the million obligation was recognized as a charge to research and development expense during the three months ended june  we will pay an additional million upon successful completion of various clinical and regulatory milestones  million upon the product s approval by the fda and million upon regulatory approval of the product in japan 
ipsen will manufacture and provide the product to us for the term of the agreement  which extends to september ipsen will receive a royalty based on sales and a supply price  the total of which is equivalent to approximately of net sales as defined under the agreement 
under the terms of the agreement  we are responsible for all remaining research and development costs associated with obtaining the product s approval in the us  canada and japan 
we expect to incur significant additional research and development expenses related to the development of reloxin each quarter throughout the development process 
it is our current expectation that we will file a biologic license application bla for reloxin with the fda during calendar fda approval of solodyn on may   the fda approved our new drug application for our solodyn minocycline hcl  usp extended release tablets 
solodyn is the only oral minocycline approved for once daily dosage in the treatment of inflammatory lesions of non nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in patients years of age and older 
solodyn is also the only approved minocycline in extended release tablet form 
the first sales of solodyn to our wholesale customers occurred during june 
table of contents loss contingency for a pending governmental investigation relating to our marketing and promotion of loprox products the government notified us on december   that it is investigating claims that we violated the federal false claims act in connection with the alleged off label marketing and promotion of loprox and loprox ts products to pediatricians during periods prior to our may disposition of our pediatric sales division 
in april  we offered million to resolve the government s civil claims contingent on the execution of appropriate releases 
the justice department countered with a demand of million to resolve the civil claims that the government is prepared to pursue 
in may  we countered with an offer of million that was contingent on resolving other aspects of the government s investigation to our satisfaction 
in june  the justice department countered with a million offer for settlement 
on or about october  the parties agreed in principle to resolve all federal and state civil claims against us for million 
as of december   we have accrued a loss contingency of million for this matter in connection with the possibility of additional expenses related to the settlement amount 
of this amount  million was recorded during the three months ended march   million was recorded during the three months ended june  and million was recorded during the three months ended september  on or about october   we and the united states attorney s office for the district of kansas entered into a nonprosecution agreement wherein the government agreed not to prosecute us for any alleged criminal violations relating to the alleged off label marketing and promotion of loprox 
in exchange for the government s agreement not to pursue any criminal charges against us  we have agreed to continue cooperating with the government in its ongoing investigation into whether past and present employees and officers may have violated federal criminal law regarding alleged off label marketing and promotion of loprox to pediatricians 
no individuals have been designated as targets of the investigation 
any such claims  prosecutions or other proceedings  with respect to our past and present employees and officers  the cost of their defense and fines and penalties resulting therefrom could have a material impact on our reputation  business and financial condition 
we are also engaged in discussions with the office of inspector general of the department of health and human services ig to resolve any potential administrative claims the ig may have arising out of the government s investigation into our marketing and promotion of loprox 
write down of long lived assets due to impairment we assess the potential impairment of long lived assets on a periodic basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows  the asset is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset grouping s carrying amount and its fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
during the quarter ended september   long lived assets related to certain of our products were determined to be impaired based on our analysis of the long lived assets carrying value and projected future cash flows 
as a result of the impairment analysis  we recorded a write down of approximately million related to these long lived assets 
this write down included the following in thousands long lived asset related to loprox products long lived asset related to esoterica products other long lived asset factors affecting the future cash flows of the loprox long lived asset included competitive pressures in the marketplace and the cancellation of the development plan to support future forms of loprox 
factors 
table of contents affecting the future cash flows of the esoterica long lived asset included a notice of proposed rulemaking by the fda for an nda to be required for continued marketing of hydroquinone products  such as esoterica 
esoterica is currently an over the counter product line  and we do not plan to invest in obtaining an approved nda for this product line if this proposed rule is made final without change 
in addition  as a result of the impairment analysis  the remaining amortizable lives of the long lived assets related to loprox and esoterica were reduced to fifteen years and fifteen months  respectively 
the long lived asset related to loprox will become fully amortized on september   and the long lived asset related to esoterica will become fully amortized on december  the net impact on amortization expense as a result of the write down of the carrying value of the long lived assets and the reduction of their respective amortizable lives is a decrease in quarterly amortization expense related to loprox of  and an increase in quarterly amortization expense related to esoterica of  fda approval of ziana tm on november   the fda approved ziana clindamycin phosphate and tretinoin gel for once daily use for the topical treatment of acne vulgaris in patients years or older 
we began selling ziana to wholesale customers during the fourth quarter of in accordance with the terms of a development and license agreement  as amended  we paid dow million during the fourth quarter of as a result of the fda s approval of this product

net revenues associated with our acne and acne related dermatological products decreased as a percentage of net revenues  but increased in net dollars by primarily due to an increase in plexion net revenues due to the launch of plexion cleansing cloths during the first quarter of fiscal net revenues associated with our non acne dermatological products decreased as a percentage of net revenues  but increased in net dollars by during fiscal  primarily due to the launch of restylane in the united states in january and the launch of vanos tm in april  partially offset by a decrease in loprox net revenues due to increased competition from generic products launched during fiscal net revenues associated with our non dermatological products increased as a percentage of net revenues primarily due to the increase in contract revenues associated with the outlicensing of the orapred and lustra brands  which was greater than the revenues generated by those products for the comparable period during fiscal contract revenue during fiscal included fees derived from authorized generics launched on our behalf 
gross profit gross profit represents our net revenues less our cost of product revenue 
our cost of product revenue includes our acquisition cost for the products we purchase from our third party manufacturers and royalty payments made to third parties 
amortization of intangible assets related to acquired products is not included in gross profit 
amortization expense related to these intangibles for fiscal and fiscal was approximately million and million  respectively 
product mix plays a significant role in our quarterly and annual gross profit as a percentage of net revenues 
different products generate different gross profit margins  and the relative mix of higher gross profit products and lower gross profit products can affect our total gross profit 

table of contents the following table sets forth our gross profit for fiscal and fiscal  along with the percentage of net revenues represented by such gross profit dollar amounts in millions fiscal fiscal change change gross profit of net revenues the increase in gross profit during fiscal as compared to fiscal was due to the increase in our net revenues  while the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to the different mix of products sold during fiscal as compared to during fiscal  and an increase in contract revenue during fiscal as compared to fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses the following table sets forth our selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal and fiscal  along with the percentage of net revenues represented by selling  general and administrative expenses dollar amounts in millions fiscal fiscal change change selling  general and administrative of net revenues the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to incremental costs associated with restylane  million of business integration planning costs related to the proposed merger with inamed and approximately million of professional fees related to research and development collaborations 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues from fiscal to fiscal was due to net revenues during fiscal  which exceeded the increase in selling  general and administrative spending 
a pre market approval application for restylane was approved by the fda on december   followed by the product launch and first us commercial sales of restylane on january  during fiscal  we incurred incremental costs associated with the establishment of a sales and marketing strategy for restylane  prior to the commercial launch of the product

included in research and development expenses for fiscal was a million milestone payment under a license and development agreement with dow for ziana tm 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expenses depreciation and amortization expenses during fiscal increased million  or  to million from million during fiscal this increase was primarily due to the amortization of expenses related to the million and million milestone payments made to q med in december and may  respectively  which are being amortized over the period from the date of payment through january and increased amortization related to certain intangible assets whose useful lives were determined to be shorter than originally estimated 
interest and investment income interest and investment income during fiscal increased million  or  to million from million during fiscal  primarily due to an increase in the rates achieved by our invested funds during fiscal interest expense interest expense during fiscal decreased million  or  to million from million during fiscal this decrease was due to the august exchange of a portion of our old notes  which accrue interest at per annum  for our new notes  which accrue interest at per annum

during july  we executed a lease agreement for new headquarter office space to accommodate our expected long term growth 
the first phase is for approximately  square feet with the right to expand 
occupancy of the new headquarter office space  which is located approximately one mile from our current headquarter office space in scottsdale  arizona  is expected to occur in during october  we executed a lease agreement for additional headquarter office space to accommodate our current needs and future growth 
approximately  square feet of office space is being leased for a period of three years 
occupancy of the additional headquarter office space  which is located approximately one mile from our current headquarter office space in scottsdale  arizona  is expected to occur in during and  we will be designing and implementing a new erp system to integrate and improve the financial and operational aspects of our business 
we are committed to having the information technology system in place that will allow us to better operate and manage all aspects of our operations 
we have dedicated approximately of our employees to various aspects of the project  along with third party consultants

table of contents investing activities net cash used in investing activities during the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to net cash provided by investing activities during the unaudited year ended december  of million 
the change was primarily due to the net purchases or sales of our short term and long term investments during the respective periods

the change is primarily attributable to the purchase of million of our common stock during the comparable six months while no cash was used to purchase our common stock during the transition period  as well as million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options received during the comparable six months  as compared to million received during the transition period 
net cash used in financing activities during fiscal was million compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million during fiscal the change is primarily attributable to the purchase of million of our common stock during fiscal while no cash was used to purchase our common stock during fiscal  as well as million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options received during fiscal  as compared to million received during fiscal contingent convertible senior notes and other long term commitments on august   we exchanged million in principal amount of our old notes for million in principal amount of our new notes 
holders of old notes that accepted the company s exchange offer received  in principal amount of new notes for each  in principal amount of old notes 
the terms of the new notes are similar to the terms of the old notes  but have a different interest rate  conversion rate and maturity date 
holders of old notes that did not exchange will continue to be subject to the terms of the old notes 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 

table of contents the new notes and the old notes are unsecured and do not contain any restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness or the repurchase of our securities  and do not contain any financial covenants 
the old notes do not contain any restrictions on the payment of dividends 
the new notes require an adjustment to the conversion price if the cumulative aggregate of all current and prior dividend increases above per share would result in at least a one percent increase in the conversion price 
this threshold has not been reached and no adjustment to the conversion price has been made 
except for the old notes  the new notes and deferred tax liabilities  we have no long term liabilities and had only million of current liabilities at december  our other commitments and planned expenditures consist principally of payments we will make in connection with strategic collaborations and research and development expenditures  and we will continue to invest in sales and marketing infrastructure 
in addition  we will be implementing a new erp system during and  which will require financial expenditures to complete 
we have made available to biomarin the ability to draw down on a convertible note up to million beginning july  the convertible note 
the convertible note is convertible based on certain terms and conditions including a change of control provision 
money advanced under the convertible note is convertible into biomarin shares at a strike price equal to the biomarin average closing price for the trading days prior to such advance 
the convertible note matures on the option purchase date in as defined in the securities purchase agreement entered into on may  the securities purchase agreement but may be repaid by biomarin at any time prior to the option purchase date 
as of february   biomarin has not requested any monies to be advanced under the convertible note  and no amounts are outstanding 
repurchases of common stock in may  our board of directors approved a new repurchase program that authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock 
this program provided for the repurchase of class a common stock at such times as management determined 
as of june   we had not repurchased any shares of our class a common stock under this program 
in august  our board of directors approved a new program that replaced the may program  which authorized the repurchase of up to million of our class a common stock 
during the first two quarters of fiscal  we purchased a total of  shares of our class a common stock in the open market at an average price of per share  for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
as the purchase limit had been reached  the plan was terminated during the second quarter of fiscal dividends we do not have a dividend policy 
since july  we have paid quarterly cash dividends aggregating approximately million on our common stock 
in addition  on december   we declared a cash dividend of per issued and outstanding share of common stock payable on january  to our stockholders of record at the close of business on january  prior to these dividends  we had not paid a cash dividend on our common stock 
any future determinations to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition  operating results  capital requirements and other factors that our board of directors deems relevant 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we are not involved in any off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations at december   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at december  or certain other purchase obligations as discussed below in thousands payments due by period more than more than year and years and less than less than less than more than total year years years years long term debt interest on long term debt operating leases other purchase obligations and commitments total contractual obligations the long term debt consists of the company s old notes and new notes 
the table above reflects the maturity date of debt 
however  the company may redeem some or all of the old notes and new notes at any time on or after june  and june   respectively  at a redemption price  payable in cash  of of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  including contingent interest  if any 
holders of the old notes and new notes may require the company to repurchase all or a portion of their old notes on june   and and new notes on june   and  or upon a change in control  as defined in the indenture agreements governing the old notes and new notes  at of the principal amount of the old notes and new notes  plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of the repurchase  payable in cash 
interest on long term debt includes interest payable on our old notes and new notes  assuming the old notes and new notes will not have any redemptions or conversions into shares of our class a common stock until their respective maturities in and  but does not include any contingent interest 
the amount of interest ultimately paid in future years could change if any of the old notes or new notes are converted or redeemed and or if contingent interest becomes payable if certain future criteria are met 
other purchase obligations and commitments include payments due under research and development and consulting contracts 
we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of certain product development and license agreements 
payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement and timing of these milestones are not fixed or reasonably determinable  such contingencies have not been recorded on our consolidated balance sheets and are not included in the above table 
the total amount of potential future milestone payments related to development and license agreements is approximately million 
purchase orders for raw materials  finished goods and other goods and services are not included in the above table 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purpose of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and are fulfilled by our vendors with relatively short timetables 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or finished goods specifying 
table of contents minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our short term expected requirements 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates related to sales allowances  chargebacks  rebates  returns and other pricing adjustments  depreciation and amortization and other contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other factors related to each circumstance 
actual results could differ from those estimates based upon future events  which could include  among other risks  changes in the regulations governing the manner in which we sell our products  changes in the health care environment and managed care consumption patterns 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our most significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and are important in understanding our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenue from our product sales is recognized pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  revenue recognition in financial statements 
accordingly  revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products has occurred  iii the selling price is both fixed and determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
we do not provide any material forms of price protection to our wholesale customers and permit product returns if the product is damaged  or  depending on the customer  if it is returned within six months prior to expiration or up to months after expiration 
our customers consist principally of financially viable wholesalers  and depending on the customer  revenue is recognized based upon shipment fob shipping point or receipt fob destination  net of estimated provisions 
as a general practice  we do not ship product that has less than months until its expiration date 
we also authorize returns for damaged products and credits for expired products in accordance with our returned goods policy and procedures 
the shelf life associated with our products is up to months depending on the product 
the majority of our products have a shelf life of approximately months 
we enter into licensing arrangements with other parties whereby we receive contract revenue based on the terms of the agreement 
the timing of revenue recognition is dependent on the level of our continuing involvement in the manufacture and delivery of licensed products 
if we have continuing involvement  the revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the period of continuing involvement 
in addition  if our licensing arrangements require no continuing involvement and payments are merely based on the passage of time  we assess such payments for revenue recognition under the collectibility criteria of sab items deducted from gross revenue provisions for estimates for product returns and exchanges  sales discounts  chargebacks  managed care and medicaid rebates and other adjustments are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized 
these deductions from gross revenue are established by us as our best estimate at the time of sale based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 

table of contents these deductions from gross revenue are generally reflected either as a direct reduction to accounts receivable through an allowance  or as an addition to accrued expenses if the payment is due to a party other than the wholesale or retail customer 
our accounting policies for revenue recognition have a significant impact on our reported results and rely on certain estimates that require complex and subjective judgment on the part of our management 
if the levels of product returns and exchanges  cash discounts  chargebacks  managed care and medicaid rebates and other adjustments fluctuate significantly and or if our estimates do not adequately reserve for these reductions of gross product revenues  our reported net product revenues could be negatively affected 
product returns we account for returns of product by establishing an allowance based on our estimate of revenues recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned in the future 
we estimate the rate of future product returns based on our historical experience  the relative risk of return based on expiration date  and other qualitative factors that could impact the level of future product returns  such as competitive developments  product discontinuations and our introduction of new products 
historical experience and the other qualitative factors are assessed on a product specific basis as part of our compilation of our estimate of future product returns 
we also monitor inventories held by our distributors  as well as prescription trends to help us assess the rate of return 
changes due to our competitors price movements have not adversely affected us 
we do not provide incentives to our distributors to assume additional inventory levels beyond what is customary in their ordinary course of business 
returns for new products are more difficult to estimate than returns for established products 
we determine our estimates of the sales return accrual for new products primarily based on our historical product returns experience of similar products  products that have similar characteristics at various stages of their life cycle  and other available information pertinent to the intended use and marketing of the new product 
our actual experience and the qualitative factors that we use to determine the necessary accrual for future product returns are susceptible to change based on unforeseen events and uncertainties 
we assess the trends that could affect our estimates and make changes to the accrual quarterly 
sales discounts we offer cash discounts to our customers as an incentive for prompt payment  generally approximately of the sales price 
we account for cash discounts by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable by the full amount of the discounts expected to be taken by the customers 
we consider payment performance and adjust the allowance to reflect actual experience and our current expectations about future activity 
contract chargebacks we have agreements for contract pricing with several entities  whereby pricing on products is extended below wholesaler list price 
these parties purchase products through wholesalers at the lower contract price  and the wholesalers charge the difference between their acquisition cost and the lower contract price back to us 
we account for chargebacks by establishing an allowance reducing accounts receivable based on our estimate of chargeback claims attributable to a sale 
we determine our estimate of chargebacks based on historical experience and changes to current contract prices 
we also consider our claim processing lag time  and adjust the allowance periodically throughout each quarter to reflect actual experience 
although we record an allowance for estimated chargebacks at the time we record the sale typically when we ship the product  the actual chargeback related to that sale is not processed until the entities purchase the product from the wholesaler 
we estimate the rate of chargebacks based on our historical experience and changes to current contract prices 

table of contents managed care and medicaid rebates rebates are contractual discounts offered to government programs and private health plans that are eligible for such discounts at the time prescriptions are dispensed  subject to various conditions 
we record provisions for rebates by estimating these liabilities as products are sold  based on factors such as timing and terms of plans under contract  time to process rebates  product pricing  sales volumes  amount of inventory in the distribution channel  and prescription trends 
other in addition to the significant items deducted from gross revenue described above  we deduct other items from gross revenue 
for example  we offer consumer rebates on many of our products and a consumer loyalty program for our restylane dermal filler product 
we generally account for these other items deducted from gross revenue by establishing an accrual based on our estimate of the adjustments attributable to a sale 
we generally base our estimates for the accrual of these items deducted from gross sales on historical experience and other relevant factors 
we adjust our accruals periodically throughout each quarter based on actual experience and changes in other factors  if any 
use of information from external sources we use information from external sources to estimate our significant items deducted from gross revenues 
our estimates of inventory in the distribution channel are based on historical shipment and return information from our accounting records and data on prescriptions filled  which we purchase from ims health  inc  one of the leading providers of prescription based information 
we also utilize projected prescription demand for our products  as well as  written and oral information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and our internal information 
we use the information from ims health  inc to project the prescription demand for our products 
our estimates are subject to inherent limitations pertaining to reliance on third party information  as certain third party information is itself in the form of estimates 
use of estimates in reserves we believe that our allowances and accruals for items that are deducted from gross revenues are reasonable and appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
it is possible  however  that other parties applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop different allowance and accrual amounts for items that are deducted from gross revenues 
additionally  changes in actual experience or changes in other qualitative factors could cause our allowances and accruals to fluctuate  particularly with newly launched products 
we review the rates and amounts in our allowance and accrual estimates on a quarterly basis 
if future estimated rates and amounts are significantly greater than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would decrease our reported net revenues  conversely  if actual returns  rebates and chargebacks are significantly less than those reflected in our recorded reserves  the resulting adjustments to those reserves would increase our reported net revenues 
if we changed our assumptions and estimates  our related reserves would change  which would impact the net revenues we report 
for example  if the prescription data used to estimate inventory in the distribution channel changed by percent and our historical returns reserve percent were to change by percentage point our sales returns reserve could be impacted by approximately million and corresponding revenue could be impacted by the same amount 
during the three months ended december   we experienced a decline in demand for certain of our products  primarily vanos 
as a result  we increased the sales returns reserves by approximately million during the three months ended december   specifically related to vanos 
we will continue to monitor demand for this product and will adjust our sales reserves accordingly in the future 
the effect of this change on the net loss for was to increase the net loss by approximately million or per common share 

table of contents share based compensation as part of our adoption of sfas no 
r as of july   we were required to recognize the fair value of share based compensation awards as an expense 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards at the date of grant requires judgment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of employee stock options 
option pricing models  including the black scholes model  also require the use of input assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  expected dividend rate  and expected risk free rate of return 
we use a blend of historical and implied volatility based on options freely traded in the open market as we believe this is more reflective of market conditions and a better indicator of expected volatility than using purely historical volatility 
increasing the weighted average volatility by percent from percent to percent would have increased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
conversely  decreasing the weighted average volatility by percent from percent to percent would have decreased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
the expected life of the awards is based on historical and other economic data trended into the future 
stock option awards granted during have a stated term of years  and the weighted average expected life of the awards was determined to be years 
decreasing the weighted average expected life by years from years to years would have decreased the fair value of stock options granted in to per share 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on observed interest rates appropriate for the terms of our awards 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of future dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock grants is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant discounted for expected future dividends 
sfas no 
r requires us to develop an estimate of the number of share based awards which will be forfeited due to employee turnover 
quarterly changes in the estimated forfeiture rate may have a significant effect on share based compensation  as the effect of adjusting the rate for all expense amortization after july  is recognized in the period the forfeiture estimate is changed 
if the actual forfeiture rate is higher than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to increase the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in a decrease to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
if the actual forfeiture rate is lower than the estimated forfeiture rate  then an adjustment is made to decrease the estimated forfeiture rate  which will result in an increase to the expense recognized in the financial statements 
the effect of forfeiture adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal was immaterial 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value our awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what was recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense and unearned stock based compensation will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards to employees or we assume unvested equity awards in connection with acquisitions 
our estimates of these important assumptions are based on historical data and judgment regarding market trends and factors 
if actual results are not consistent with our assumptions and judgments used in estimating these factors  we may be required to record additional stock based compensation expense or income tax expense  which could be material to our results of operations 
inventory inventory costs associated with products that have not yet received regulatory approval are capitalized if we believe there is probable future commercial use and future economic benefit 
if future commercial use and future economic benefit are not considered probable  then costs associated with pre launch inventory that has not yet received regulatory approval are expensed as research and development expense during the period the costs are incurred 
we could be required to expense previously capitalized costs related to pre approval inventory if the probability of future commercial use and future economic benefit changes due to denial or delay of regulatory approval  a delay in commercialization  or other factors 
conversely  our gross margins could be favorably impacted 
table of contents if previously expensed pre approval inventory becomes available and is used for commercial sale 
as of december   there no costs capitalized into inventory for products that have not yet received regulatory approval 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends  and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to our estimate of the related total future net cash flows 
if an asset carrying value is not recoverable through the related cash flows  the asset is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the asset grouping s carrying amount and its fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
when we determine that the useful lives of assets are shorter than we had originally estimated  and there are sufficient cash flows to support the carrying value of the assets  we accelerate the rate of amortization charges in order to fully amortize the assets over their new shorter useful lives 
during and the transition period  an impairment charge of million and million  respectively  was recognized related to our review of long lived assets 
during  the remaining useful lives of two of the long lived assets that were deemed to be impaired were reduced  while no acceleration of amortization was recorded during the transition period 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges for  and or accelerate amortization of  long lived assets 
income taxes income taxes are determined using an annual effective tax rate  which generally differs from the us federal statutory rate because of state and local income taxes  tax exempt interest  charitable contribution deductions  nondeductible expenses and research and development tax credits available in the us our effective tax rate may be subject to fluctuations during the year as new information is obtained which may affect the assumptions we use to estimate our annual effective tax rate  including factors such as our mix of pre tax earnings in the various tax jurisdictions in which we operate  valuation allowances against deferred tax assets  reserves for tax audit issues and settlements  utilization of research and development tax credits and changes in tax laws in jurisdictions where we conduct operations 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities 
we record valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets to reduce the net carrying value to an amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
based on the company s historical pre tax earnings  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefit of the existing net deferred tax assets at december  management believes the existing net deductible temporary differences will reverse during periods in which the company generates net taxable income  however  there can be no assurance that the company will generate any earnings or any specific level of continuing earnings in future years 
certain tax planning or other strategies could be implemented  if necessary  to supplement income from operations to fully realize recorded tax benefits 
research and development costs and accounting for strategic collaborations all research and development costs  including payments related to products under development and research consulting agreements  are expensed as incurred 
we may continue to make non refundable payments to third parties for new technologies and for research and development work that has been completed 
these payments may be expensed at the time of payment depending on the nature of the payment made 

table of contents our policy on accounting for costs of strategic collaborations determines the timing of our recognition of certain development costs 
in addition  this policy determines whether the cost is classified as development expense or capitalized as an asset 
we are required to form judgments with respect to the commercial status of such products in determining whether development costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
for example  when we acquire certain products for which there is already an anda or nda approval related directly to the product  and there is net realizable value based on projected sales for these products  we capitalize the amount paid as an intangible asset 
in addition  if we acquire product rights which are in the development phase and as to which we have no assurance that the third party will successfully complete its development milestones or that the product will gain regulatory approval  we expense such payments 
legal contingencies we record contingent liabilities resulting from asserted and unasserted claims against us  when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
we disclose material contingent liabilities  when there is a reasonable possibility  that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded liability 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors  in some cases including judgments about the potential actions of third party claimants and courts 
therefore  actual losses in any future period are inherently uncertain 
we currently are involved in certain legal proceedings and we have accrued a loss contingency of million as of december   related to one matter 
this loss contingency is included in other current liabilities as of december  in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  and is included in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
in addition to the matters disclosed in item legal proceedings  we are party to ordinary and routine litigation incidental to our business 
we do not expect the outcome of any pending litigation  other than those specified in item legal proceedings  to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure  and transition 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating fin but do not expect it to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands the disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently evaluating sfas no 
and its impact  if any  on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial statements and financial liabilities  which provides companies with an option to report selected financial assets and liabilities at fair value 
sfas no 
requires companies to provide additional information that will help investors and other users of financial statements to more easily understand the effect of the company s choice to use fair value on its earnings 
it also requires entities to display the fair value of those assets and liabilities for which the company has chosen to use fair value on the face of the balance sheet 
the new statement does not eliminate disclosure requirements included in other accounting standards  including requirements for disclosures about fair value measurements included in fasb statements no 
 fair value measurements  and no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
we are currently evaluating sfas no 
and its impact  if any  on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk at december   million of our cash equivalent investments are in money market securities that are reflected as cash equivalents  because all maturities are within days 
included in money market securities are commercial paper  federal agency discount notes and money market funds 
our interest rate risk with respect to these investments is limited due to the short term duration of these arrangements and the yields earned  which approximate current interest rates 
our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities that we hold on an available for sale basis  was approximately million as of december   million as of december   million as of june   and million as of june  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows if market interest rates increase 
the following table provides information about our available for sale securities that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we have aggregated our available for sale securities for presentation purposes since they are all very similar in nature dollar amounts in thousands interest rate sensitivity principal amount by expected maturity as of december  financial instruments mature during year ended december  thereafter available for sale securities weighted average yield rate contingent convertible senior notes due interest rate contingent convertible senior notes due interest rate changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense incurred on our contingent convertible senior notes as the interest rates are fixed 
we have not entered into derivative financial instruments 
we have minimal operations outside of the united states and  accordingly  we have not been susceptible to significant risk from changes in foreign currencies 
during the normal course of business we could be subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discussed above  and collectibility of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
