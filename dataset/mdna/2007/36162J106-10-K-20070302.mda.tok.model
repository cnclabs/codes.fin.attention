the universal shelf registration statement provides for the offer and sale by us  from time to time  on a delayed basis  of up to million aggregate amount of our common stock  preferred stock  debt securities  warrants  and or depositary shares 
these securities  which may be offered in one or more offerings and in any combination  will in each case be offered pursuant to a separate prospectus supplement issued at the time of the particular offering that will describe the specific types  amounts  prices and terms of the offered securities

until a right is exercised  the holder of the right has no right to vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder as a result of holding the right 
the rights trade automatically with shares of our common stock  and may only be exercised in connection with certain attempts to acquire our company 
the rights are designed to protect the interests of our company and our shareholders against coercive acquisition tactics and encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors before attempting an acquisition 
the rights may  but are not intended to  deter acquisition proposals that may be in the interests of our shareholders 
critical accounting policies we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development  selection and application of our critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and our audit committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to our critical accounting policies in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we routinely evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that our management believes are reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition  and related interpretations 
facility management revenues are recognized as services are provided under facility management contracts with approved government appropriations based on a net rate per day per inmate or on a fixed monthly rate 
project development and design revenues are recognized as earned on a percentage of completion basis measured by the percentage of costs incurred to date as compared to estimated total cost for each contract 

table of contents this method is used because we consider costs incurred to date to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts and changes to cost estimates are made in the period in which we determine that such losses and changes are probable 
typically  we enter into fixed price contracts and do not perform additional work unless approved change orders are in place 
costs attributable to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which the costs are incurred if we believe that it is not probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price 
if we believe that it is probable that the costs will be recovered through a change in the contract price  costs related to unapproved change orders are expensed in the period in which they are incurred  and contract revenue is recognized to the extent of the cost incurred 
revenue in excess of the costs attributable to unapproved change orders is not recognized until the change order is approved 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
changes in job performance  job conditions  and estimated profitability  including those arising from contract penalty provisions  and final contract settlements  may result in revisions to estimated costs and income  and are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
we extend credit to the governmental agencies we contract with and other parties in the normal course of business as a result of billing and receiving payment for services thirty to sixty days in arrears 
further  we regularly review outstanding receivables  and provide estimated losses through an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in evaluating the level of established loss reserves  we make judgments regarding our customers ability to make required payments  economic events and other factors 
as the financial condition of these parties change  circumstances develop or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
we also perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and generally do not require collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  and such losses traditionally have been within our expectations 
reserves for insurance losses claims for which we are insured arising from our us operations that have an occurrence date of october  or earlier are handled by twc and are commercially insured up to an aggregate limit of between million and million  depending on the nature of the claim and the applicable policy terms and conditions 
with respect to claims for which we are insured arising after october   we maintain a general liability policy for all us corrections operations with million per occurrence and in the aggregate 
on october   we increased our deductible on this general liability policy from million to million for each claim which occurs after october  geo care  inc is separately insured for general and professional liability 
coverage is maintained with limits of million per occurrence and in the aggregate subject to a million self insured retention 
we also maintain insurance to cover property and casualty risks  workers compensation  medical malpractice  environmental liability and automobile liability 
our australian subsidiary is required to carry tail insurance on a general liability policy providing an extended reporting period through related to a discontinued contract 
we also carry various types of insurance with respect to our operations in south africa  the united kingdom and australia 
there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage will be adequate to cover all claims to which we may be exposed 
since our insurance policies generally have high deductible amounts including a million per claim deductible under our general liability and auto liability policies and a million per claim deductible under our workers compensation policy  losses are recorded as reported and a provision is made to cover losses incurred but not reported 
loss reserves are undiscounted and are computed based on independent actuarial studies 
our management uses judgments in assessing loss estimates based on actuarial studies  which include actual claim amounts and loss development based on both geo s own historical experience and industry experience 
if actual losses related to insurance claims significantly differ from our estimates  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially impacted 
certain geo facilities located in florida and determined by insurers to be in high risk hurricane areas carry substantial windstorm deductibles of up to million 
since hurricanes are considered unpredictable future events  no reserves have been established to pre fund for potential windstorm damage 
limited 
table of contents commercial availability of certain types of insurance relating to windstorm exposure in coastal areas and earthquake exposure mainly in california may prevent us from insuring our facilities to full replacement value 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with financial accounting standards  or fas  no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes are determined based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities given the provisions of enacted tax laws 
deferred income tax provisions and benefits are based on changes to the assets or liabilities from year to year 
valuation allowances are recorded related to deferred tax assets based on the more likely than not criteria of fas no 
in providing for deferred taxes  we consider tax regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate  and estimates of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies 
if tax regulations  operating results or the ability to implement tax planning strategies vary  adjustments to the carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities may be required 
property and equipment as of december   we had approximately million in long lived property and equipment 
property and equipment are stated at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets 
buildings and improvements are depreciated over to years 
equipment and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over to years 
accelerated methods of depreciation are generally used for income tax purposes 
leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight line basis over the shorter of the useful life of the improvement or the term of the lease 
we perform ongoing evaluations of the estimated useful lives of our property and equipment for depreciation purposes 
the estimated useful lives are determined and continually evaluated based on the period over which services are expected to be rendered by the asset 
maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred 
we review long lived assets to be held and used for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully recoverable in accordance with fas no 
accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets 
determination of recoverability is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
measurement of an impairment loss for long lived assets that management expects to hold and use is based on the fair value of the asset 
long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
management has reviewed our long lived assets and determined that there are no events requiring impairment loss recognition for the period ended december  events that would trigger an impairment assessment include deterioration of profits for a business segment that has long lived assets  or when other changes occur which might impair recovery of long lived assets 
stock based compensation expense we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of the stock based awards  which includes estimates of stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected lives  requires judgment that could materially impact our operating results

we experienced significant adverse claims development in general liability and workers compensation in the late s 
beginning in approximately  we made significant operational changes and began to aggressively manage our risk in a proactive manner 
these changes have resulted in improved claims experience and loss development  which we are realizing in our actuarial projections 
as a result of improving loss trends  our independent actuary reduced its expected losses for claims arising since october  we have adjusted our reserve at october  and october  to reflect the actuary s expected loss

similarly  operating expenses reflect a million reduction in insurance reserves also attributable to improved actuarial loss projections

financial condition liquidity and capital resources on january   we completed the refinancing of our senior credit facility through the execution of the amended senior credit facility  by and among geo  as borrower  bnp paribas  as administrative agent  bnp paribas securities corp  as lead arranger and syndication agent  and the lenders who are  or may from time to time become  a party thereto 
the amended senior credit facility consists of a million year term loan referred to as the term loan b and a million year revolver  expiring september   referred to as the revolver 
the initial interest rate for the term loan b is libor plus 
the revolver would bear interest at libor plus or at the base rate plus 
on january   geo used the million in borrowings under the term loan b to finance geo s acquisition of cpt 
current cash requirements consist of amounts needed for working capital  debt service  capital expenditures  supply purchases and investments in joint ventures 
our primary source of liquidity to meet these requirements is cash flow from operations and  after january   borrowings from the million revolver under our amended senior credit facility 
as of december   we had million available for borrowing under the revolving portion of the senior credit facility 
we incurred substantial indebtedness in connection with the acquisition cpt on january   csc on november  and the share purchase in as of december   we had million of consolidated debt outstanding  excluding million of non recourse debt 
as of december   we also had outstanding seven letters of guarantee totaling approximately million under separate international 
table of contents credit facilities 
as a result of the refinancing of our senior credit facility we have million consolidated debt outstanding  excluding non recourse debt 
after giving effect to these borrowings  we currently have approximately million in total consolidated long term indebtedness  excluding non recourse debt of million and capital lease liability balances of million 
based on our debt covenants and the amount of indebtedness we have outstanding  we currently have the ability to borrow an additional approximately million under our amended senior credit facility 
our significant debt service obligations could have material consequences 
see risk factors risks related to our high level of indebtedness 
however  our management believes that cash on hand  cash flows from operations and our senior credit facility will be adequate to support currently planned business expansion and various obligations incurred in the operation of our business  both on a near and long term basis 
in the future  our access to capital and ability to compete for future capital intensive projects will be dependent upon  among other things  our ability to meet certain financial covenants in the indenture governing the notes and in our senior credit facility 
a substantial decline in our financial performance could limit our access to capital and have a material adverse affect on our liquidity and capital resources and  as a result  on our financial condition and results of operations 
our business requires us to make various capital expenditures from time to time  including expenditures related to the development of new correctional  detention and or mental health facilities 
in addition  some of our management contracts require us to make substantial initial expenditures of cash in connection with opening or renovating a facility 
generally  these initial expenditures are subsequently fully or partially recoverable as pass through costs or are billable as a component of the per diem rates or monthly fixed fees to the contracting agency over the original term of the contract 
however  we cannot assure you that any of these expenditures will  if made  be recovered 
based on current estimates of our capital needs  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will range from million to million during the next months 
we are in the process of a bed expansion of val verde correctional facility in del rio  texas for approximately million 
the expansion is expected to be completed in the third quarter of additionally  as a result of the acquisition of cpt  we will fund an expansion of delaney hall  a facility which we do not operate  for approximately million  with expected completion in the first quarter capital expenditures related to other facility expansions and normal operating activities are expected to range between million and million 
our range of million to million for capital needs includes potential capital expenditures related to expansion of existing facilities if we receive new contracts or contract modifications 
we plan to fund these capital expenditures from cash from operations  borrowings under the amended senior credit facility or other financings 
we have entered into individual executive retirement agreements with our ceo and chairman  president and vice chairman  and chief financial officer 
these agreements provide each executive with a lump sum payment upon retirement 
under the agreements  each executive may retire at any time after reaching the age of each of the executives reached the eligible retirement age of in none of the executives have indicated their intent to retire as of this time 
however  under the retirement agreements  retirement may be taken at any time at the individual executive s discretion 
in the event that all three executives were to retire in the same year  we believe we will have funds available to pay the retirement obligations from various sources  including cash on hand  operating cash flows or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
based on our current capitalization  we do not believe that making these payments in any one period  whether in separate installments or in the aggregate  would materially adversely impact our liquidity 
we are exposed to various commitments and contingencies which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations

changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in earnings along with related designated changes in the value of the notes

cash provided by operating activities of continuing operations in was negatively impacted by an increase in accounts receivable 
the increase in accounts receivable is attributable to the increase in value of our australian subsidiary s accounts receivable due to an increase in foreign exchange rates  the addition of csc for the entire year  new contracts at new castle  the south florida evaluation and treatment center  fort bayard medical center and campsfield house as well as slightly higher billings reflecting a general increase in facility occupancy levels

we do not have any additional off balance sheet arrangements which would subject us to additional liabilities 
inflation we believe that inflation  in general  did not have a material effect on our results of operations during  and while some of our contracts include provisions for inflationary indexing  inflation could have a substantial adverse effect on our results of operations in the future to the extent that wages and salaries  which represent our largest expense  increase at a faster rate than the per diem or fixed rates received by us for our management services 
outlook the following discussion of our future performance contains statements that are not historical statements and  therefore  constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated or implied in the forward looking statement 
please refer to item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k  the forward looking statements safe 
table of contents harbor  as well as the other disclosures contained in this annual report on form k  for further discussion on forward looking statements and the risks and other factors that could prevent us from achieving our goals and cause the assumptions underlying the forward looking statements and the actual results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by those forward looking statements 
the private corrections industry has played an increasingly important role in addressing us detention and correctional needs over the past five years 
since year end  the number of federal inmates held at private correctional and detention facilities has increased over percent 
at midyear  the private sector housed approximately of federal inmates 
approximately of the estimated million individuals incarcerated in the united states at year end were held in state prisons 
at midyear  the private sector housed approximately of all state inmates 
in addition to our strong position in the us market  we are the only publicly traded us correctional company with international operations 
we believe that our existing international presence positions us to capitalize on growth opportunities within the private corrections and detention industry in new and established international markets 
we intend to pursue a diversified growth strategy by winning new clients and contracts  expanding our government services portfolio and pursuing selective acquisition opportunities 
we achieve organic growth through competitive bidding that begins with the issuance by a government agency of a request for proposal  or rfp 
we primarily rely on the rfp process for organic growth in our us and international corrections operations as well as in our mental health and residential treatment services 
we believe that our long operating history and reputation have earned us credibility with both existing and prospective clients when bidding on new facility management contracts or when renewing existing contracts 
our success in the rfp process has resulted in a pipeline of new projects with significant revenue potential 
in  we announced new projects representing  beds 
in addition to pursuing organic growth through the rfp process  we will from time to time selectively consider the financing and construction of new facilities or expansions to existing facilities on a speculative basis without having a signed contract with a known client 
we also plan to leverage our experience to expand the range of government outsourced services that we provide 
we will continue to pursue selected acquisition opportunities in our core services and other government services areas that meet our criteria for growth and profitability 
revenue domestically  we continue to be encouraged by the number of opportunities that have recently developed in the privatized corrections and detention industry 
the need for additional bed space at the federal  state at local levels has been as strong as it has been at any time during the last decade  and we currently expect that trend to continue for the foreseeable future 
overcrowding at corrections facilities in various states  most recently california and arizona  and increased demand for bed space at federal prisons and detention facilities primarily resulting from government initiatives to improve immigration security are two of the factors that have contributed to the greater number of opportunities for privatization 
we plan to actively bid on any new projects that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
although we are pleased with the overall industry outlook  positive trends in the industry may be offset by several factors  including budgetary constraints  unanticipated contract terminations and contract non renewals 
in michigan  the state cancelled our baldwin correctional facility management contract in based upon the governor s veto of funding for the project 
although we do not expect this termination to represent a trend  any future unexpected terminations of our existing management contracts could have a material adverse impact on our revenues 
additionally  several of our management contracts are up for renewal and or re bid in although we have historically had a relative high contract renewal rate  there can be no assurance that we will be able to renew our management contracts scheduled to expire in on favorable terms  or at all 
internationally  in the united kingdom  we recently won our first contract since re establishing operations 
we believe that additional opportunities will become available in that market and plan to actively bid on any opportunities that fit our target profile for profitability and operational risk 
in south africa  we anticipate that the government will seek to outsource the development and operation of one or more correctional facilities in the near future 
we expect to bid on any suitable opportunities 

table of contents with respect to our mental health residential treatment services business conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary  geo care  inc  we are currently pursuing a number of business development opportunities 
in addition  we continue to expend resources on informing state and local governments about the benefits of privatization and we anticipate that there will be new opportunities in the future as those efforts begin to yield results 
we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on any suitable opportunities that become available in this area 
operating expenses operating expenses consist of those expenses incurred in the operation and management of our correctional  detention and mental health facilities 
in  operating expenses totaled approximately of our consolidated revenues 
our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue in will be impacted by several factors 
we could experience continued savings under our general liability  auto liability and workers compensation insurance program  although the amount of these potential savings cannot be predicted 
these savings  which totaled million in fiscal year and are now reflected in our current actuarial projections are a result of improved claims experience and loss development as compared to our results under our prior insurance program 
in addition  as a result of our cpt acquisition  we will no longer incur lease expense relating to the eleven facilities that we purchased in that transaction which we formerly leased from cpt 
as a result  our operating expenses will decrease by the aggregate amount of that lease expense  which totaled million in fiscal year these potential reductions in operating expenses may be offset by increased start up expenses relating to a number of new projects which we are developing  including our new graceville prison and moore haven expansion project in florida  our clayton facility in new mexico  our lawton  oklahoma prison expansion and our florence west expansion project in arizona 
overall  excluding start up expenses and the elimination of lease expense as a result of the cpt acquisition  we anticipate that operating expenses as a percentage of our revenue will remain relatively flat  consistent with our historical performance 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate management salaries and benefits  professional fees and other administrative expenses 
we have recently incurred increasing general and administrative costs including increased costs associated with increases in business development costs  professional fees and travel costs  primarily relating to our mental health residential treatment services business 
we expect this trend to continue as we pursue additional business development opportunities in all of our business lines and build the corporate infrastructure necessary to support our mental health residential treatment services business 
we also plan to continue expending resources on the evaluation of potential acquisition targets
