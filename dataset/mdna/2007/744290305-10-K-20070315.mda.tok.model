item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
transaction services and products processing claims 
the primary tool our customers use to process claims is an electronic connection supplemented by a real time web portal called mymedavant  powered by our phoenix platform 
it offers both standard and premium services and other features such as verifying a patient s insurance  enrolling with payers  tracking a claim s progress with the payer and retrieving reports from payers 
on average  we processed approximately million revenue related transactions per day in providers pay for claims processing based on either a flat monthly fee or a per transaction fee 
operating a ppo 
our ppo is called the national preferred provider network nppn tm or nppn and is accessed by more than seven million patients   physicians   acute care facilities and  ancillary care providers 
services we offer the payer community through nppn include discounts on fees when a patient uses an out of network provider and bill negotiation on non discounted claims 
we generate revenue primarily by charging participating payers a percentage of the savings they receive through nppn 
providing electronic prescription management 
medavant s prescribe tm is a desktop and online application providers use to send new prescriptions and refill requests to more than  pharmacies across the nation 
providers pay a flat fee  and pharmacy partners pay either a flat monthly fee or a per transaction fee based on transaction types 
laboratory communication solutions and products printing technology 
our intelligent printing technology is integrated into printers for labs to purchase and install in physician offices 
this allows for the secure transmittal of laboratory reports 
laboratories also purchase support  maintenance and monitoring programs to manage printers that have our integrated technology 
pilot 
this patent pending web enabled device sits in a provider s office and is used to transfer lab reports in virtually any format to a printer  a personal computer or a hand held device 
it integrates with most practice management systems and usually saves the provider the cost of a dedicated phone line 
labs either purchase pilot devices with an annual support program or they subscribe to pilot with a program that includes support services 
fleet management system  fms 
labs use this online tool to monitor printers in provider offices and receive alerts for routine problems such as a printer being out of paper or having a paper jam 
fms can also be used to monitor printer inventory and schedule regular maintenance 
labs pay a monthly fee per printer to use fms 
competitive challenges we face significant competition in each of our segments 
emdeon corporation and mckesson corporation  which acquired per se technologies  inc  per se in  are our largest competitors in claims processing 
mckesson is also one of our largest customers 
they compete on the basis of price and the number of payers which can be accessed through their networks 
larger ppos and ppos with broader representations in some geographic areas vie with nppn 
the ppo competition includes multiplan  inc  beech street concentra  and several other players  but the industry is highly fragmented  and mergers and acquisitions routinely change the face of our ppo competition 
other programs for prescription management and laboratory pr inting contend for our pharmacy and laboratory services 
see item a  risk factors  for more information on competitive challenges and strengths 
competitive strengths we believe we will be successful due primarily to six factors our technology  our data  our ability to quickly adapt to the marketplace  our expanding direct ppo connections  our independence from payers and providers  and barriers to entry 
technology the workhorse of our technology is phoenix  a transaction processing platform using a service oriented architecture with multiple processing engines 
we created phoenix more than five years ago to handle real time transactions  as well as the more traditional batch transactions for providers and payers who are not ready for real time processing of their claim data 
between and  we acquired nine companies  each with its own technology systems 
in  we began moving all transactions to phoenix to take advantage of its robust capability and dependable output 
we currently process all of our transactions on phoenix 
while examining our technology processes in  we chose to outsource our ppo operations to ppoone  a fiserv company 
we believe this decision has created a variable cost structure for this business and will reduce our hardware  software and processing costs  while allowing us to focus on expanding nppn and providing superior customer support to our clients 
our data having all our transactions on phoenix means our data is easily accessed and analyzed 
consequently  we offer total visibility into the claims processing cycle 
we provide tools for our customers to customize reports from our data and turn it into useable information 
we are seeing an increasing demand for this data  and we are exploring ways to capitalize on the demand 
of course  we continue to maintain all personal health information in a manner that is fully secure and compliant with hipaa 
adaptability in  we rolled out a premium service for claims submission and processing 
this online service features revenue cycle management tools and is called mymedavant 
this is an example of our ability to react to the market 
another example is pilot  our patent pending hardware device used to revolutionize lab report delivery for physician offices 
pilot is used by laboratories to print reports in provider offices and was developed internally as a result of listening to our laboratory customers concerns over their ability to print increasingly complicated lab reports with graphs and color charts 
expanding our ppo direct connections in  we expanded our ppo offerings by acquiring zeneks  inc  a florida company 
as a result of acquiring zeneks  we are now able to help payers negotiate prices on claims that are not discounted through another network 
we also expanded our ppo with the purchase of medical resource llc and national provider network  inc  in october this acquisition increased the number of providers with direct contacts to nppn and significantly increased nppn representation in at least six states 
having more direct provider contracts and having better geographic distribution of providers makes our ppo more attractive to payers 
while the market for ppo has decreased in recent years with pricing pressures and recent consolidations  we believe that our ppo can expand by increasing the direct provider network offered to payers 
independence we are independent of payers and vendors 
this gives us a unique advantage in this marketplace 
medavant is not an owner  or subsidiary  of any payer or vendor allowing us to work with any payer or vendor without conflicts of interest 
as a result of our independence  providers know our priorities do not favor any specific business partner and it makes us more attractive in the marketplace 
barriers to entry we have expended considerable time  effort and expense developing our infrastructure  relationships and the interoperability of our processing operations 
the cost and time demands of development and maintenance of connections from both a technical and relationship perspective represent barriers to entry for many would be competitors 
additionally  certain of our businesses are heavily regulated by various governmental entities  through hipaa and other strenuous requirements regarding internal controls and various compliance programs  which we believe are further barriers to entry 
sales and marketing we have a direct sales force and account managers with established relationships in this industry 
in addition  we partner with vendors who have contacts throughout the provider and payer communities 
most of our marketing is done through those business relationships 
we also exhibit at industry trade shows  advertise in industry publications and market through direct mail  webcasts and our website 
we significantly changed our sales and account management staff as well as their compensation programs in late to address our need to acquire and maintain revenue 
locations our largest office is in norcross  georgia  a suburb of atlanta 
we support our products and services from three other major operational facilities throughout the united states 
we operate a secure  third party processing site in atlanta  georgia  and a mirrored back up site in richardson  texas 
legislation and regulation we and our customers are subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state healthcare laws and regulations 
political  economic and regulatory influences can fundamentally alter the united states healthcare industry and  in turn  impact our business in unexpected ways 
potential reform legislation that could impact our business may include mandated basic healthcare benefits  controls on healthcare spending through limitations on the growth of private health insurance premiums and medicare and medicaid reimbursement  the creation of large insurance purchasing groups  enforcement actions of federal and state privacy laws  medicare or medicaid prescription benefit plans  state licensing requirements  or patient protection initiatives 
national provider identification by may   virtually all providers must use a ten digit national provider identification number npi as a result of a mandate in the federal register 
some small health plans have until to comply with this rule 
in  we invested considerable staff resources preparing for this because our customers currently use a variety of identification number formats 
we have modified many of our formats and processes to accommodate this new single identifier and expect to be fully prepared to use npis by this deadline 
medavant has worked closely with the workgroup for electronic data interchange wedi and other industry groups in their efforts to convince the us department of health and human services to grant a contingency that would provide more time for providers and payers to become compliant 
if a contingency period is not granted  we could experience a disruption in service to our customers if providers do not have their npis assigned by the deadline or if payers are not prepared to receive npis on their transactions by the deadline 
hipaa the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa was enacted to incrementally implement specified healthcare reforms 
hipaa s privacy rule imposes extensive requirements on healthcare providers  healthcare clearinghouses and health plans 
these covered entities must implement standards to protect and guard against the misuse of individually identifiable health information 
certain functions of ours have been or may be deemed to constitute a clearinghouse as defined by the privacy rule 
among other things  the privacy rule requires us to adopt written privacy procedures  adopt sufficient and reasonable safeguards and provide employee training with respect to compliance 
we have been certified as hipaa compliant by the electronic healthcare network accreditation commission 
in addition  our transaction processing utilizes edifecs  one of the industry s recognized leaders in hipaa validation processing systems 
the privacy regulations are broad in scope  however  and they require constant vigilance for ongoing compliance 
we also may be subject to state privacy laws  which may be more stringent than hipaa in some cases 
we are committed to maintaining our compliance with all applicable privacy laws 
hipaa also mandates the use of standard transactions for electronic claims and certain other healthcare transactions 
the us department of health and human services published regulations to govern eight of the most common electronic transactions involving health information 
as a clearinghouse  we must comply with these regulations 
hipaa s security rule imposes standards for the security of electronic protected health information 
we have implemented physical  technical and administrative safeguards for the protection of electronic protected health information 
the security rule also introduced the concept of an addressable implementation standard  which requires ongoing vigilance to ensure that employed safeguards are sufficient given current technology capabilities  threats and reasonable industry expectations 
current internal and external security auditing procedures have addressed both the required and the addressable implementation specifications by conducting risk assessments and implementing appropriate safeguards to mitigate any apparent gaps 
gramm leach bliley some of our customers may also be subject to the federal gramm leach bliley act or state laws and regulations implemented pursuant thereto  relating to certain disclosures of nonpublic personal health information and nonpublic personal financial information by insurers and health plans 
internet privacy and regulation regulatory developments related to the internet may significantly impact our business because we offer a number of internet related products 
the extent to which consumer protection and privacy laws apply to the internet is an area of uncertainty  but they may affect our ability to collect  store  use and transmit personal information 
patient consumer protection initiatives state and federal legislators and regulators have proposed initiatives to protect consumers covered by managed care plans and other health coverage 
these initiatives may result in the adoption of laws related to timely claims payment and review of claims determinations 
these laws may impact the manner in which we perform services for our clients 
provider contracting and claims regulation some state legislatures have enacted statutes that govern the terms of provider network discount arrangements and or restrict unauthorized disclosure of such arrangements 
legislatures in other states are considering adoption of similar laws 
although we believe that we operate in a manner consistent with applicable provider contracting laws  there can be no assurance that we will be in compliance with laws or regulations to be promulgated in the future or with new interpretations of existing laws 
many of our customers perform services that are governed by numerous other federal and state civil and criminal laws and in recent years have been subject to heightened scrutiny of claims practices  including fraudulent billing and payment practices 
many states also have enacted regulations requiring prompt claims payment 
to the extent that our customers reliance on any of the services we provide contributes to any alleged violation of these laws or regulations  we could be subject to indemnification claims from our customers or be included as part of an investigation of our customers practices 
federal and state consumer laws and regulations may apply to us when we provide claims services and a violation of any of these laws could subject us to fines or penalties 
licensing regulation we are subject to certain state licensing requirements for the services we provide through nppn 
some states require our ppo business to formally register and file an annual or one time accounting of networks and providers with which we contract 
given the rapid evolution of healthcare regulation  it is possible that we will be subject to future licensing requirements in any of the states where we currently perform services  or one or more states may deem our activities to be analogous to those engaged in by other participants in the healthcare industry that are now subject to licensing and other requirements  such as third party administrator or insurance regulations 
moreover  laws governing participants in the healthcare industry are not uniform among states 
as a result  we may have to undertake the expense and difficulty of obtaining any required licenses and there is a risk that we would not be able to meet the licensing requirements imposed by a particular state 
additionally  we may have to tailor our products on a state by state basis for our customers to be in compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations 
summary we anticipate that congress and state legislatures will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methods  as well as internet and healthcare privacy legislation and that public debate of these issues will likely continue in the future 
because of uncertainties as to these reform initiatives and their enactment and implementation  we cannot predict which  if any  such reform proposals will be adopted  when they may be adopted or what impact they may have on us 
while we believe our operations are in material compliance with applicable laws as currently interpreted  the regulatory environment in which we operate may change significantly in the future  which could restrict our existing operations  expansion  financial condition or opportunities for success

intellectual property and technology in large part  our success is dependent on our proprietary information and technology 
we rely on a combination of contracts  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and other measures to protect our proprietary information and technology 
we have rights under a number of patent applications filed by us or our acquired entities  in addition to rights under various trademarks and trademark applications 
we have acquired a number of copyright registrations covering our various software and proprietary products 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we generally enter into nondisclosure agreements with our employees  distributors  certain vendors and customers  and limit access to and distribution of our software  databases  documentation an d other proprietary information 
we cannot assure that the steps taken by us will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary rights or that third parties will not independently develop substantially similar products  services and technology 
although we believe our products  services and technology do not infringe on any proprietary rights of others  as the number of software products available in the market increases and the functions of those products further overlap  we and other software and internet developers may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
these claims  with or without merit  could result in costly litigation or might require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements  which may not be available on terms acceptable to us

risk factors factors that may affect future results of operations financial condition or business as discussed under the caption  cautionary statement pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of in item  certain statements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and elsewhere in this report that are not related to historical results are forward looking statements 
forward looking statements present our expectations or forecasts of future events 
you can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
they frequently are accompanied by words such as anticipate  estimate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  and other words and terms of similar meaning 
actual results may differ materially from those projected or implied in the forward looking statements 
subsequent written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements and risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other reports filed by us with the sec 
we disclaim any obligation to update any forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this report 
risks related to our business general we incurred net losses in  and we may not be able to generate positive earnings in the future and this could have a detrimental effect on the market price of our stock 
in the last three years  we have incurred substantial losses  including losses of million for the fiscal year ended december   million for the fiscal year ended december   and million in the fiscal year ended december  as of december   december   and december   we had accumulated deficits of million  million and million  respectively 
continued shortfalls could deplete our cash reserves and availability via our credit facility  making it difficult for us to obtain credit at a favorable rate or to continue investing in infrastructure we need to compete in the future 
continued shortfalls may also cause our share price to decline 
our auditors have issued a going concern opinion 
this means we may not be able to achieve our objectives and may have to suspend or cease operations 
our independent public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion as of march   with respect to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  if we cannot raise additional capital or generate sufficient revenues  or sufficiently reduce costs  to operate profitably  we may have to suspend or cease operations or significantly dilute our stockholders equity holdings 
management changes may disrupt our operations and we may not be able to retain key personnel or replace them when they leave 
although we have entered into employment agreements with many of our senior executives  the loss of any of their services could cause our business to suffer 
our success is also dependent upon our ability to hire and retain qualified operations  development and other personnel 
competition for qualified personnel in the healthcare information services industry is intense and we cannot assure that we will be able to hire or retain the personnel necessary for our planned operations 
we have senior and subordinated debt that matures during and we have senior and subordinated debt in the aggregate principal amount of million that matures through  of which million is due by december we currently do not have the resources to repay this debt in full 
if we are unable to obtain additional funding to repay or refinance our senior and subordinated debt prior to maturity  the lenders could foreclose and take certain other action against us 
the effect on our operations and stock price could be significantly negative and we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
laurus master fund  ltd 
laurus  our largest lender  has the subjective and unilateral ability to call our debt 
such an event would negatively impact our ability to operate as a solvent and on going concern 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate 
we have purchased directors and officers  casualty  property and general liability coverage which management believes is adequate for our requirements 
however  should we incur a loss that exceeds our coverage  it could negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows 
an inability to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting  as required by the sarbanes oxley act of  could have an adverse impact on our stock price 
our certification that we have sufficient internal controls in place today is no guarantee that we will maintain those controls in the future or that those controls will be effective in ensuring the accuracy of our financial reports 
an inability to maintain effective controls or our receiving an adverse or qualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls from our independent registered public accounting firm could have a negative impact on our stock price 
transaction services segment changes that reduce payer compensation for electronic claims may reduce our revenue and margins 
over the last few years  some payers have reduced their rebate rate paid to companies which process claims  and some have elected to stop offering rebates 
if this trend continues  we will be forced to shift the cost of these claims from the payers to the submitting providers 
if we are not successful in shifting this revenue burden to our submitting providers  our revenue will be reduced 
as electronic transaction processing penetrates the healthcare industry more extensively  we will face increasing pressure to reduce our prices which may cause us to no longer be competitive as a result of potential declining margins 
as electronic transaction processing extensively penetrates the healthcare market and or becomes highly standardized  competition among electronic transaction processors will focus increasingly on pricing 
this competition is putting intense pressure on us to reduce our pricing in order to retain market share 
if we are unable to reduce our costs sufficiently to offset declines in our prices  or if we are unable to introduce new  innovative service offerings with higher margins  our results of operations could decline 
consolidation in the healthcare industry may give our customers greater bargaining power and cause us to reduce our prices 
many healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
as provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate  competition to provide products and services such as those we provide will become more intense and the importance of establishing and maintaining relationships with key industry participants will become greater 
these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
if we are forced to reduce prices  revenues and cash flows could decrease 
our business will suffer if we are unable to successfully integrate future acquired it platforms or if our existing phoenix platform becomes unstable or unable to accommodate our clients requirements 
as we make future acquisitions  our business will be dependent on the successful consolidation of those acquired platforms with our current systems 
if there is significant disruption to our customers  our business or our operations could be harmed 
additionally  if our phoenix platform  the backbone of our transaction processing business  becomes unstable or does not provide satisfactory outcomes to a significant number of clients  our business and our operations will be harmed 
our business and future success may depend on our ability to cross sell our products and services 
our ability to generate revenue and growth partly depends on our ability to cross sell our products and services to our existing customers and new customers resulting from acquisitions 
our ability to successfully cross sell our products and services is one of the most significant factors influencing our growth 
we may not be successful in cross selling our products and services and our failure in this area would likely have an adverse effect on our business 
we depend on electronic connections to insurance companies and other payers  and if we lose these electronic connections  our service offerings would be limited and less desirable to healthcare providers 
our business depends upon a substantial number of payers  such as insurance companies  medicare and medicaid agencies  to which we have electronic connections 
these connections may either be made directly or through a clearinghouse 
we may not be able to maintain our links with all these payers on terms satisfactory to us 
in addition  we cannot assure that we will be able to develop new connections  either directly or through clearinghouses  on satisfactory terms 
lastly  some third party payers provide systems directly to healthcare providers  bypassing us and other third party processors 
our failure to maintain existing connections with payers and clearinghouses or to develop new connections as circumstances warrant  or an increase in the utilization of d irect links between providers and payers  could cause our electronic transaction processing system to be less desirable to healthcare participants  thus slowing down or reducing the number of transactions that we process and for which we are paid 
we have important business relationships with other companies to market and sell some of our clinical and financial products and services 
if these companies terminate their relationships with us  or are less successful in the future  we will need to add this emphasis internally  which may divert our efforts and resources from other projects 
for the marketing and sale of some of our products and services  we entered into important business relationships with physician office management information system vendors  with electronic medical record vendors and with other distribution partners 
these business relationships  which have required and may continue to require significant commitments of effort and resources  are an important part of our distribution strategy and generate substantial recurring revenue 
most of these relationships are on a non exclusive basis 
we may not be able to continue our relationships with our electronic commerce partners and other strategic partners  most of whom have significantly greater financial and marketing resources than we do 
also  our arrangements with some of our partners involve negotiated payments to the partners based on percentages of revenues generated by the partners 
if the payments prove to be too high  we may be unable to realize acceptable margins  but if the payments prove to be too low  the partners may not be motivated to produce a sufficient volume of revenues 
the success of our important business relationships will depend in part upon our partners own competitive  marketing and strategic considerations  including the relative advantages of alternative products being developed and marketed by such partners 
if any such partners are unsuccessful in marketing our products  we will need to place added emphasis on these aspects of our business internally  which may divert our planned efforts and resources from other projects 
a significant amount of the revenues in our transaction services segment is from one customer 
loss of this relationship may adversely affect our profitability 
for the years ended december   and  approximately  and  respectively  of consolidated revenues and  and  respectively  of transaction services revenue were from per se technologies 
the adoption of electronic processing of clinical transactions in the healthcare industry is proceeding slowly  thus  the future of our business could be uncertain and this may have an adverse impact on our operations 
our strategy anticipates that electronic processing of clinical healthcare transactions  including transactions involving prescriptions and laboratory results  will become more widespread and that providers and third party institutions increasingly will use electronic transaction processing networks for the processing and transmission of data 
the rate at which providers adopt the use of electronic transmission of clinical healthcare transactions and  in particular  the use of the internet to transmit them continues to be slow and the continued or accelerated conversion from paper based transaction processing to electronic transaction processing in the healthcare industry  using proprietary healthcare management systems or the internet  may not occur 
an error by us in the process of providing clinical connectivity or transmitting prescription and laboratory data could result in substantial injury to a patient  and our liability insurance may not be adequate in a catastrophic situation  adversely impacting our business or operations 
our business exposes us to potential liability risks that are  unavoidably  part of the healthcare electronic transaction processing industry 
since some of our products and services relate to the prescribing and refilling of drugs and the transmission of medical laboratory results  an error by any party in the process could result in substantial injury to a patient 
as a result  our liability risks are significant 
our insurance may be insufficient to cover potential claims arising out of our current or future operations  and sufficient coverage may not be available in the future at a reasonable cost 
a partially or completely uninsured claim against us  if successful and of sufficient magnitude could have significant adverse financial consequences 
our inability to obtain insurance of the type and in the amounts required could generally impair our ability to market our products and services 
our businesses have many competitors 
we face competition from many healthcare information systems companies and other technology companies 
many of our competitors are significantly larger  have greater financial resources than we do and have established reputations for success in implementing healthcare electronic transaction processing systems 
other companies have targeted this industry for growth  including the development of new technologies utilizing internet based systems 
we may not be able to compete successfully with these companies and these or other competitors may commercialize products  services or technologies that render our products  services or technologies obsolete or less marketable 
our ppo and provider arrangements provide no guarantee of long term relationships 
the majority of our contracts with ppos and providers can be terminated without cause  generally on days notice 
for our transaction services business  the loss of any one provider may not be material  but if large numbers of providers chose to terminate their contracts  our revenues and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
the termination of any ppo contract would render us unable to provide our customers with network access to that ppo  and  therefore  would adversely affect our ability to reprice claims and derive revenues 
furthermore  we rely on our participating ppos and provider groups to ensure participation by their providers 
our ppo contracts generally do not provide us with direct recourse against a participating provi der that chooses not to honor its obligation to provide a discount  or chooses to discontinue its participation in nppn 
termination of provider contracts or other changes in the manner in which these parties conduct their business could negatively affect our ability to provide services to our customers 
some providers have historically been reluctant to participate in secondary networks 
our percentage of savings business model sometimes allows a payer to utilize our network discounts in circumstances where nppn is not the payer s primary network 
in these circumstances  nppn participating providers are not traditionally given the same assurances of patient flow that they receive when they are part of a primary network 
historically  some providers have been reluctant to participate in network arrangements that do not provide a high degree of visibility to patients 
although the steerage provided by our payers as a whole  and the speed and efficiency with which we provide claims repricing services makes nppn affiliation an attractive option for providers  our business model could discourage providers from commencing or maintaining an affi liation with nppn 
payers are requiring ppos to have more direct access to provider networks 
over the past few years  payers have shifted more of their business to ppos that have a higher percentage of direct contracts with their provider network as opposed to using other ppos to access the same provider network 
our inability to directly recruit new providers or our inability to acquire another ppo in order to increase our direct connectivity to providers could harm our ability to sell our ppo access to new payers 
additionally  our existing payers could decide to move their business to another ppo with more direct provider connectivity and our results of operations could decline 
our ppo accounts receivable are subject to adjustment 
we generally record revenue for our services when the services are performed  less amounts reserved for claim reversals and bad debts 
the estimates for claim reversals and bad debts are based on judgment and historical experience 
many of the claims are not fully adjudicated for over days 
although we have not experienced this  to the extent that actual claim reversals and bad debts associated with our business exceed the amounts reserved  such difference could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
laboratory communication services segment our laboratory communication services segment has a high customer concentration 
for the years ended december  and and  approximately  and of consolidated revenues  and  and of laboratory communication segment revenues  respectively were from a single customer for the sale  lease  and service of communication devices 
the potential loss of this customer would materially affect the company s laboratory communication services operating results 
risks related to acquisitions our business will suffer if we fail to successfully integrate the customers  products and technology of companies we acquire into our business 
we have undertaken several acquisitions in the past few years as part of a strategy to expand our business  and we may continue in the future to acquire businesses  assets  services  products and technologies from other persons or entities 
the anticipated efficiencies and other benefits to be derived from future acquisitions may not be realized if we are unable to successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our operations  including customers  personnel  product lines and technology 
we are in the process of integrating the customers  products  and technology of our acquisition of medical resources  llc into our operations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any future acquired businesses into our operations 
integration of acquired business es can be expensive  time consuming and may strain our resources 
integration may divert management s focus and attention from other business concerns and expose us to unforeseen liabilities and risks 
we may also lose key employees  strategic partners and customers as a result of our inability to successfully integrate in a timely manner or as a result of relationships the acquired businesses may have with our competitors or the competitors of our customers and strategic partners 
some challenges we face in successfully integrating future acquired businesses into our operations include conflicts or potential conflicts with customers  suppliers and strategic partners  integration of platforms  product lines  networks and other technology  migration of new customers and products to our existing network  ability to cross sell products and services to our new and existing customer base  retention of key personnel  consolidation of accounting and administrative systems and functions  coordinating new product and process development  increasing the scope  geographic diversity and complexity of operations  difficulties in consolidating facilities and transferring processes and know how  and other difficulties in the assimilation of acquired operations  technologies or products 
businesses we acquire may have undisclosed liabilities or contingent liabilities that are indeterminable and which may have a negative impact on our results of operations and require unanticipated expense 
in pursuing our acquisition strategy  our investigations of the acquisition candidates may fail to discover certain undisclosed liabilities of the acquisition candidates or may determine that certain contingent liabilities are indeterminable 
if we acquire a company having undisclosed liabilities  as a successor owner  we may be responsible for such undisclosed liabilities 
if we acquire a company with liabilities that are indeterminable at the time of the acquisition  we may be required to make subsequent payments that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
furthermore  the introduction of new products and services from acquired companies may have a greater risk of undetected or unknown errors  bugs or liabilities than our historic products 
we may lose customers as a result of acquisitions which may have an adverse impact on our business or operations 
acquisitions may cause disruptions in our business or the business of the acquired company  which could have material adverse effects on our business and operations 
in addition  our customers  licensors and other business partners  in response to an acquisition or merger  may adversely change or terminate their relationships with us  leading to a material adverse effect on us 
certain of our current or potential customers may cancel or defer requests for our services 
in addition  our customers may expect preferential pricing as a result of an acquisition or merger 
an acquisition or merger may also adversely affect our ability to attract new customers and may have an adverse impact on our business or operations 
risks related to our industry government regulation and new legislation may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations 
the healthcare industry is highly regulated and is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal and state healthcare laws 
several state and federal laws  including without limitation  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  govern the collection  dissemination  use and confidentiality of patient healthcare information 
the privacy regulations  in particular  are broad in scope  and will require constant vigilance for ongoing compliance 
we cannot guarantee that we will be in compliance in the future 
hipaa also mandates the use of standard transactions  standard provider identifiers  security requirements and other provisions for electronic healthcare claims transactions 
approximately of our inbound transactions from our provider customers are received in a legacy format and are translated  by us  on behalf of these customers 
our contracts with our customers  strategic partners  providers  payers and other healthcare entities mandate  or will mandate  that our products and services be hipaa compliant 
if our products and services are not in compliance with hipaa or any other alternative guidelines issued by the cms on an ongoing basis  our customers  strategic partners and other healthcare providers with whom we contract may terminate their contracts with us or sue us for breach of contract additionally  our revenues may be reduced as some of our non compliant payer partners may be forced to accept paper based transactions for which we may not be the recipient for processing 
we may be subject to penalties for non compliance by federal and state governments  and patients who believ e that their confidential health information has been misused or improperly disclosed may have certain causes of actions under applicable state privacy or hipaa like laws against us  our partners or customers 
we  and all companies  are responsible for collecting and sending npi numbers in compliance with the federal register mandate by may  we may not be able to maintain compliance with hipaa standards for transaction formats  provider identifiers and security 
any failure to be in compliance could result in regulatory penalties assessed against us  weaken demand for our affected services and may have an adverse impact on our business and operations 
there are a significant number of state initiatives regarding healthcare services 
if we are unable to comply with the standards set by the states in which we operate  we  or our operations  could be harmed 
in our transaction services segment  we contract with multiple ppo networks 
these ppo networks are typically governed by the laws and regulations of the states in which they operate  in addition to federal employee retirement income security act erisa legislation 
over the last few years  a number of states have been actively changing their laws and regulations governing ppos and this trend may continue 
it is difficult to determine when erisa preemption of state ppo law applies 
our failure to comply with existing state laws or any new laws in the future could jeopardize our ability to continue business in the affected states  thereby reducing our revenues 
in addition  compliance with additional regulation could be expensive and negatively imp act our operating results 
we are dependent on the growth of the internet and electronic healthcare information markets 
many of our products and services are geared toward the internet and electronic healthcare information markets 
the perceived difficulty of securely transmitting confidential information has been a significant barrier to conducting e commerce and engaging in sensitive communications over the internet 
our strategy relies  in part  on the use of the internet to transmit confidential information 
any well publicized compromise of internet security may deter providers from using the internet to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential healthcare information and this may result in significantly lower revenues and operating results 
risks related to our technology evolving industry standards and rapid technological changes could result in our products becoming obsolete or no longer in demand 
rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and the frequent introduction of new and enhanced internet based services characterize the market for our products and services 
our success will depend upon our ability to enhance our existing services  introduce new products and services on a timely and cost effective basis to meet evolving customer requirements  achieve market acceptance for new products or services and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
we may not be able to respond effectively to technological changes or new industry standards 
moreover  other companies may develop competitive products or services that may cause our products and services to become obsolete or no longer be in demand 
we depend on uninterrupted computer access for our customers 
any prolonged interruptions in operations could cause customers to seek alternative providers of our services 
our success is dependent on our ability to deliver high quality  uninterrupted computer networking and hosting  requiring us to protect our computer equipment and the information stored on servers against damage by fire  natural disaster  power loss  telecommunications failures  unauthorized intrusion and other catastrophic events 
we operate production networks in our norcross  georgia  santa ana  california  and middletown  new york  facilities 
any damage or failure resulting in prolonged interruptions in our operations could cause our customers to seek alternative providers of our services 
in particular  a system failure  if prolonged  could result in lost revenues  loss of customers and damage to our reputation  any of which could cause our business to materially suffer 
while we carry property and business interruption insurance to cover operations  the coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that may occur 
computer network systems like ours could suffer security and privacy breaches that could harm our customers and us 
we currently operate servers and maintain connectivity from multiple facilities 
our infrastructure may be vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins and similar disruptive problems caused by customers or others 
computer viruses  break ins or other security problems could lead to interruption  delays or cessation in service to our customers 
these problems could also potentially jeopardize the security of confidential information stored in the computer systems of our customers  which may deter potential customers from doing business with us and give rise to possible liability to users whose security or privacy has been infringed 
the security and privacy concerns of existing and potential customers may inhibit the growth of the healthcare information services industry  in general  and our customer base and business  in particular 
a significant security breach could result in loss of customers  loss of revenues  damage to our reputation  direct damages  costs of repair and detection and other unplanned expenses 
while we carry professional liability insurance to cover such breaches  the coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that may occur 
the protection of our intellectual property requires substantial resources 
we rely largely on our own security systems and confidentiality procedures and nondisclosure agreements with employees  customers and certain vendors to maintain the confidentiality and security of our proprietary information  including our trade secrets and internally developed computer applications 
if third parties gain unauthorized access to our information systems  or if anyone misappropriates our proprietary information  this may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
we are in the process of acquiring patent protection for our phoenix technology and other proprietary technology  however  we have not traditionally sought patent protection for our technology 
trade secret laws offer limited protection against third party development of competitive products or services 
because we lack the protection of registered copyrights for our internally developed software and software applications  we may be vulnerable to misappropriation of our proprietary technology by third parties or competitors 
the failure to adequately protect our technology could adversely affect our business 
we may be subject to infringement claims 
as our competitors healthcare information systems increase in complexity and overall capabilities  and the functionality of these systems further overlap  we could be subject to claims that our technology infringes on the proprietary rights of third parties 
these claims  even if without merit  could subject us to costly litigation and could require the resources  time and attention of our technical  legal and management personnel to defend 
the failure to develop non infringing technology or trade names  or the failure to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  could adversely affect our operations and revenues 
if our ability to expand our network infrastructure is constrained  we could lose customers  and that loss could adversely affect our operating results 
we must continue to expand and adapt our network and technology infrastructure to accommodate additional users  increased transaction volumes and changing customer requirements 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the volume of transactions we process  reprice or otherwise service or be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases 
we may be unable to expand or adapt our network infrastructure to meet additional demand or our customers changing needs on a timely basis  at a commercially reasonable cost or at all 
our current information systems  procedures and controls may not continue to support our operations while maintaining acceptable overall performance and may hinder our ability to exploit the market for healthcare applications and services 
service lapses could cause our users to switch to the services of our competitors 
risks related to our stock we may issue additional shares that could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we currently have  shares of authorized but unissued common stock and  shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock 
certain events over which our shareholders have no control could result in the issuance of additional shares of our common stock which would dilute our shareholders ownership percentage in us and could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we may issue additional shares of common stock or preferred stock for many reasons including raising additional capital or financing acquisitions  exercise  conversion  or exchange of outstanding options  warrants and shares of convertible preferred stock  in lieu of cash payment of dividends  or our articles of incorporation  as amended  authorize the issuance of up to  shares of common stock and  shares of blank check preferred stock with such designations  rights and preferences as may be determined from time to time by our board of directors 
pursuant to our articles of incorporation  as amended  we may issue shares of our common and preferred stock in the future that will dilute our existing shareholders without prior notice or approval of our shareholders 
additionally  our board of directors does not intend to solicit further approval from our shareholders prior to designating the rights  preferences or privileges of any such preferred stock  including  without limitation  rights as to dividends  conversion  voting  liquidation preference or redemption  which in each case may be superior to the rights of our common stock 
the rights of the holders of any of our common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that m ay be issued in the future 
the issuance of our preferred stock could have the effect of discouraging  delaying or preventing a change of control and preventing holders of our common stock from realizing a premium on their shares 
the trading price of our common stock may be volatile 
the stock market  including the nasdaq stock market  on which the shares of our common stock are listed  has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies 
the market price of our common stock  as with many emerging healthcare and technology companies  is likely to be volatile and could continue to be susceptible to wide price fluctuations due to a number of internal and external factors  many of which are beyond our control  including quarterly variations in operating results and overall financial condition  economic and political developments affecting the economy as a whole  our largest holder liquidating their position would likely serve to compress our share price  short selling programs  the stock market s perception of the healthcare technology industry as a whole  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  additions or departures of key personnel  and sales of substantial numbers of shares of our common stock  or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock 
we do not plan on declaring or paying dividends on our common stock 
we have never declared or paid a dividend on our common stock  nor do we have any plans to do so in the future

item legal proceedings we were named as a defendant in an action filed in december  in the eastern district of wisconsin by metavante corporation  metavante 
metavante claimed that our use of the name medavant and the logo in connection with healthcare transaction processing infringed trademark rights allegedly held by metavante 
metavante sought unspecified compensatory damages and injunctive relief 
the district court issued a decision and order denying metavante s motion for a preliminary injunction 
on october   metavante corporation and medavant entered into a settlement and release agreement  the terms of which did not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
we were named as a defendant in an action filed in july  in the united states district court of new jersey by medavante  inc  medavante 
medavante claimed that our use of the names medavant and medavant healthcare solutions infringed trademark rights allegedly held by medavante 
medavante sought unspecified compensatory damages and injunctive relief 
on february   the district court issued a settlement order 
the specific terms of the proposed settlement and release agreement are currently being negotiated  but the total value of the settlement is expected to be approximately million  of which million will be covered by insurance proceeds 
the company has accrued a preliminary estimate of milli on net of expected insurance proceeds based upon these negotiations

our md a is organized as follows business description key indicators of financial condition industry trends and financial strategies application of critical accounting policies and estimates results of operations liquidity  capital resources and financial position accounting matters forward looking statements business description medavant is an information technology company that facilitates the exchange of medical claim information among doctors  hospitals  medical laboratories  pharmacies  and insurance payers 
medavant also enables the electronic transmission of laboratory results and prescription orders 
with medavant  the transactions are secure  faster  more accurate  and more economical 
we operate two separately managed reportable segments transaction services and laboratory communications 
a description of these segments  their primary services and our source of revenue  in each  are transaction services processing claims 
the primary tool our customers use to process claims is a real time web portal called mymedavant  powered by our phoenix platform 
it offers standard and premium services with features such as verifying a patient s insurance  enrolling with payers  tracking a claim s progress with the payer and retrieving reports from payers 
on average  we processed approximately million revenue related transactions a day in providers pay for claims processing based on either a flat monthly fee or a per transaction fee 
operating a ppo 
our ppo is called the national preferred provider network nppn tm or nppn and is accessed by more than seven million patients   physicians   acute care facilities and  ancillary care providers 
we generate revenue primarily by charging participating payers a percentage of the savings they receive through nppn 
because we operate a ppo  we can offer payers discounts on claims when a patient uses an out of network provider and we can negotiate non discounted claims for payers 
providing electronic prescription management 
medavant s prescribe tm is a desktop and online application providers use to send new prescriptions and refill requests to more than  pharmacies across the nation 
providers pay a flat fee monthly  and pharmacy partners pay either a flat monthly fee or a per transaction fee based on transaction types 
laboratory communications printing technology 
our intelligent printing technology is integrated into printers for labs to purchase and install in physician offices 
this allows for the secure transmittal of laboratory reports 
laboratories also purchase support  maintenance and monitoring programs to manage printers that have our integrated technology 
pilot 
this patent pending  web enabled device sits in a provider s office and is used to transfer lab reports in virtually any format to a printer  a personal computer or a hand held device 
it integrates with most practice management systems and usually saves the provider the cost of a dedicated phone line 
labs either purchase pilot devices with an annual support program or they subscribe to pilot with a program that includes support services 
fleet management system  fms 
labs use this online tool to monitor printers in provider offices and receive alerts for routine problems such as a printer being out of paper or having a paper jam 
fms can also be used to monitor printer inventory and schedule regular maintenance 
labs pay a monthly fee per printer to use fms 
key indicators of financial condition in the fall of  the current management team began improving efficiencies by reducing staff  renegotiating vendor contracts  eliminating unprofitable non core products  and closing smaller offices 
the drive for efficiency continued through and consequently  gross profit is a key indicator of our financial condition 
by focusing in on achieving greater efficiencies and building the foundation for future opportunities and strategies  medavant was able to see significant improvement in its gross profit 
to that end  we hit an important technology milestone in by moving all transactions to the phoenix platform and setting the stage for greater operating margins now and in the future 
because of its scalability  we can easily multiply our current transaction volume without many additional resources 
additionally  by storing all our data in one repository  we can continue to streamline operations and explore new opportunities because we access data with more efficiency and greater speed 
see the advanced technology under industry trends below for more details on how our technology affects our financial condition 
in an effort to create additional cost savings opportunities  we outsourced many of our ppo operations to ppoone  a fiserv company 
this agreement  announced in november  is expected to improve operational efficiencies and generate an estimated annual savings in excess of  by reducing our selling  general and administrative expenses 
these savings will be partially offset by a smaller direct cost during and forward 
we also unveiled our premium revenue cycle management service in october providers pay an additional fee for the premium service  however  it will be before the revenue it generates is evident in our consolidated financial statements 
see liquidity  capital resources and financial position for a discussion of our going concern opinion and management s plan to address such issues 
industry trends and financial strategies we have identified the following trends in the healthcare industry and outlined our financial strategy in each acquisitions advanced technology reduced payments to providers shifting responsibility for medical care increasing demand for data and analytics acquisitions the most observable trend in healthcare is the consolidation of technology companies and payers 
in  for example  the carlyle group acquired multiplan and phcs 
mckesson announced their intention to acquire per se 
per se purchased ndc health the previous year 
unitedhealth group purchased other smaller plans  including pacificare and oxford 
our strategy in this forum is to explore opportunities for acquiring assets  products or services 
we have acquired three companies in the past five years 
they include on march   we acquired planvista  a company that provided ppo and business process outsourcing solutions for the medical insurance and managed care industries  as well as services for healthcare providers 
we acquired planvista for  shares of our common stock issued to planvista shareholders valued at million based on the average closing price of our common stock for the day of and the two days before and after december   the date of the announcement of the definitive agreement 
we also assumed debt and other liabilities of planvista totaling million and we paid million in acquisition related costs 
additionally  we raised million in a private placement sale of  shares of our common stock to investment e ntities affiliated with general atlantic llc  commonwealth associates and other parties to partially fund repayment of certain of planvista s debts and other obligations outstanding at the time of the acquisition 
on february   we acquired substantially all the assets and operations of zeneks  inc  zeneks  a privately held company based in tampa  florida  for  plus assumed liabilities 
zeneks was incorporated in and was established to contain medical costs for payers 
on october   we acquired substantially all the assets and operations of medical resources  llc  and national provider network  inc mrl  for million in total consideration 
the purchase price was comprised of million in cash  funded by medavant s current credit facility  and a million note payable that bears interest at percent per annum 
the note matures in two years and is payable in equal monthly installments of principal and interest 
the planvista acquisition made us the only entity in healthcare that offers nationwide claims processing and a nationwide ppo 
this means we can help our customers with any part of the insurance claim cycle 
we refer to this as gateway solutions  and it allows payers to use one part of the full  integrated suite of services or choose a combination of services to address their needs 
the zeneks acquisition complemented our services to payers by incorporating bill negotiation services for claims when a patient uses out of network providers 
the mrl acquisition gave nppn more direct contracts with providers and additional contract providers in six states 
advanced technology our customers increasingly expect technology to address their business issues and healthcare companies are responding with more advanced solutions 
we believe we are leaders in this arena with our phoenix transaction processing platform 
we created phoenix more than five years ago with multiple processing engines that can be monitored and programmed throughout all areas of our business 
it handles real time transactions which generate results in seconds  as well as the more traditional batch transactions for providers and payers who are not ready for real time 
most of our competition still uses multiple processing systems that can only handle batch transactions 
between and  we acquired nine companies  each with its own technology systems 
in  we began moving all transactions to phoenix and completed this migration by early phoenix currently operates at less than percent of capacity  meaning we are in a position to increase the scale of new business without the added expense of building out our technology 
using phoenix for all our transactions also means data can be more easily accessed  collected and analyzed as it is in a single repository 
in addition to maximizing the benefits of phoenix  our financial strategy in technology is to add value to our existing products while adding new solutions to our offerings 
some examples include the feature story in the january  issue of health data management quotes tom walsh  an independent health care consultant as saying  health care is way behind when it comes to disaster recovery 
in contrast in  we completed the build out of a second data center in richardson  texas  to enable real time data replication with our data center in atlanta  georgia 
providers want medical laboratory results to be automatically merged with their patient s electronic medical records emr rather than having to manually transfer information from a lab report 
in march  we announced that our pilot device was being used to bridge laboratory report data to a resident emr application 
the november   issue of usa today said fraud is estimated to account for to of the nation s trillion health care spending tab 
several companies have launched fraud detection software to mine claim data for suspicious patterns 
we are exploring the potential for launching a fraud detection component of our claims processing in our ppo customers requested a website dedicated to nppn  as a result we created and launched www 
nppn 
com within three weeks of identifying this need 
this website assists patients in finding an nppn provider  lets providers sign up for nppn online and allows payers to request data to validate savings they could receive via nppn 
our technology staff devoted much of their time in to transitioning our transactions to phoenix and the back up data center 
we will continue to concentrate on new endeavors to meet the consumers demand for technical solutions 
reduced payments to providers in an annual survey of fee schedules  physicians practice journal found that the average physician reimbursement from commercial payers and medicare fell in  with payment levels averaging below those of and below those of the article attributed this decline to consolidation in the insurance industry because the dwindling number of payers means providers lose leverage in negotiations 
a plan to cut medicare payments in was deterred by congress  however rate cuts may take effect in in the next eight years  medicare physician payments are slated to be cut by approximately percent  while practice costs increase nearly percent  according to the american medical association 
we address these trends by offering tools for providers to manage their revenue cycle saving them time and money 
real time services on our web portal  mymedavant  allow providers to verify a patient s insurance eligibility  inquire about a claim s status at the payer  request referrals to other providers and inquire about referral status 
knowing that information up front allows providers to avoid delays in their revenue cycles 
in october  we introduced a premium service on mymedavant which gives providers more advanced tools to manage their businesses 
using premium service  providers can correct and resubmit rejected claims online  create letters to appeal decisions from payers  automatically run reports to identify issues before they cause revenue problems and manage their office workflow 
premium services are more expensive than our standard services  but providers can recoup these costs by reducing the time their staff spends managing data 
we created an online calculator to demonstrate to providers how automating their business functions could save both time and money 
giving providers a choice of services is part of our strategy 
in addition to choosing between standard or premium services for claim submission and processing  providers can choose between a payment plan with a flat monthly fee or a per transaction fee 
shifting responsibility for medical care consumer driven healthcare is an unknown player in today s healthcare environment 
if widely accepted  it will change the relationship between payers and providers 
if high deductible health plans become common  at the point of service the provider will need to know whether the patient has met their deductible  otherwise the doctor may incur credit risk by billing the patient later 
consequently  some payers are developing real time adjudication programs which will let the provider know immediately how much the payer will pay for the provider s services rendered 
we believe it will be some time before payers offer that service in real time  however  should it become a reality  there will be less need for the claims processing portion of our business 
our strategy  in light of this  is to add new products to differentiate ourselves based on the quality of our product 
by automating revenue cycle processes that would not be included in a payer s real time adjudication program  we can drive the transaction economics that are critical to our customers success  thereby improving gross margin and operating income 
increased demand for data and analytics our customers reactions to the premium services on mymedavant indicate that there is at least as great  if not greater  value in the business intelligence we provide related to the transactions we process as there is in the process itself 
we believe that providing actionable data and related products and services is an untapped  yet desirable  demand that we believe we can meet 
more of our resources will be focused on leveraging this area in application of critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  but we believe that any variation in results would not have a material effect on our financial condition 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements beginning on page f revenue recognition revenue is derived from our transaction services and laboratory communication solutions segments 
our transaction services segment provides transaction and value added services principally between healthcare providers  insurance companies  physicians and pharmacies 
such transactions and services include electronic claims submission and reporting  insurance eligibility verification  claims status inquiries  referral management  electronic remittance advice  patient statement processing  encounters and cost savings services for payers including claims repricing and bill negotiation 
through our laboratory communication solutions segment  we sell  rent and service intelligent remote reporting devices and provide lab results reporting through our software products 
transaction services revenues are derived from insurance payers  pharmacies and submitters physicians and other entities including billing services  practice management software vendors and claims aggregators 
such revenues are recorded on either a per transaction fee basis or on a flat fee basis per physician  per tax id  etc 
and are recognized in the period in which the service is rendered 
agreements with payers or pharmacies span one to three years on a non exclusive basis 
agreements with submitters have one year terms  renew automatically and are generally terminable thereafter upon to days notice 
transaction fees vary according to the type of transaction and other factors  including volume level commitments 
revenue from operating a ppo in our transaction services segment is recognized when the services are performed and are recorded net of their estimated allowance 
these revenues are primarily in the form of fees generated from the discounts we secure for the payers that access our provider network 
we enter into agreements with healthcare payer customers that require them to pay a percentage of the cost savings generated from our network discounts with participating providers 
these agreements are generally terminable upon days notice 
revenue from a percentage of savings contract is generally recognized when the related claims processing and administrative services have been performed 
the remainder of the revenue from our ppo business is recognized monthly from customers that pay a monthly fee based on eligible employees enrolled in a benefit plan covered by our health benefits payers clients 
also  in our transaction services segment  certain transaction fee revenue is subject to revenue sharing pursuant to agreements with resellers  vendors or gateway partners and is recorded as gross revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
such revenue sharing amounts are based on a per transaction amount or a percentage of revenue basis and may involve increasing amounts or percentages based on transaction or revenue volumes achieved 
revenue from certain up front fees charged primarily for the development of electronic transactions for payers and the implementation of services for submitters in our transaction services segment is amortized ratably over three years  which is the expected life of customer agreements in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition sab no 

revenue from support and maintenance contracts on our products in both our transaction services and laboratory communication solutions segments is recognized ratably over the contract period  which does not exceed one year 
such amounts are billed in advance and established as deferred revenue 
in our laboratory communication solutions segment  revenue from sales of inventory and manufactured goods is recognized in accordance with sab no 
revenues from maintenance fees on laboratory communication devices are charged on an annual or quarterly basis and are recognized ratably over the service period 
service fees may also be charged on a per event basis and are recognized after the service has been performed 
revenue from the rental of laboratory communication devices is recognized ratably over the applicable period of the rental contract 
such contracts require monthly rental payments and have terms of one to three years  then renewing to a month to month period after the initial term is expired 
contracts may be cancelled upon days notice 
a significant amount of rental revenues are derived from contracts that are no longer under the initial non cancelable term 
at the end of the rental period  the customer may return or purchase the unit at fair market value 
upon sale of the revenue earning equipment  the gross proceeds are included in net revenues and the undepreciated cost of the equipment sold is included in cost of sales 
goodwill the company has adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  under sfas no 
 goodwill must be reviewed at least annually for impairment and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level at adoption and at least annually thereafter  utilizing a fair value methodology 
we completed our most recent annual test as of december  the december   analysis utilized cash flow based market comparables in assessing fair value for our goodwill impairment testing and we concluded that there was no impairment of our goodwill 
to the extent that future cash flows differ from those projected in our analysis  fair value of our goodwill may be affected and may result in an impairment charge 
capitalized software development and research and development costs incurred internally and fees paid to outside contractors and consultants during the application development stage of our internally used software products are capitalized 
costs of upgrades and major enhancements that result in additional functionality are also capitalized 
costs incurred for maintenance and minor upgrades are expensed as incurred 
all other costs are expensed as incurred as research and development expenses and are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
application development stage costs generally include software configuration  coding  installation of hardware and testing 
once the project is completed  capitalized costs are amortized over their remaining estimated economic life 
our judgment is used in determining whether costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
we periodically review projected cash flows and other criteria in assessing the impairment of any internal use capitalized software and take impairment charges as needed 
purchased technology and other intangibles assets purchased technology and other intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives of to years 
the carrying values of purchased technology and intangible assets are reviewed if the facts and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired 
this review indicates whether assets will be recoverable based on future expected cash flows and  if not recoverable  whether there is an impairment of such assets 
reserve for doubtful accounts revenue allowances bad debt estimates we rely on estimates to determine revenue allowances  bad debt expense and the adequacy of the reserve for doubtful accounts receivable 
these estimates are based on our historical experience and the industry in which we operate 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
additionally  in our ppo business  we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record a specific res erve for bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected

the following narrative is a further explanation of our sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents 
during the years ended december  and  net cash used in provided by operating activities totaled million and million  respectively 
the significant decrease in cash provided by operations for is due to the pay down of accounts payable and accrued expenses primarily in the first quarter of precipitated by our refinancing with laurus 
the general decline in cash from operations is due to the decline in our revenues over the past two years that is partially offset by reductions in operating expenses 
management will continue to concentrate its efforts on improving revenue with higher than historical margins and drive efficiencies through further reductions in operating expenses 
cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and  totaled million and million  respectively 
the amounts relate primarily to the acquisitions of zeneks and mrl million 
the and amounts also consisted of the funding of capital expenditures for our technical infrastructure  administrative systems and capitalization of internally developed software of million and million  respectively

cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december   totaled million and cash used in financing activities for the year ended december   totaled million 
the amounts consist primarily of our net repayments of notes payable and lines of credit million  and net debt issuance cost million related to our december laurus refinancing 
the amounts consisted primarily of net repayment of notes payable and line of credit  other long term debt and capital leases million 
additionally  we incurred approximately million for debt issuance costs 
these were partially offset by million of proceeds from the sale of our common stock to our chief executive officer during the second quarter of and borrowings on our lines of credit and notes payable 
on december   we entered into a loan transaction with laurus pursuant to which laurus extended million in financing to us in the form of a million secured term loan and a million secured revolving credit facility 
the loan was used to repay our then existing senior loan facility with wachovia bank  na the term loan has a stated term of five years and will accrue interest at prime plus  subject to a minimum interest rate of 
the term loan is payable in equal monthly principal installments of approximately  plus interest until the maturity date of december  the revolving credit facility has a stated term of three years  with two one year options  and will accrue interest at the day libor rate plus  sub ject to a minimum interest rate of  and has a maturity date of december  in connection with the loan agreement  we issued  shares of our common stock to laurus 
we also granted laurus a first priority security interest in substantially all of our present and future tangible and intangible assets including all intellectual property to secure our obligations under the loan agreement 
the loan agreement with laurus contains various customary representation and warranties by us  as well as customary affirmative and negative covenants  including  without limitation  limitations on property liens  maintaining specific forms of accounting and record maintenance and limiting the incurrence of additional debt 
the loan agreement does not contain restrictive covenants regarding minimum earning requirements  historical earning levels  fixed charge coverage or working capital requirements 
the loan agreement also contains certain customary events of default  including  among others  non payment of principal and interest  violation of covenants and in the event we are involved in certain insolvency proceedings 
upon the occurrence of an event of defa ult  laurus is entitled to  among other things  accelerate all of our obligations under the loans 
in the event laurus accelerates the loans  the amount due will include all accrued interest plus of the then outstanding principal amount of the loans being accelerated  as well as all unpaid fees and expenses of laurus 
in addition  if the revolving credit facility is terminated for any reason  whether because of a prepayment or acceleration  we are required to pay an additional premium of up to of the total amount of the revolving credit facility 
in the event we elect to prepay the term loan  the amount due shall be the accrued interest plus of the then outstanding principal amount of the term loan 
we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million as of december   compared to million at december  the drop in cash is specifically related to efforts to minimize our interest charges as cash is swept daily to pay down the line of credit 
in  medavant replaced its senior management team 
due to the significant losses over the prior few years  and due to the default on our senior debt facility in  the new management team initiated a cost reduction plan that included a reduction in force of approximately employees  a closure of certain offices  elimination of non core or under performing product lines  the renegotiation of certain of our vendor contracts and initiated a pay for performance plan for all employees 
additionally  we initiated a plan to move all of our operating systems to phoenix which was completed in early we have also seen a further reduction in our workforce of approximately employees in as we have experienced operating efficiencies due to our recent efforts noted above 
in late  we also announced our intent to move our ppo processing platform to a third party outsourcing company  which we expect will further improve our operating results beginning in during  we acquired zeneks and mrl as part of our focus of improving our product offerings and increasing our direct relationships with our ppo providers 
both of these acquisitions improved our ppo margins by increasing revenue and reducing direct costs 
we currently do not have any material commitments for any capital expenditures  however  we have budgeted approximately million for capital expenditures for the following table represents our contractual cash obligations due over the next several years as of december  operating leases are shown net of any sublease agreements

the balance of the revolving credit facility on february   is approximately million 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources  as defined under the rules of sec release no 
fr the company s independent registered public accounting firm has issued a going concern opinion with respect to the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  specifically  the independent public accountants have stated that because the company has  among other factors  experienced recurring losses from operations and limited access to additional capital they have substantial doubts about its ability to continue as a going concern 
we believe that if we are not successful in increasing revenues  reducing costs  or obtaining additional financing  such inability may adversely impact our ability to successfully execute our business plan and may put us at a competitive disadvantage 
the company is continuing its efforts to reduce costs and increase revenue through its new product launches and expanded relationships with certain custo mers 
however  if these efforts are not successful or if we cannot raise additional capital  we may have to suspend or cease operations  or significantly dilute our stockholders equity holdings
