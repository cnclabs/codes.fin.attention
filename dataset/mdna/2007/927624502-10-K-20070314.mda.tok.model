item business general we are a development stage pharmaceutical company engaged in the development of products for the treatment of cancer 
we were incorporated in march as a delaware corporation and began operations on may  for the years ended december   and  we spent million  million and million  respectively  on research  development and clinical activities 
our portfolio of product candidates consists of two distinct small molecule anticancer agents in clinical development  and additional small molecules in preclinical development 
we also have developed a drug delivery technology for the treatment of cancer 
preclinical development or preclinical studies indicate that the product candidates selected for development are being evaluated for potency  specificity  manufacturability and pharmacologic activity in vitro  or cell culture  and in vivo  or animal models 
typically  clinical evaluation involves a three phase process 
in phase i  clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the tolerated drug dose  early safety profile  proper scheduling and the pattern of drug distribution  absorption and metabolism 
in phase ii  clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine efficacy  dose response relationships and expanded evidence of safety 
in phase iii  large scale  multi center  controlled clinical trials are conducted in order to

our product development programs are based on technologies that we license from yale university yale and other cancer research centers 
we have largely engaged in product development with respect to anticancer therapeutics through in house preclinical and clinical development and through collaboration with academic  research and governmental institutions 
as our product candidates advance through trials  depending on financial and pharmaceutical market conditions and required resources  we will determine the best method and or partnership to develop  and eventually market  our products 

table of contents products in clinical development our lead product candidate  cloretazine vnpm  is an alkylating dna damaging agent 
our primary registration strategy for this compound is for the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia aml 
cloretazine vnpm has received two fast track designations from the us food and drug administration fda for the treatment of i relapsed aml and ii elderly poor risk aml 
cloretazine vnpm has also received orphan drug designation for the treatment of aml in the united states and the european union 
a phase iii trial of cloretazine vnpm in combination with cytosine arabinoside ara c in relapsed aml commenced in march  and we reached the midpoint for patient accrual to this clinical trial patients in november the phase iii trial is designed to accrue patients in total if it continues to full accrual 
the planned interim evaluation of safety and efficacy for this trial based on patients by its data safety monitoring board dsmb is presently anticipated to occur in the second quarter of based on the evaluation of the first patients accrued in the phase iii trial  the dsmb will determine whether to allow the trial to continue as currently d esigned  whether the trial design should be modified  or whether the trial should be terminated completely 
there can be no assurance as to the results of the evaluation of these patients or the timing of completion of this evaluation and there should be no inference that the trial has achieved positive results to date or that the dsmb will allow the phase iii trial to continue 
in may  we commenced a pivotal phase ii trial of cloretazine vnpm in previously untreated elderly patients with de novo poor risk aml 
the trial is designed to continue to the total accrual of patients if there have been at least nine responses in the first patients 
on january   we announced that at least nine responses had been recorded in this trial  and accordingly  that we would proceed to the second stage of accrual 
in addition to these two trials in aml  cloretazine vnpm is being evaluated in a phase ii clinical trial as a single agent in small cell lung cancer 
our second product candidate in clinical trials  triapine  is a small molecule that in preclinical models inhibits the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase  and therefore prevents the replication of tumor cells by blocking a critical step in dna synthesis 
intravenous triapine is being evaluated in clinical trials sponsored by the national cancer institute nci 
the nci also commenced a phase i clinical trial of an oral formulation of triapine in december products in preclinical development vnp is an additional cytotoxic cell damaging compound 
vnp has been demonstrated in preclinical studies to be highly selective for hypoxic poorly oxygenated cells which are found in tumors and are often hard to treat with conventional anticancer agents 
in the third quarter of  we initiated additional preclinical studies on vnp that were requested by the fda after we submitted an investigational new drug ind application for this product in june we plan to resubmit the ind for vnp with the new information by the end of hydrazones are anticancer compounds that have demonstrated potent anti tumor effects in preclinical studies 
the mechanisms of action for these compounds are unidentified at this time but appear to be unlike any known commercially available anticancer agents 
in september  we entered into an exclusive license for these compounds 
we continued to evaluate these compounds in preclinical studies in drug delivery technology tapet tumor amplified protein expression therapy  our drug delivery system using modified salmonella bacteria  is designed to deliver anticancer agents directly to solid tumors 
in  we will continue to seek a development partner for tapet 
overview of cancer and treatment methods cancer is the second leading cause of death in the united states  exceeded only by heart disease 
the american cancer society estimates that in about million new cancer cases are expected to be diagnosed and  cancer deaths are expected to occur in the united states 

table of contents cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell division and growth resulting in the development of a mass of cells or tumor  as well as the invasion and spreading of these cells to other organs of the body metastasis 
cancerous tumors can arise in any tissue or organ within the human body and generally cause clinical problems to the patient when the tumor affects the function of that organ or when the tumor spreads to other organs 
cancers which arise in the bone marrow eg acute and chronic leukemias and multiple myeloma or the lymph nodes hodgkin s disease and lymphomas spread through the bone marrow and lymphatic systems  affecting the growth of normal blood and lymphatic cells 
canc er is believed to occur as a result of a number of factors  such as genetic predisposition  chemical agents  viruses and radiation 
these factors result in genetic changes affecting the ability of cells to regulate their growth and differentiation 
the most common methods of treating patients with cancer are surgery  radiation and anticancer drugs chemotherapy 
a cancer patient often receives treatment with a combination of methods 
surgery and radiation therapy are particularly effective in patients where the disease is localized 
the most common method of treating patients with cancer that has spread beyond the primary site is to administer systemic chemotherapy 
chemotherapy seeks to damage and kill cancer cells or to interfere with the molecular and cellular processes that control the development  growth and survival of malignant tumor cells 
in many cases  chemotherapy consists of the administration of several different drugs in combination 
chemotherapy can cause a n umber of side effects in patients  including weakness  low blood count  loss of appetite  nausea and vomiting  and damage to various organs that can result in loss of normal body functions 
the effectiveness of current cancer treatments with respect to any particular patient varies greatly  depending upon the cancer diagnosis and the tolerance of the individual patient to treatment 
therefore  a significant need exists for new agents that can be used alone or in combination with existing drugs and treatment approaches and that will produce greater efficacy and less toxicity than current therapeutic options 
our product development programs we are developing several potential products for the treatment of cancer 
two of our small molecule anticancer agents are in human clinical trials  and additional small molecules are in preclinical development 
in addition  we are seeking a partner to develop a drug delivery technology 
the discussion below sets forth the development status of our product candidates except as otherwise specifically noted below as of december  products in clinical development cloretazine vnpm cloretazine vnpm is a novel alkylating agent 
alkylating agents directly damage dna to prevent cancer cells from reproducing  and work in all phases of the cell cycle  affecting both dividing and non dividing cancer cells 
alkylating agents are among the most widely used class of anticancer drugs  displaying activity across a range of both hematologic and solid tumors  including acute and chronic leukemias  non hodgkin s lymphoma  hodgkin s disease  multiple myeloma  and lung  breast  ovarian  brain  and certain other cancers 
there are a number of approved alkylating agents used in the treatment of cancer  including busulfan  cisplatin  carboplatin  chlorambucil  cyclophosphamide  ifosfamide  dacarbazine  mechlorethamine  melphalan  and temozolomide 
several of these drugs are known to be among the most effective agents in the treatment of cancer 
preclinical data on cloretazine vnpm showed broad anti tumor activity in in vivo models 
it was curative in certain preclinical leukemia models  including mice bearing certain derivatives of a leukemia cell line that was resistant to standard alkylating agents 
cloretazine vnpm was also active against solid tumor models  including lung  colon  and brain cancer  and melanoma 
the drug was also not affected by mechanisms for multiple drug resistance which can limit 
table of contents the effectiveness of current therapies 
cloretazine vnpm has been shown in preclinical studies to be capable of crossing the blood brain barrier 
the blood brain barrier has been a common obstacle in achieving active concentrations of many anticancer drugs within the brain 
based on early indications of activity in the preclinical studies and completed clinical trials conducted to date  our primary registration strategy for cloretazine vnpm is for the treatment of aml  but we also have evaluated it in solid tumors 
below is a table with a list of all completed  closed and ongoing cloretazine vnpm clinical trials

as with all drug development  we would need to reevaluate cloretazine vnpm if it does not test favorably in any of the clinical trials listed above and either alter the drug or dose  or abandon the drug development project 
in any such event  our business  operations  and prospects would be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  in such circumstances  we would not be able to obtain regulatory approval on a timely basis  if ever 
see item a 
risk factors we do not have products approved for sale 
all of our proposed products are in trials 
if our drug trials are delayed or achieve unfavorable results  we might not be able to obtain regulatory approva ls for our product 
in march  we received fast track designation from the fda for cloretazine vnpm in relapsed or refractory aml 
in october  we received fast track designation for cloretazine vnpm in elderly poor risk aml 
the fda s fast track programs are designed to facilitate the development of new drugs that are intended to treat serious or life threatening conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs 
although fast track status may expedite development and fda review of an application  there can be no assurance that cloretazine vnpm will be reviewed more expeditiously for its fast track indications than would otherwise have been the case or will be approved promptly  or at all 
in october  we received orphan drug designation from the fda for cloretazine vnpm in aml in the united states 
orphan drug designation may be granted to products that treat rare diseases or conditions that affect fewer than  people in the united states 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage or shorten the duration of the fda review and approval process 
the designation may provide eligibility for i a seven year period of market 
table of contents exclusivity for the indication of aml  ii potential tax credits for research  iii grant funding for research and development  iv reduced filing fees for marketing applications  and v assistance with the review of clinical trial protocols 
in january  we received orphan drug designation from the european medicines agency emea for cloretazine vnpm in aml in the european union 
orphan drug status is granted by the european commission to promote development of drugs to treat rare diseases or conditions 
orphan drug designation in europe does not convey any advantage or shorten the duration of the emea review and approval process 
orphan drug designation in europe may entitle cloretazine vnpm to i ten year period of market exclusivity for the indication of aml  ii protocol assistance from the emea to optimize drug development in preparing a dossier that wil l meet regulatory requirements  iii reduced fees associated with applying for market approval  and iv access to european union research funding 
cloretazine vnpm in hematologic malignancies our phase iii trial of cloretazine vnpm in combination with ara c in relapsed aml referenced in the table above is being conducted in over clinical sites in north america and europe 
in february  we reached agreement with the fda for this trial on a special protocol assessment spa  a procedure by which the fda provides official evaluation and guidance on proposed protocols for pivotal phase iii clinical trials 
the trial started in march and is ongoing 
the trial is designed to accrue patients in total if it continues to full accrual 
we reached the midpoint for patient accrual to this trial patients in november the planned interim evaluation of s afety and efficacy for this trial based on patients by its dsmb is presently anticipated to occur in the second quarter of based on the evaluation of the first patients accrued in the phase iii trial  the dsmb will determine whether to allow the trial to continue as currently designed  whether the trial design should be modified  or whether the trial should be terminated completely 
there can be no assurance as to the results of the evaluation of these patients or the timing of completion of this evaluation and there should be no inference that the trial has achieved positive results to date or that the dsmb will allow the phase iii trial to continue 
in may  we commenced a pivotal phase ii trial of cloretazine vnpm vnpm in previously untreated elderly patients with de novo poor risk aml 
elderly de novo poor risk aml patients are those elderly patients whose poor risk aml has not evolved from a prior myelodysplastic syndrome or from prior treatment with chemotherapy 
the trial is designed to continue to the total accrual of patients if there have been at least nine responses in the first patients 
on january   we announced that at least nine responses had been recorded in this t rial  and accordingly  that we would proceed to the second stage of accrual 
cloretazine vnpm in solid tumors our phase ii trial of cloretazine vnpm as a single agent in small cell lung cancer referenced in the table above started in september and is ongoing 
preliminary data from this trial was presented at two conferences in data were presented on a total of evaluable patients i patients in the sensitive relapsed arm and ii patients in the refractory arm 
patients on the trial initially received mg m of cloretazine vnpm weekly for three weeks  every six weeks 
this dose was later reduced by protocol amendment to mg m weekly for three weeks every six weeks due to significant thrombocytopenia at the initial dose level 
of the evaluable patients on the sensitive relapsed arm  there were five patients with partial response and one patient awaiting confirmation of response overall  a response rate  and two patients had stable disease 
of those patients with refractory disease treated with cloretazine vnpm  patient achieved a partial response and patients demonstrated stable disease 
grade and thrombocytopenia was reported as the most serious toxicity observed  and delayed additional treatment in several patients 
early results suggested that the reduced dose of cloretazine vnpm causes less thrombocytopenia no grade or thromobocytopenia in the first four patients at this dose but maintained disease activity 

table of contents the trial was designed as a two stage trial 
both arms of the trial met the criteria for advancement to the second stage and continue to accrue patients 
if both arms complete full accrual  there will be a total of patients on the sensitive relapsed arm and patients on the refractory arm of the trial 
triapine triapine inhibits the enzyme ribonucleotide reductase in preclinical models 
ribonucleotide reductase inhibition is thought to arrest the growth of  or kill  cancer cell lines  by blocking a critical step in dna synthesis in cancer cells 
inhibition of this enzyme has also been shown in vitro and in vivo to enhance the anti tumor activity of several standard anticancer agents 
accordingly  triapine has potential to be used as a single agent  ie  by itself  and in combination with anticancer drugs to prevent damaged antican cer cells from regenerating 
we have evaluated an intravenous formulation of triapine in five single agent phase i trials  three single agent phase ii trials  four phase i combination trials  and two phase ii combination trials 
at this time  we are not sponsoring any additional trials of the intravenous formulation of triapine 
in november  we announced that the nci s division of cancer treatment and diagnosis had approved a collaboration for the clinical development of triapine 
as part of this collaboration  the nci s cancer therapy evaluation program has sponsored clinical trials of triapine to further explore its activity as a single agent or in combination with other agents in patients with cancer 
we provide the product used in these trials 
in early  we announced that a clinical trials agreement had been executed with the nci and in january  the first trial opened under nci sponsorship 
an intravenous formulation of triapine is being evaluated in trials sponsored by the nci 
there are currently five trials underway i two trials of triapine in combination with gemcitabine  ii two trials of triapine in combination with radiation  and iii a trial of triapine in combination with fludarabine 
an additional eleven trials are closed to accrual or completed 
clinical testing of new single agent administration schedules may be possible with the oral form of triapine  which to date has been studied in a small number of patients to determine its absorption in the bloodstream following a single dose 
a phase i trial sponsored by the nci of an oral formulation of triapine began in december in october  we entered into a license with beijing pason pharmaceuticals  inc pason whereby we granted pason the exclusive rights to develop  manufacture and market triapine in the people s republic of china  taiwan  hong kong and macao 
products in preclinical development vnp vnp is an additional cytotoxic cell damaging compound 
vnp has been demonstrated in preclinical studies to be highly selective for hypoxic poorly oxygenated cells which are found in tumors and are often hard to treat with conventional anticancer agents 
in the third quarter of  we initiated additional preclinical studies on vnp that were requested by the fda after we submitted an investigational new drug ind application for this product in june we plan to resubmit the ind for vnp with the new information by the end of hydrazones hydrazones are anticancer compounds that have demonstrated potent anti tumor effects in preclinical studies 
the mechanisms of action for these compounds are unidentified at this time but appear to be unlike any commercially available anticancer agents of which we know 
in december  we entered into an exclusive research collaboration and option agreement related to these compounds with a group of inventors from the institute of pharmacy and the institute of medicinal chemistry and biochemistry at the university of innsbruck  and austria wirtschaftsservice gesellschaft mbh in september  we entered into an exclusive license for these compounds 
we continued to evaluate these compounds in preclinical studies in 
table of contents drug delivery technology tapet tumor amplified protein expression therapy tapet is a proprietary technology that uses genetically altered salmonella bacteria to deliver cancer fighting drugs preferentially to solid tumors 
extensive preclinical studies in in vivo models have shown that tapet bacteria migrate to and penetrate throughout solid tumors 
inside the tumors  tapet bacteria double in quantity every to minutes  achieving very high bacterial counts  reaching ratios in tumor versus normal tissues of in addition  tapet can be genetically engineered to deliver anticancer agents continuously within the tumor 
we conducted limited clinical trials of tapet in europe from to in  we will continue to seek a partner to assist with future development of tapet technology

under these licenses  we are also required to defend and indemnify yale for any damages arising out o f its use or sale of the licensed products by us or our transferees 
other agreements license agreement with beijing pason pharmaceuticals  inc effective september  we entered into a license with pason providing them with the exclusive rights to develop  manufacture and market triapine in the people s republic of china  taiwan  hong kong and macao the pason territory 
the terms of the agreement included an initial payment of  which we received in november  million in potential additional milestone payments  and potential royalty payments of of any triapine revenues in the pason territory 
pason will fund the preclinical and clinical development necessary for regulatory approval of triapine in the pason t erritory 
license agreement with austrian inventors and austria wirtschaftsservice gesellschaft mbh in december  we entered into a research collaboration and option agreement for certain novel compounds  hydrazones  with a group of inventors from the institute of pharmacy and the institute of medical chemistry and biochemistry at the university of innsbruck  and austria wirtschaftsservice gesellschaft mbh in december  we made an initial payment of  to enter into the agreement 
in september  we entered into an exclusive license for these compounds and made an additional payment of  under this license agreement  we must make

we continue to evaluate the hydrazone compounds in preclinical studies 
competition competition in the biopharmaceutical industry is intense and based on scientific and technological factors  the availability of patent and other protection for technology and products  the ability to finance and commercialize technological developments  and the ability to obtain governmental approval for testing  manufacturing and marketing drugs 
numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have publicly announced their intention to develop anticancer drugs including  in some instances  agents to be used for the treatment of aml or alkylating agents like our compound cloretazine vnpm  or agents that target ribonucleotide reductase like our compound triapine 
these companies include  but are not limited to  amgen inc  astrazeneca plc  bioenvision  inc  bristol myers squibb company  chiron corporation  eli lilly and co  genentech inc  genzyme corporation  imclone systems inc  johnson johnson  lorus therapeutics inc  mgi pharma  inc  osi pharmaceuticals  inc  pfizer inc  pharmion corp  schering plough corporation  wyeth  and xanthus pharmaceuticals  inc our competitors may have substantially greater financial  technical and human resources than we have and may be better equipped to develop  manufacture and market products 
in addition  many of these companies have extensive experience in preclinical testing and human clinical trials  and in obtaining regulatory approvals 
our competitors may succeed in obtaining approval for products more rapidly and in developing and commercializing products that are safer and more effective than those that we propose to develop 
we expect cloretazine reg  vnpm  if approved for the treatment of aml  to compete with cytarabine  a generic compound also known as ara c  which is also used with the anthracycline agents daunorubicin  idarubicin and mitoxanthrone  mylotarg marketed by wyeth  and  if approved for aml  clolar or evoltra clofarabine  under development for this indication by genzyme us and bioenvision europe  zarnestra tipifarnib  under development for this indication by johnson johnson  velcade bortezomib  under development for this indication by millenium  avastin bevacizumab  under development for this indication by genentech  vidaza azacitidine  under development for this indication by pharmion  and dacogen decitabine  under development for this indication by mgi pharma  among others 
the existence of these products  other products or treatments of which we are not aware  or products or treatments that may be developed in the future  may adversely affect the marketability of our products by rendering them less competitive or obsolete 
these companies  as well as academic institutions  governmental agencies and private research organizations  also compete with us in acquiring rights to products or technologies from universities  and recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants 
the timing of market introduction of our potential products or of the products of others will be an important competitive factor 
accordingly  the relative speed with which we can develop products  complete preclinical testing  clinical trials and regulatory approval processes  and supply commercial quantities to market will influence our ability to bring a product to market 
patents  licenses and trade secrets our policy is to protect our technology by  among other means  filing patent applications for technology that we consider important to the development of our business 
we intend to file additional patent applications  when appropriate  relating to new developments or improvements in our technology and other specific products that we develop 
we also rely on trade secrets  know how and continuing technological innovations  as well as patents we have licensed or may license from other parties to develop and maintain our competitive position 
in connection with our license agreement with yale dated august  we are the exclusive licensee  subject to certain rights retained by yale  of a number of issued patents and pending us and foreign patent applications relating to

we are also the exclusive licensee from yale of an issued us patent and several foreign patents on ks  a hypoxia selective anticancer agent 
vion has also licensed from yale one issued us and several foreign patents and pending patent applications relating to synthetic melanin and methods for using synthetic melanin  such as for sunscreen or self tanning agents  relevant to our melasyn technology 
pursuant to our license agreement with yale dated december  we are the exclusive licensee of a number of issued patents and pending patent applications  us and foreign  relating to our tapet technology  which include claims for methods of diagnosing and or treating various solid tumor cancers  including melanoma  lung cancer  breast cancer and colon cancer 
we also have rights  either by license and or by assignment  to issued patents and pending patent applications  us and foreign  relating to our tapet technology 
in addition  we have filed a number of us provisional and non provisional patent applications  an international patent application and a number of foreign patent applications related to this technology 
we or our licensors are prosecuting the patent applications related to products we license both with the us patent and trademark office pto and various foreign patent agencies  but we do not know whether any of our applications will result in the issuance of any patents or  whether any issued patent will provide significant proprietary protection or will be circumvented or invalidated 
during the course of patent prosecution  patent applications are evaluated for  among other things  utility  novelty  non obviousness  written description and enablement 
the pto may require that the claims of an initially filed patent application be amended if it is determined that the scope of the claims include subject matter that is not usef ul  novel  non obvious  described adequately or enabled 
furthermore  in certain instances  the practice of a patentable invention may require a license from the holder of dominant patent rights 
we cannot predict whether our patent applications or our competitors patent applications will result in valid patents being issued 
an issued patent is entitled to a presumption of validity 
the presumption may be challenged in litigation  a court could find any patent of ours or of our competitors invalid and or unenforceable 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us  may also be necessary to enforce our patent and proprietary rights and or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others 
the patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms generally is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
to date  no consistent policy has emerged regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents 
government regulation overview 
regulation by state and federal governmental authorities in the us and foreign countries is a significant factor in the development of our anticancer products  and will be a significant factor in manufacturing and marketing of these products  if they are successfully developed and approved for sale 
all of our products will require regulatory clearances or approvals prior to commercialization 
in particular  drugs  biological agents and medical devices are subject to rigorous testing and other approval requirements by the fda pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and the public health service act and its regulations  as well as by similar health authorities in foreign countries 
various federal statutes and regulations also govern or influence the testing  manufacturing  safety  labeling  packaging  advertising  storage  registration  listing and recordkeeping related to marketing of such products 
regulatory approval often takes a number of years and involves the expenditure of substantial resources 
approval time also depends on a number of factors  including the severity of the disease in question  the availability of alternative treatments and the risks and benefits demonstrated in clinical trials 
we cannot be certain that any required fda or other regulatory approval will be granted or  if granted  will not be withdrawn 
the development of a therapeutic drug typically first requires preclinical testing 
preclinical development of therapeutic drugs and biological agents is generally conducted in the laboratory to 
table of contents evaluate the safety and the potential efficacy of a compound by relevant in vitro and in vivo testing 
when a product is tested prospectively to determine its safety for purposes of obtaining fda approvals or clearances  such testing must be performed in accordance with good laboratory practices for non clinical studies 
the results of preclinical testing are submitted to the fda as part of an ind 
the ind must become effective  the study must be approved by an institutional review board  and informed consent must be obtained from the clinical subjects  before human clinical trials can begin 
typically  clinical evaluation involves a three phase process 
in phase i  clinical trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the tolerated drug dose  early safety profile  proper scheduling and the pattern of drug distribution  absorption and metabolism 
in phase ii  clinical trials are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specific disease in order to determine efficacy  dose response relationships and expanded evidence of safety 
in phase iii  large scale  multi center  controlled clinical trials are conducted in order to

provide enough data for statistical proof of safety and efficacy

compare the experimental therapy to existing therapies

uncover any unexpected safety problems  such as side effects  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif

generate product labeling 
in the case of drugs for cancer and other life threatening diseases  the initial human testing is generally conducted in patients rather than in healthy volunteers 
tests of our product candidates and human clinical trials may be delayed or terminated due to factors such as unfavorable results or insufficient patient enrollment 
furthermore  the fda may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds 
delays in tests and trials may have a material adverse effect on our business 
the planned interim evaluation of safety and efficacy for our phase iii trial of cloretazine vnpm based on patients by its data safety monitoring board dsmb is presently anticipated to occur in the second quarter of based on the evaluation of the first patients accrued in the phase iii trial  the dsmb will determine whether to allow the trial to continue as currently designed  whether the trial design should be modified  or whether the trial should be terminated completely 
there can be no assurance as to the results of the evaluation of these patients or the timing of completion of this evaluation and there should be no inference that the trial has achieved positive results to date or that the dsmb will allow the phase iii trial to continue 
the results of the preclinical and clinical testing are submitted to the fda either as part of a new drug application nda for drugs  or a biologics license application bla for biologics  for approval to commence commercial distribution 
for a biologic drug  the manufacturer generally must also obtain approval of an establishment license application 
in responding to an nda or bla  the fda may grant marketing approval  request additional information or deny the application if it determines that the application does not satisfy its regulatory approval criteria 
it may take several years to obtain approval after submission of an nda or bla  although approval is not assured 
the fda also normally conducts a pre approval inspection and other occasional inspections of an applicant s facilities to ensure compliance with current good manufacturing practices 
further  stringent fda regulatory requirements continue after a product is approved for marketing  and changes to products or labeling can require additional approvals 
if any of our products is approved for marketing  we will be subject to stringent post marketing requirements 

table of contents we also will be subject to widely varying foreign regulations governing clinical trials and pharmaceutical sales 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained before marketing the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
we intend  to the extent possible  to rely on foreign licensees to obtain regulatory approval to market our products in foreign countries 
in october  we received orphan drug designation for cloretazine vnpm in aml 
under the orphan drug act  a sponsor may obtain designation by the fda of a drug or biologic as an orphan drug for a particular indication 
orphan drug designation is granted to drugs for rare diseases or conditions  including many cancers  with a prevalence of less than  cases in the united states 
the sponsor of a drug that has obtained orphan drug designation and which is the first to obtain approval of a marketing application for such drug  which approval cannot be assured  is entitled to marketing exclusivity for a period of seven years for the designated indication 
this m eans that no other company can market the same orphan drug for the same indication approved by the fda for seven years after approval unless such company proves its drug is clinically superior or the approved orphan drug marketer cannot supply demand for the drug 
legislation is periodically considered that could significantly affect the orphan drug law 
we intend to seek additional orphan drug designations for our products where appropriate 
there can be no assurance that future changes to the orphan drug act would not diminish the value of any orphan drug designation obtained by us 
fda regulatory procedures established in are intended to speed further the availability of new drugs intended to treat life threatening and severely debilitating illnesses 
these procedures provide for early and continuous consultation with the fda regarding preclinical and clinical studies necessary to gain marketing approval 
this regulatory framework also provides that if phase i results demonstrate potential  phase ii clinical trials may be designed that obviate the need for lengthy  expensive phase iii testing 
notwithstanding the foregoing  approval may be denied by the fda or traditional phase iii studies may be required 
the fda may also seek our agreement to perform post approval phase iv studies  which confirm produ ct safety and efficacy 
in january  we received orphan drug designation for cloretazine vnpm for the treatment of aml in europe 
orphan drug status is granted by the european commission to promote development of drugs to treat rare diseases or conditions 
orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage or shorten the duration of the emea review and approval process 
orphan drug designation may entitle cloretazine vnpm to i ten years of market exclusivity for the indication of aml  ii protocol assistance from the european medicines agency to optimize drug development in preparing a dossier that will meet regulatory requirements  iii red uced fees associated with applying for market approval  and iv access to european union research funding 
in addition to regulations relating to drug development  we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations  including those promulgated by the occupational safety and health administration osha  the environmental protection agency epa and the nuclear regulatory commission nrc  that govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects  such as discharges to air and water  as well as handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes 
these laws also impose strict liability for the costs of cleaning up  and for damages resulting from  sites of past spills  disposals or other releases of hazardous substances and materials for the investigation and remediation of env ironmental contamination at properties operated by us and at off site locations where we have arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances 
we have made  and will continue to make  expenditures for our facilities to comply with current and future environmental laws 
to date  we have not incurred significant costs and are not aware of any significant liabilities associated with our compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
however  environmental laws have changed in recent years and we may become subject to stricter environmental standards in the future and may face large capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws 
we have limited capital and are uncertain whether we will be able to pay for significantly large capital expenditures 
also  future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental m atters may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents all of our operations are performed under strict environmental and health safety controls consistent with osha  epa and nrc regulations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to control all health and safety problems 
if we cannot control those problems  we may be held liable and may be required to pay the costs of remediation 
these liabilities and costs could be material 
manufacturing and marketing we do not have experience in manufacturing any products for commercial use  or in marketing  distributing or selling any products  and have not yet commercially introduced any products 
we do not currently have the capability to manufacture or market  distribute or sell on a commercial scale any products that we develop 
we currently use third parties to manufacture limited quantities of our products for use in clinical activities 
since september  we have manufactured our active pharmaceutical ingredient api at safc  inc formerly tetrionics  inc 
our contract with safc  inc 
expires in september but is automatically extended for a twelve month period unless terminated with days notice by either party 
we are in discussions with safc  inc to extend the term of this agreement 
in december  we entered into a manufacturing agreement with ben venue laboratories  a division of boeringher ingelheim 
under the terms of the manufacturing agreement  which expires on december   ben venue laboratories will be our exclus ive manufacturer of cloretazine vnpm finished drug product in the united states 
we will need to validate our manufacturing processes for cloretazine vnpm and our other products before we can sell them commercially 
we expect to validate the manufacturing process for cloretazine vnpm api and finished product at safc  inc and ben venue laboratories  respectively  but will not be able to market any product until we complete these validations as part of the regulatory approval process 
if our products are approved for sale by regulatory authorities  we will need to develop our capabilities to market  distribute and sell our products or contract with third parties to do so 
in the event we decide to establish a marketing and sales force  we will be required to hire and retain additional personnel 
in  we spent million on initial pre launch marketing efforts for cloretazine vnpm  including attendance at industry conferences  meetings with key opinion leaders  and initial medical education  pricing and epidemiology studies 
during  we plan to continue our pre launch marketing efforts for cloretazine vnpm  including attendance at industry conferences  meetings with key opinion leaders  and completion of certain marketing studies 
employees as of december   we had full time employees

a delay in obtaining regulatory approvals for any of our drug candidates will also have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the near term  we are heavily dependant on the success of our lead product candidate cloretazine vnpm which is still under development 
if cloretazine vnpm is not successful in clinical trials or we do not obtain fda approval of cloretazine vnpm  or if fda delays approval or narrows the indications for which we may market cloretazine vnpm  our business will be materially adversely affected 
we anticipate that our ability to generate revenues in the foreseeable future will depend on the successful development and commercialization of cloretazine vnpm 
the commercial success of cloretazine vnpm will depend on several factors  including successful completion of our ongoing phase iii and pivotal phase ii clinical trials for cloretazine vnpm  receipt of 
table of contents approvals from the fda and similar foreign regulatory authorities  establishing commercial manufacturing capabilities through third party manufacturers  successfully launching commercial sales of the products  either ourselves or through third parties  and acceptance of the products in the medical community and by third party payers  none of which can be assured 
if the data from our ongoing phase iii and pivotal phase ii clinical trials for cloretazine vnpm are not satisfactory  we may not proceed with the filing for regulatory approval or we may be forced to delay the filing 
even if the fda and similar foreign regulatory authorities do grant approval for cloretazine vnpm  they may narrow the indications for which we are permitted to market it  may pose other restrictions on the use or marketing of the product  or may require us to conduct additional post marketing trials 
a narrowed indication or other re strictions may limit the market potential for cloretazine vnpm and any obligation to conduct additional clinical trials would result in increased expenditures and lower revenues 
if we are not successful in commercializing our lead product candidate cloretazine vnpm  or are significantly delayed or limited in doing so  our business will be materially adversely affected and we may need to curtail or cease operations 
on november   we announced that we had accrued patients to the phase iii trial of our lead anticancer agent cloretazine vnpm 
the trial is evaluating cloretazine vnpm in combination with ara c for the treatment of relapsed aml and is designed to accrue patients if it continues to full accrual 
the planned interim evaluation of safety and efficacy for this trial based on patients by its dsmb is presently anticipated to occur in the second quarter of  although we have limited control over the final timing 
based on the evaluation of the first patients accrued in the phase iii trial  the dsmb will deter mine whether to allow the trial to continue as currently designed  whether the trial design should be modified or whether the trial should be terminated completely 
such a determination would be expected shortly after the data is presented to the dsmb for review 
there can be no assurance as to the results of the evaluation of these patients  or the timing of completion of this evaluation or this trial  and there should be no inference that the trial has achieved favorable results to date or that the dsmb will allow the phase iii trial to continue 
on january   we announced that we had recorded at least nine responses in our pivotal phase ii trial of cloretazine vnpm in elderly patients with de novo poor risk aml 
the trial is designed to continue to a total accrual of patients if there have been at least nine responses in the first patients 
accordingly  we are proceeding to the second stage of accrual 
there can be no assurance as to the results of this trial or the timing of completion of this trial  and there should be no inference that the trial has achieved favorable results to date 
as with all drug development  we would need to reevaluate cloretazine vnpm if it does not test favorably in either of these trials 
in such event  we would either alter the drug or dose as used in the trial  modify the clinical trial protocol or abandon the drug development project 
in any such event  our business  operations and prospects would be materially  adversely affected  and our ability to apply for or obtain regulatory approval might be delayed  or we might not be able to obtain regulatory approval at all 
if we continue to incur operating losses  we may be unable to continue our operations 
we have incurred losses since inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
if we continue to incur operating losses and fail to become a profitable company  we may be unable to continue our operations 
since we began our business  we have focused on research  development and preclinical and clinical trials of product candidates 
we expect to continue to operate at a net loss for at least the next several years as we continue our research and development efforts  continue to conduct drug trials and develop manufacturing  sales  marketing and distribution capabilities 
our future profitability depends on our receiving regulatory approval of our product candidates and our abili ty to successfully manufacture and market approved drugs 
the extent of our future losses and the timing of our profitability are highly uncertain 

table of contents if we fail to obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations  we will be unable to continue or complete our product development 
we will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund operations and complete our product development 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents to fund our operations and continue our product development 
in february  we sold million principal amount of our convertible senior notes  together with common stock purchase warrants  and received net proceeds of approximately million 
we will not have an approved and marketable product for the foreseeable future 
under our current operating plan  if we do not have an approved product for sale which is generating significant revenues  we will need to raise substantial additional capital to have sufficient capital to fund our o perations beyond mid we may not get funding when we need it or on favorable terms 
if we cannot raise adequate funds to satisfy our capital requirements  we may have to delay  scale back or eliminate our research and development activities  clinical studies or future operations 
we might have to license our technology to others 
this could result in sharing revenues which we might otherwise retain for ourselves 
any of these actions may harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the amount of capital we may need depends on many factors  including

limit our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to changes in  our business 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations on the notes will depend upon our future performance  which will be subject to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
if the testing or use of our potential products harms people  we could be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the testing  manufacturing and marketing of drug products 
these risks are particularly inherent in human trials of our proposed products 
unacceptable side effects may be discovered during preclinical and clinical testing of one or more of our potential products 
side effects and other liability risks could give rise to viable product liability claims against us 
while we have obtained insurance coverage for patients enrolled in clinical trials  we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms  
table of contents insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities  and we may need additional insurance coverage for expanded clinical trials and commercial activity 
as a result  product liability claims  even if successfully defended  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the side effects are determined to be unacceptable  we will not be able to commercialize our products 
if we are found to be infringing on patents or trade secrets owned by others  we may be forced to cease or alter our drug development efforts  obtain a license to continue the development or sale of our products  and or pay damages 
our manufacturing processes and potential products may conflict with patents that have been or may be granted to competitors  universities or others  or the trade secrets of those persons and entities 
as the drug development industry expands and more patents are issued  the risk increases that our processes and potential products may give rise to claims that they infringe the patents or trade secrets of others 
these other persons could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin clinical testing  manufacturing and marketing of the affected product or process 
if any of these actions are successful  in addition to any potential liability for damages  we could be required to obtain a license in order to c ontinue to conduct clinical tests  manufacture or market the affected product or use the affected process 
required licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and the results of litigation are uncertain 
if we become involved in litigation or other proceedings  it could consume a substantial portion of our financial resources and the efforts of our personnel 
we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our trade secrets 
if these agreements are breached by our employees or other parties  our trade secrets may become known to our competitors 
we rely on trade secrets that we seek to protect through confidentiality agreements with our employees and other parties 
if these agreements are breached  our competitors may obtain and use our trade secrets to gain a competitive advantage over us 
we may not have any remedies against our competitors and any remedies that may be available to us may not be adequate to protect our business or compensate us for the damaging disclosure 
in addition  we may have to expend resources to protect our interests from possible infringement by others 
a substantial portion of our technology is subject to limited retained rights of our licensors  and we may not be able to prevent the grant of similar rights to third parties 
a substantial portion of our technology is licensed from academic institutions which technology license agreements are subject to the federal bayh dole act  pursuant to which the federal government has certain limited rights to use the technology and to even require us to grant a license to one or more third parties if we are not fully developing the technology 
in certain cases we also have the right to practice improvements on the licensed technology to the extent they are encompassed by the licensed patents and within our field of use 
our licensors may currently own and may in the future obtain additional patents and patent applications that are helpful for the development  manufacture and commercial sale of our anticipated products 
we may be unable to agree with one or more academic institutions from which we have obtained licenses that certain intellectual property developed by researchers at these academic institutions is covered by our existing licenses 
in the event that the new intellectual property is not covered by our existing licenses  we would be required to negotiate a ne w license agreement 
we may not be able to reach agreement with current or future licensors on commercially reasonable terms  if at all  or the terms may not permit us to sell our products at a profit after payment of royalties  which could harm our business 
our licenses generally also may be terminated by the licensor if we default in performance of our obligations 
if any of our licenses are terminated  we may lose certain rights to manufacture  sell  market and distribute products which would significantly reduce our actual and potential revenues and have a material and negative impact on our operations 

table of contents our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies 
our commercial success will depend in part on our obtaining and maintaining patent  trade secret  copyright and trademark protection of our technologies in the united states and other jurisdictions as well as successfully enforcing this intellectual property and defending this intellectual property against third party challenges 
we will only be able to protect our technologies from unauthorized use by third parties to the extent that valid and enforceable intellectual property protections  such as patents or trade secrets  cover them 
in particular  we place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies  products and processes 
furthermore  the degree of future protection o f our proprietary rights is uncertain because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage 
moreover  the degree of future protection of our proprietary rights is uncertain for products that are currently in the early stages of development because we cannot predict which of these products will ultimately reach the commercial market or whether the commercial versions of these products will incorporate proprietary technologies 
our patent position is highly uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions 
accordingly  we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third party patents 
for example

spacer 
gif 
we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable 
as a result  our owned and licensed patents may not be valid and we may not be able to obtain and enforce patents and to maintain trade secret protection for our technology 
the extent to which we are unable to do so could materially harm our business 
we or our licensors have applied for and will continue to apply for patents for certain products 
such applications may not result in the issuance of any patents  and any patents now held or that may be issued may not provide us with adequate protection from competition 
furthermore  it is possible that patents issued or licensed to us may be challenged successfully 
in that event  if we have a preferred competitive position because of such patents  any preferred position held by us would be lost 
if we are unable to secure or to continue to maintain a preferred position  we could become subject to competition from the sale of generic products 
patents issued or licensed to us may be infringed by the products or processes of others 
the cost of enforcing our patent rights against infringers  if such enforcement is required  could be significant  and the time demands could interfere with our normal operations 
there has been substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical technology industries 
we may become a party to patent litigation and other proceedings 
the cost to us of any patent litigation  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources 
litigation may also absorb significant management time 

table of contents unpatented trade secrets  improvements  confidential know how and continuing technological innovation are important to our scientific and commercial success 
although we attempt to and will continue to attempt to protect our proprietary information through reliance on trade secret laws and the use of confidentiality agreements with our corporate partners  collaborators  employees and consultants and other appropriate means  these measures may not effectively prevent disclosure of our proprietary information  and  in any event  others may develop independently  or obtain access to  the same or similar information 
certain of our patent rights are licensed to us by third parties 
if we fail to comply with the terms of these license agreements  our rights to those patents may be terminated  and we will be unable to conduct our business 
if we fail to recruit and retain key personnel  our research and development programs may be delayed 
we are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management and scientific personnel  particularly  alan kessman  our chief executive officer and director  howard b 
johnson  our president and chief financial officer  ann lee cahill  our vice president  clinical development  ivan king  phd  our vice president  research and development  meghan fitzgerald  our vice president and chief business officer  and aileen ryan  our vice president  regulatory affairs 
there is intense competition in the drug development industry for qualified scientific and technical personnel 
since our business is very technical and specialized  we need to continue to attract and retain such people 
we may not be able to continue to attract and reta in the qualified personnel necessary for developing our business  particularly in light of our need to raise substantial additional financing in order to continue our operations beyond mid we have no key man insurance policies on any of the officers listed above and we only have an employment agreement with mr 
kessman 
if we lose the services of our management and scientific personnel or fail to recruit other scientific and technical personnel  our research and product development programs will be significantly and detrimentally affected 
we face intense competition in the market for anticancer products  and if we are unable to compete successfully  our business will suffer 
numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have publicly announced their intention to develop drugs for the treatment of cancer including  in some instances  the development of agents which treat aml and or are alkylating agents similar to our compound cloretazine vnpm and agents which target ribonucleotide reductase similar to our compound triapine 
these companies include  but are not limited to amgen inc  astrazeneca plc  bioenvision  inc  bristol myers squibb company  chiron corporation  eli lilly and co  genentech inc  genzyme corporation  imclone systems inc  johnson johnson  lorus therapeutics inc  mgi pharma  inc  osi pharmaceuticals  inc  pfizer inc  pharmion corp  schering plough corporation  wyeth  and xanthus pharmaceuticals  inc these and other large pharmaceutical companies have substantially greater financial and other resources and development capabilities than we do and have substantially greater experience in undertaking preclinical and clinical testing of products  obtaining regulatory approvals  and manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products 
in addition  our competitors may succeed in obtaining approval for products more rapidly than us and in developing and commercializing products that are safer and more effective than those that we propose to develop 
the existence of these products  other products or treatments of which we are not aware or products or treatments that may be developed in the future may adversely affect the marketability of our products by rendering them less competitive or obsolete 
in addition to competing with universities and other research institutions in the de velopment of products  technologies and processes  we may compete with other companies in acquiring rights to products or technologies from universities 

table of contents if our corporate partners  licensors  licensees  collaborators at research institutions and others do not conduct activities in accordance with our arrangements  our research and development efforts may be delayed 
our strategy for the research  development and commercialization of our products entails entering into various arrangements with corporate partners  licensors  licensees  collaborators at research institutions and others

if the third parties do not conduct activities in accordance with the arrangements we have with them  or if these arrangements are terminated  our product development efforts may be delayed 
we may also rely on other collaborative partners to obtain regulatory approvals and to manufacture and market our products 
the amount and timing of resources to be devoted to these activities by these other parties may not be within our control 
if yale does not conduct research relating to products we would like to pursue  we may never realize any benefits from our funding provided to yale 
through december   we have paid approximately million to yale for research funding 
we have agreed to pay an additional  to support the research activities of one of our directors  an affiliate of yale  through march  we may continue to support certain research projects at yale 
we generally do not have the right to control the research that yale is conducting with our funding  and our funds may not be used to conduct research relating to products that we would like to pursue 
additionally  if the research being conducted by yale results in technologies that yale has not already licensed or agreed to license to us  we may need to negotiate additional license agreements or we may be unable to util ize those technologies 
if we are unable to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  or to enter into agreements with third parties to do so  we will be unable to successfully market and sell future drug products 
we have no experience with marketing  sales and distribution of drug products and have only recently established pre commercial capability in those areas 
if we are unable to establish capabilities to sell  market and distribute our products  either by developing our own capabilities or entering into agreements with others  we will not be able to successfully sell our future drug products 
in that event  we will not be able to generate significant revenues 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to hire the qualified sales and marketing personnel we need 
we may not be able to enter into any marketing or distribution agreements with third party providers on acceptable terms  if at all 
we rely on third party manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates 
if these third party manufacturers fail to manufacture product candidates of satisfactory quality  in a timely manner  in sufficient quantities or at acceptable costs  development and commercialization of our products could be delayed 
we have no manufacturing facilities  and we have no experience in the commercial manufacturing of drugs or in validating drug manufacturing processes 
we have contracted with third party manufacturers to produce our product candidates for regulatory approvals clinical trials 
we have 
table of contents limited supplies of our product candidates for clinical trials 
if our supplies are damaged or destroyed  either during storage or shipping or otherwise  our clinical trials may be delayed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we intend to rely on third party contract manufacturers to manufacture  supply  store and distribute commercial quantities of our product candidates 
we will also rely on our third party manufacturing partners to work with us to complete the chemistry  manufacturing and control  or cmc  section of any nondisclosure agreements or any marketing approval application we may file 
contract manufacturers are obliged to operate in accordance with government mandated obligations  including fda mandated current good manufacturing practices cgmps 
a failure of any of our contract manufacturers to establish and follow cgmps or to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the availability of material for clinical trials and may delay or prevent filing or approval of marketing applications for our products 
changing contract manufacturers may be difficult  and the number of potential manufacturers is limited 
changing manufacturers requires validation of the manufacturing processes and procedures in accordance with government mandated obligations  including fda mandated cgmps 
such validation may be costly and time consuming 
it may be difficult or impossible for us to find replacement manufacturers on acceptable terms quickly  if at all 
either of these factors could delay or prevent the completion of our clinical trials  the approval of our product candidates by the fda or other regulatory agencies  or the commercialization of our products  result in higher costs  or cause a decline in potential product revenues 
drug manufacturers are subject to on going  periodic unannounced inspections by the fda and corresponding state and foreign agencies to ensure strict compliance with cgmps  other government regulations and corresponding foreign standards 
while we are obligated to audit the performance of third party contractors  we do not have control over our third party manufacturers compliance with these regulations and standards 
failure by our third party manufacturers or us to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us  including fines  injunctions  civil penalties  failure of the government to grant market approval of drugs  delays  suspension of clinical trials  withdrawal of approvals  seizure s  detentions or recalls of product  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
to date  our product candidates have been manufactured in small quantities by third party manufacturers for preclinical and clinical trials 
we have not validated the manufacturing process for cloretazine vnpm to date 
in order to obtain marketing approval for any of these product candidates  we will need to enter into and maintain long term supply agreements with our existing or new third party manufacturers  such as our agreement with ben venue laboratories  and demonstrate that we can manufacture sufficient quantities under a validated manufacturing process for commercial sale 
our third party manufacturers may terminate our agreements  may not be able to successfully increase their manufacturing capacity  validate our manufacturing process  or apply at commercial scale the current manufacturing process for any of our product candidates in a timely or economic manner  or at all 
this may require seeking out additional manufacturing partners who may have different equipment requiring additional validation studies  which the relevant government regulator must review and approve 
if we are unable to successfully validate or increase the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate  the regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate may be delayed or there may be a shortage in the supply of the product candidate 
our product candidates require precise  high quality manufacturing 
the failure of our third party manufacturers to achieve and maintain these high manufacturing standards  including the incidence of manufacturing errors  could result in patient injury or death  product recalls or withdrawals  delays or failures in product testing or delivery  cost overr uns or other problems that could seriously harm our business 
if environmental laws become stricter in the future  we may face large capital expenditures in order to comply with environmental laws 
we cannot accurately predict the outcome or timing of future expenditures that we may be required to expend to comply with comprehensive federal  state and local environmental laws and 
table of contents regulations 
we must comply with environmental laws that govern  among other things  all emissions  waste water discharge and solid and hazardous waste disposal  and the remediation of contamination associated with generation  handling and disposal activities 
to date  we have not incurred significant costs and are not aware of any significant liabilities associated with our compliance with federal  state and local laws and regulations 
however  environmental laws have changed in recent years and we may become subject to stricter environmental standards in the future and may face large capital expenditures to comply with environmental laws 
we have limited capital and are uncertain whether we will be able to pay for significantly large capital expenditures 
also  future developments  administrative actions or liabilities relating to environmental matters may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
all of our operations are performed under strict environmental and health safety controls consistent with the occupational safety and health administration  the environmental protection agency and the nuclear regulatory commission regulations 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to control all health and safety problems 
if we cannot control those problems  we may be held liable and may be required to pay the costs of remediation 
these liabilities and costs could be material 
we may expand our business through new acquisitions that could disrupt our business  harm our financial condition and may also dilute current stockholders ownership interests in our company 
our business strategy includes expanding our products and capabilities  and we may seek acquisitions to do so 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including

the potential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies 
we cannot assure you that any acquisition will result in short term or long term benefits to us 
we may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business 
in addition  our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with some of these acquisitions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to make the combination of our business with that of acquired businesses or companies work or be successful 
furthermore  the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business or companies may require a substantial capital investment by us 
we may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
we may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our common stock  which could dilute current stockholder s ownership interest in our company 
our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq capital market sm 
among other things  delisting from the nasdaq capital market sm would cause us to become ineligible to use form s for the registration of the resale of our securities held by certain of our security holders 
if the price of our common stock declines below per share  we may fail to meet nasdaq s maintenance criteria  which may result in the delisting of our common stock from the nasdaq capital market sm 
in the event of such delisting  trading  if any  in our common stock may then continue to be conducted in the non nasdaq over the counter market in what are commonly referred to as the electronic bulletin board and the pink sheets 
as a result  an investor may find it more difficult to dispose of or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our common stock 
in addition  we would be subject to a rule promulgated by the sec that  if we fail to meet criteria set forth in such 
table of contents rule  imposes various practice requirements on broker dealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors 
for these types of transactions  the broker dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and have received the purchaser s written consent to the transactions prior to the sale 
consequently  the rule may have a materially adverse effect on the ability of broker dealers to sell our securities  which may materially affect the ability of stockholders to sell our securities in the secondary market 
a delisting from the nasdaq capital market sm will also make us ineligible to use form s to register the sale of shares of our common stock or to register the resale of our securities held by certain of our security holders with the sec  thereby making it more difficult and expensive for us to register our common stock or other securities and raise additional capital 
we are a party to several registration rights agreements which require us to maintain the effectiveness of registration statements relating to the resale of shares of common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and upon conversion of our outstanding notes by holders of such warrants and notes 
if we are inel igible to use form s  we will need to file new registration statements on some other permitted form and maintenance of the effectiveness of such registration statements will become extremely difficult 
under the applicable registration rights agreements  we could become subject to certain liquidated damages upon and during the continuance of any such failure 
we would also incur additional costs under state blue sky laws to sell equity if we are delisted 
the terms of our outstanding notes and warrants  as well as any additional funding we raise in the future could cause extreme dilution to our stockholders 
further  the large number of our shares that may be held in the market may depress the market price of our stock 
the conversion of some or all of our outstanding notes  our payment of interest or make whole premiums on the notes under certain circumstances with shares of common stock  and the exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the sale of the notes  will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders 
as of december   we also had outstanding warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from to per share 
all such shares have been registered for resale on registration statements filed with the sec and will be freely tradable when issued upon exercise of the warrants 
in addition  as of december   there were  shares of common stock issuabl e upon exercise of options granted by us 
we may also grant awards under our stock incentive plan to purchase up to an additional  shares of common stock 
further  to the extent we determine that we need additional financing and we encounter additional opportunities to raise cash  we would likely sell additional equity or debt securities 
depending on our stock price and market conditions at the time of any capital raise  and the amount of capital we need  such debt or equity securities may be sold at relatively low prices  including prices which are below the market price of our common stock  and may have substantial rights to control us 
stockholders would experience extreme dilution as well as subordination of their rights 
other than as set forth in the indenture governing the notes  we do not have any contractual restrictions on our ability to incur debt 
any indebtedness could contain covenants that restrict our operations 
any sales in the public market of the common stock paid as interest or as a make whole premium  issuable upon conversion of the notes or exercise of warrants  the exercise of outstanding options or the issuance of equity pursuant to our stock incentive plan  could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception that such sales are likely to occur  could also affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock 
the rights that have been and may in the future be granted to our stockholders may allow our board of directors and management to deter a potential acquisition in which the board of directors and management are to be replaced 
we have in place a stockholder rights plan  or poison pill  which enables our board of directors to issue rights to purchase common stock when someone acquires or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
as a result of the plan  anyone wishing to take over the 
table of contents company would most likely be forced to negotiate a transaction with our board of directors and management in order not to trigger the pill 
the need to negotiate with the board of directors or management could frustrate a proposed takeover particularly where the board of directors and management wish to remain entrenched 
this would prevent our stockholders from participating in a takeover or tender offer  which might be of substantial value to them 
provisions of our outstanding convertible senior notes could discourage an acquisition of us by a third party 
certain provisions of our outstanding convertible senior notes could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us  including a provision requiring an acquirer to assume all of our obligations under the notes and the indenture 
upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change under the indenture relating to the notes  holders of the notes will have the right  at their option  to require us to repurchase all of their notes or any portion of the principal amount of such notes 
after giving effect to the sale of our convertible senior notes and warrants in february and the reservation of shares for potential issuance upon conversion or exercise  we have limited shares of common stock authorized and available for issuance 
as of march   we had  authorized shares of common stock under our certificate of incorporation  as amended  of which  were issued and outstanding 
an aggregate of additional  shares of common stock were reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding warrants and options  as well as for potential issuance under our stock incentive plan and our vion employee stock purchase plan 
in addition  our convertible notes are convertible into  shares of common stock 
after reserving shares for potential issuance upon conversion of our convertible senior notes  the exercise of the warrants sold in connection with the sale of the notes  the potential payment of interest on the notes with shares of common stock and make whole premiums on the notes with shares of common stock  we have limited shares of common stock authorized and available for other purposes  including potential acquisitions  potential issuances in connection with a strategic relationship  and potential issuance under our rights plan 
accordingly  unless and until we can amend out certificate of incorporation to authorize more shares of common stock  which would require stockholder approval  we may not be able to take advantage of corporate opportunities which might come to our attention which would require the issuance of common stock 
in addition  in any situation where our shareholder rights may become exercisable  we will not be able to issue more than a de minimus number of shares upon the exercise of the shareholder rights  thereby frustrating the purpose of the rights plan

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation overview we are a development stage pharmaceutical company engaged in the development of therapeutics for the treatment of cancer 
our activities to date have consisted primarily of research and product development  preclinical trials of product candidates  obtaining regulatory approval for clinical trials  conducting clinical trials  negotiating and obtaining collaborative agreements  and obtaining financing in support of these activities 
historically  our revenues have primarily consisted of contract research grants  technology license fees  and research and laboratory support service fees 
since inception  we have generated minimal revenues and have incurred substantial operating losses from our activities 
we expect to incur substanti al operating losses for the next several years due to expenses associated with our activities 
we have five research and development projects  which include two product candidates in clinical trials cloretazine vnpm and triapine  two product development programs in preclinical development vnp and the hydrazones and one drug delivery technology tapet for which we are seeking a development partner 
the following table provides information concerning the commencement dates of our clinical trials of cloretazine vnpm sponsored by us that remain open for patient accrual as of march

on november   we announced that we had accrued patients to the phase iii trial of our lead anticancer agent cloretazine vnpm 
the trial is evaluating cloretazine vnpm in combination with ara c for the treatment of relapsed aml and is designed to accrue patients if it continues to full accrual 
the planned interim evaluation of safety and efficacy for this trial based on patients by its dsmb is presently anticipated to occur in the second quarter of  although we have limited control over the final timing 
based on the evaluation of the first patients accrued in the phase iii trial  the dsmb will deter mine whether to allow the trial to continue as currently designed  whether the trial design should be modified or whether the trial should be terminated completely 
such a determination would be expected shortly after the data is presented to the dsmb for review 
there can be no assurance as to the results of the evaluation of these patients  or the timing of completion of this evaluation or this trial  and there should be no inference that the trial has achieved favorable results to date or that the dsmb will allow the phase iii trial to continue 
on january   we announced that we had recorded at least nine responses in our pivotal phase ii trial of cloretazine vnpm in elderly patients with de novo poor risk aml 
the trial is designed to continue to a total accrual of patients if there have been at least nine responses in the first patients 
accordingly  we are proceeding to the second stage of accrual 
there can be no assurance as to the results of this trial or the timing of completion of this trial  and there should be no inference that the trial has achieved favorable results to date 
the national cancer institute nci is sponsoring clinical trials of triapine 
we provide product for the nci trials 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more and the length of time can vary substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
factors that can cause delay or termination of our clinical trials include

lack of sufficient funds 
the amount and types of costs incurred during a clinical trial vary depending upon the type of product candidate  the disease treated and the nature of the study 
we budget and monitor our research and development costs by category  as opposed to by product or study 
significant categories of costs include personnel  clinical  third party research and development services  and laboratory supplies 
the cost to take a product candidate through clinical trials is dependent upon  among other things  the targeted disease indication  the timing  size and dosing schedule of the clinical trials for such product candidate  the number of patients enrolled in each trial of the product candidate and the speed at which patients are enrolled and treated 
we could 
table of contents incur increased product development costs if we experience delays in trial enrollment  the evaluation of clinical trial results  or in applying for or obtaining regulatory approvals for any reason including the possible reasons for delay described above 
these uncertainties and variability make it difficult to accurately predict the future cost of or timing to complete our product development projects 
we cannot be certain that any of our products will prove to be safe or effective  will achieve the safety and efficacy needed to proceed through phase iii or registrational clinical trials  will receive regulatory approvals  or will be successfully commercialized 
our clinical trials might prove that our product candidates may not be effective in treating disease or may have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that require us to cease further development of the product 
we expect that we will need to enter into and complete phase iii or registrational clinical trials of our products in order to apply for regulatory approval 
if we achieve successful completion of phase iii or registrational trials  which have commenced or which we may in the future commence  of which there can be no certainty  we intend to submit the results to the us food and drug administration fda to support an application for regulatory approval of the product 
given the uncertainties related to pharmaceutical product development  we are currently unable to reliably estimate when  if ever  our product candidates will generate revenue and cash flows 
we do not expect to receive net cash inflows from any of our major research and development projects until and unless a product candidate becomes a profitable commercial product 
critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstance s 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the following policies to be the most critical to an understanding of our financial condition and results of operations because they require us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we record revenue under technology license agreements in accordance with the following

nonrefundable upfront license fees for which no further performance obligations exist are recognized as revenue on the earlier of when payments are received or collection is assured

nonrefundable upfront license fees including guaranteed  time based payments that require continuing involvement in the form of development or other efforts by us are recognized as revenue ratably over the performance period  and 
spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 

spacer 
gif 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue when milestones  as defined in the applicable agreement  are achieved 
actual license fees received may vary from recorded estimated revenues 
we record revenue from royalties  if any  based on licensees sales of our products or technologies 
revenues are recognized as earned in accordance with the contract terms when royalties from licensees can be reliably measured and collectibility is reasonably assured 
royalty estimates are made in advance of amounts collected based on historical and forecasted trends 
the effect of any change in revenues from technology license agreements would be reflected in revenues in the period such determination was made 
historically  such adjustments have been insignificant 

table of contents research and development expenses we record research and development expenses as incurred 
we disclose clinical trials expenses and other research and development expenses as separate components of research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations to provide more meaningful information to our investors 
these expenses are based  in part  on estimates of certain costs when incurred 
the effect of any change in the clinical trials expenses and other research and development expenses would be reflected in the period such determination was made 
income taxes we provide deferred income taxes for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities  and on operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
except for the provisions recorded for minimum state capital taxes and the sales recorded of certain research and development tax credits to the state of connecticut  we have not recorded a provision or benefit for income taxes in the financial statements due to recurring historical losses 
accordingly  we have provided a full valuation allowance for our deferred income tax asset as of december  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to reduce the valuation allowance in the period of determination 
stock based compensation adoption of sfas r on january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard revised  share based payment  sfas r  using the modified prospective application method 
employee stock based compensation is estimated at the date of grant using the fair value of the stock awards as determined by the black scholes option pricing model and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period 
the black scholes option pricing model requires us to make several assumptions 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of stock based compensation expense as a result of the adoption of sfas r 
the adoption of sfas r increased the basic and diluted loss applicable to common shareholders per share by for the year ended december  prior to the adoption of sfas r  we accounted for share based payments to employees using apb opinion no 
s  accounting for stock issued to employees  intrinsic value method and  as such  generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options 
the adoption of sfas r under the modified prospective application method required us to recognize compensation cost beginning on january  i based on the requirement of sfas r for all share based payments granted after january  and ii based on the requirements of sfas for all awards granted to employees prior to january  tha t remain unvested as of that date 
under the modified prospective application method  prior periods are not restated for the effect of sfas r 
we use the straight line attribution method for all stock option grants 
as of december   the total compensation cost related to unvested awards of restricted stock and stock options not yet recognized in the statement of operations was approximately million  which will be recognized throughout the period ending october see notes and to our consolidated financial statements contained in item of this annual report on form k for further information regarding stock based compensation expense 
recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  sfas provides a common fair value hierarchy for companies to follow in determining fair value measurements in the preparation of financial statements and expands disclosure 
table of contents requirements relating to how such fair value measurements were developed 
sfas clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions that the marketplace would use when pricing an asset or liability  rather than company specific data

the accrual for clinical trials costs expensed but not yet paid is included on our balance sheet 
in the event of termination  certain agreements provide for cancellation fees to be paid by us and for reimbursement of noncancellable commitments that may have been entered into on our behalf 
these potential cancellation fees are not included in the above table 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  including changes to interest rates associated with our cash equivalents and foreign currency exchange rates 
the following describes the nature of these risks which we do not believe to be material to us 
our cash equivalents are generally highly liquid investments in money market funds and us government securities 
these investments are subject to interest rate risk and  as such  our interest income is sensitive to changes in us interest rates 
however  the conservative nature of our investments mitigates our interest rate exposure 
our investments are held for purposes other than trading and we believe that we currently have no material adverse market risk exposure 
the weighted average interest rate on cash equivalents held at december  was approximately 
we have contracts with a vendor outside the us that are denominated in a foreign currency 
to date  fluctuations in this currency have not materially impacted our results of operations 
we have no derivative financial instruments 
we do not believe we have material exposures to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
