item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including changes in interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we also have not entered into financial instruments to manage and reduce the impact of changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates although we may enter into such transactions in the future 
although currently none of our debt bears interest at rates that vary with the prime rate of interest  it is expected that any additional debt which we might incur would carry a floating rate 
if this were the case  any increases in the applicable prime rate of interest would reduce our earnings 
with respect to currency risk  where we have a contract which is denominated in a foreign currency  we often establish local in country bank accounts and fund in country expenses in the local currency  thus creating a natural currency hedge for a portion of the contract
