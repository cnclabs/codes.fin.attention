amortization expense for the year ended december  of  has been reclassified to conform to the current period s presentation 
in  we recognized an impairment of million on goodwill and amortizable intangible assets related to our l s operating segment 
in  we incurred million in restructuring and other expenses related to our headcount reduction  headquarters lease restructure  satellite office closures and asset impairments 
in november  we issued  shares of series b preferred stock as part of our acquisition of evolving systems uk based upon the various features of the series b preferred stock  the fair value of this security was estimated to approximate the stated redemption price 
since the conversion price of the series b preferred stock was fixed in the purchase agreement to equal per common share  a beneficial conversion feature existed on the acquisition date equal to the difference between the value of our common stock on the acquisition date  or  and the conversion price stated in the purchase agreement 
the beneficial conversion feature was recognized as a reduction in net income available to common stockholders of million on the acquisition date since the series b preferred stock was immediately convertible to common stock 
the decrease in working capital during was a result of our acquisition of two companies  tse and evolving systems uk  during the fourth quarter of in those transactions we paid cash of million and million for tse and evolving systems uk  respectively 
the tse transaction also included a short term note payable of approximately  the acquisition of evolving systems uk also included the issuance of seller financed notes of approximately million  including a short term note of million and a long term note of approximately million 
the purchase price related to these two acquisitions  including estimated transaction costs of million  reduced our working capital by approximately million

the following discussion should be read in conjunction with  and is qualified in its entirety by  the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth in this section and in item a risk factors 
overview we are a provider of software solutions and services to the wireless  wireline and ip carrier market 
we maintain long standing relationships with many of the largest wireline  wireless and ip communications carriers worldwide 
our customers rely on us to develop  deploy  enhance  maintain and integrate complex  highly reliable software solutions for a range of operations support systems oss 
our activation solution is the leading packaged solution for activation in the wireless industry 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the prescribed accounting standards for software revenue recognition under generally accepted accounting principles 
as a result  our license fees and services revenues fluctuate from period to period as a result of the timing of revenue recognition on existing projects 
we acquired tse in october and evolving systems uk in november these acquisitions were accounted for as purchase business combinations is accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and their results of operations were combined with evolving systems from the acquisition date forward 
therefore  the results of operations for the year ended december  reflect the results of operations for tse and evolving systems uk from october and november  respectively  through december  implementation of sfas r effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective method 
prior to january   we applied the intrinsic value based method in accounting for employee stock based compensation arrangements and the fair value method only for disclosure purposes 
under these methods  stock based compensation costs were not recorded in the financial statements but were disclosed in the notes to the financial statements together with pro forma disclosure of earnings and earnings per share based upon the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
because the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r require recognition of stock based compensation expense in the financial statements  the application of sfas r negatively impacted our results of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of stock based compensation expense associated with our stock option and employee stock purchase plans which were allocated to the various expense line items within our statements of operations 
as we previously applied the fair value method for disclosure purposes only  we believe the disclosures in previously issued reports are reasonably comparable to current period recorded expenses except for the requirement to now estimate forfeitures in the amount of compensation expense recognized  as compared to recording forfeitures as they occurred in our prior period pro forma disclosures 
as of december   there were million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to unvested stock options 
these costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
the following table summarizes the stock based compensation expenses recorded in the statements of operations in thousands 
for the year ended december  cost of license fee and services  excluding depreciation and amortization cost of customer support  excluding depreciation and amortization sales and marketing general and administrative product development impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of million at june  related to our license fees and services operating segment 
the impairment resulted from the decline in the fair value of goodwill initially recorded associated with our acquisitions of evolving systems uk  tse and cms 
in addition  we recorded an impairment of intangible assets of million at june  related to intangible assets acquired in the acquisitions of evolving systems uk  cms and tse 
an evaluation of product strategy and development plans resulted in the determination that the undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets would not be sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of these assets 
this non cash impairment charge resulted in acceleration of future amortization expense associated with these assets 
cost reductions during  we implemented a number of cost reducing strategies targeted at integrating our acquisitions  including identification of several duplicative roles that were eliminated following these acquisitions 
in july  we undertook cost reduction measures that involved an additional reduction in our workforce  including individuals at all levels of our us and us operations 
we recorded severance costs of  during related to these cost reductions 
in addition  we transitioned evolving systems uk third party software development to our offshore development team in our india subsidiary 
we have continued to increase utilization of our evolving systems india subsidiary which now employs approximately people 
net of the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets  our costs of revenue and operating expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  these cost reduction measures account for a significant portion of the decrease in our costs of revenue and operating expenses for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  our intangible amortization decreased million over these periods as certain of our intangible assets from our acquisitions became fully amortized and or were written down as a result of impairment at june  stock based compensation costs of million resulting from the implementation of sfas r partially offset these decreases in expense

license fees and services revenue represent the fees we receive from the licensing of our software products and those services directly related to the delivery of the licensed product as well as integration services and time and materials work 
customer support revenue includes annual support fees  recurring maintenance fees  minor product upgrades and warranty fees 
warranty fees are typically bundled with a license sale and the related revenue  based on vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  is deferred and recognized ratably over the warranty period 
the following table presents our revenue by product line in thousands 
for the years ended december  activation numbering solutions mediation license fees and services license fees and services revenue decreased or million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decline was a result of a decrease of million in revenue from our activation products and a decrease of million in revenue from our numbering solutions products 
the decline in activation products revenue was due to fewer license sales resulting from industry consolidation  competitive pressures and longer customer purchasing cycles 
the decline in numbering solutions license fees and services revenue was due to the maturity of the narrowband numbering solutions market in the us license fees and services revenue increased or million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was due to activation sales related to products acquired in the evolving systems uk acquisition  which was offset by lower revenues from our numbering solutions products 
the decline in numbering solutions license fees and services was due to industry consolidation and smaller overall license sales  which is reflective of the maturity of the narrowband numbering solutions market in the us customer support customer support revenues decreased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in customer support revenue included a decrease of million in our activation products  a decrease of million from our numbering solutions products and a decrease of million in our mediation products 
the decrease in activation revenue is a result of pricing pressures on support contract renewals 
the decrease in the numbering solutions revenue was due to industry consolidation and smaller overall license sales  which is reflective of the maturity of the narrowband numbering solutions market in the us the decline in mediation revenue is consistent with our focus on our activation and numbering solutions products 
customer support revenues increased or million to million for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase is due to increased revenue from the support of activation products acquired in the evolving systems uk acquisition  which is partially offset by lower revenue from the numbering solutions products 
industry consolidation and price reductions for mature and stable products accounted for the decline in numbering solutions customer support revenue during costs of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization costs of revenue consist primarily of personnel costs  facilities costs  the costs of third party software and all other direct costs associated with these personnel 
costs of revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
costs of license fees and services  excluding depreciation and amortization costs of revenue for license fees and services decreased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to decreased revenue as well as cost savings from our cost saving initiatives 
as a percentage of license fees and services revenue  costs of license fees and services  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease was due to cost savings as well as savings from the increased utilization of our offshore development subsidiary in bangalore  india 
costs of revenue for license fees and services increased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher employee related costs to support the increased volume of license and services projects as a result of the evolving systems uk acquisition  as well as additional costs associated with maintaining international offices 
this increase was offset by savings generated from our continued investment in our offshore development in bangalore  india 
cost of license fees and services were of license fees and services revenue for the year ended december  as compared to for the year ended december  this reduction of cost as a percentage of revenue was a result of the cost reductions implemented during which are discussed above as well as lower costs resulting from the increased utilization of our bangalore offshore development subsidiary 
costs of customer support  excluding depreciation and amortization costs of revenue for customer support decreased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to reduced revenue as well as cost savings 
as a percentage of customer support revenue  costs of customer support revenue  excluding depreciation and amortization  decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to cost reductions as well as savings from the increased utilization of our offshore development subsidiary in bangalore  india 
costs of revenue for customer support decreased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease results from savings realized from higher utilization of our offshore development team in india  partially offset by higher employee related cost to support more products as a result of our acquisitions of tse and evolving systems uk costs of customer support were of customer support revenue for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this decrease was the result of the cost reductions implemented during which are discussed above 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of compensation costs including bonuses and commissions  other employee related costs  travel expenses  advertising and occupancy expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost saving measures targeted at reducing the number of us sales personnel were somewhat offset by sales and marketing investments made in asia and central and latin america as well as stock based compensation expenses recorded during the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue  sales and marketing expenses for the year ended december  and  increased to from  respectively 
this increase was a result of decreased revenue without proportional decreases in sales and marketing expenses during the year ended december  as compared to the same period in sales and marketing expenses increased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to in compared to in these increases were primarily a result of additional costs associated with having an international sales force  increased expenses related to expanded headcount for sales initiatives designed to penetrate new markets and higher advertising and marketing costs to introduce the combined company s products and offerings into new regional markets 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist principally of employee related costs  professional fees and occupancy costs for the following departments facilities  finance  legal  human resources and executive management 
general and administrative expenses decreased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  and  decreased to from  respectively 
these decreases were primarily a result of cost saving measures and reductions in professional and legal fees which were offset by stock based compensation costs recorded during the year ended december  as part of the reduction in professional fees  we did not incur any professional fees during for compliance efforts related to the sarbanes oxley act 
under the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  we will be required to provide a report by management assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting for the year ended december  we expect this will result in an increase in professional fees during and subsequent years 
general and administrative expenses increased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to additional costs from evolving systems uk in addition  we incurred increased expenses related to audit and tax services as a result of being a larger  international company as well as increased professional services in the us related to initiating the documentation of internal controls that will be required under the sarbanes oxley act 
as a percentage of total revenue  general and administrative expenses declined to in from in this decline is attributable to the cost reductions implemented during which are discussed above

depreciation expenses decreased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease is a result of certain assets becoming fully depreciated 
depreciation expenses increased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was directly attributable to depreciation of property and equipment acquired in the tse and evolving systems uk acquisitions 
amortization amortization expense consists of amortization of identifiable intangibles related to our acquisitions of cms  tse and evolving systems uk amortization expenses decreased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized as well as the impairment of certain intangible assets during amortization expenses increased or million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was directly attributable to amortization of intangible assets acquired in the cms  tse and evolving systems uk acquisitions as there was only approximately two months of amortization expenses in related to the tse and evolving systems uk acquisitions 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets we recorded a goodwill impairment of million related to impairment of our license fees and services operating segment during continued pricing pressures and consolidation in the telecommunications industry negatively impacted our achievement of forecasted revenues associated with the acquisitions of cms in november  tse in october and evolving systems uk in november the market price of our common stock declined as a result of our operating results 
based upon these events  we determined that a triggering event had occurred and we conducted a goodwill impairment analysis as of june  this goodwill impairment analysis resulted in the million goodwill impairment charge 
we estimated the fair value of each reporting unit using the expected present value of future cash flows and other market factors 
as a result of the events that led to a triggering event related to the goodwill impairment  we first reviewed intangible assets in accordance with sfas an evaluation of product strategy and development plans resulted in the determination that the undiscounted cash flows associated with these assets would not be sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of these assets 
this review indicated that million of intangible assets related to our license fees and services and customer support operating segments were impaired 
the impaired intangible assets were purchased software  purchased licenses and customer relationships which were acquired through our acquisitions of evolving systems uk  cms and tse 
as a result of the impairment of intangible assets  our future amortization expense will be lower than originally projected by the amount of the million impairment charge 
interest income interest income includes interest income earned on cash and cash equivalents 
interest income for the year ended december  increased  as compared to the year ended december  as a result of higher cash and cash equivalents balances 
interest income for the year ended december  decreased or million to million as compared to the year ended december  as a result of lower balances of cash and cash equivalents 
interest expense interest expense includes interest expense on our long term debt and capital lease obligations as well as amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million to million as compared to million for the year ended december  this increase was a result of higher variable interest rates on our senior debt obligations and increased amortization of debt issuance costs 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased million to million as compared to the year ended december  as a result of the debt incurred in connection with the acquisitions of tse and evolving systems uk gain loss on foreign exchange transactions gain loss on foreign exchange transactions consists primarily of realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses result from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the respective subsidiary 
foreign currency transaction loss decreased million to  for the year ended december  compared to million the year ended december  these losses were primarily generated by evolving systems uk transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional currency 
gain loss on foreign exchange transactions decreased million to a million loss for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to realized foreign currency transaction losses of million during compared to realized transaction gains of million during these gains and losses were primarily generated by evolving systems uk transactions denominated in currencies other than its functional currency 
income tax benefit we recorded net income tax benefit of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
the us has net operating loss carryforwards of million which are used to offset any us tax liability 
our tax expense or benefit relate to our u 
k based subsidiary 
the net income tax benefit for the year ended december  of million related primarily to our uk based operations and consisted of current income tax expense of million and a deferred tax benefit of million 
during  we recorded a  current tax benefit for research and development expenses related to a change in estimate based on our as filed tax return for evolving systems uk the deferred tax benefit of million relates primarily to amortization expense on intangible assets 
the net income tax benefit for the year ended december  of million related primarily to our uk based operations and consisted of current income tax expense of million and a deferred tax benefit of million 
the net income tax benefit for the year ended december  of million related primarily to our uk based operations and consisted of current income tax expense of million and a deferred tax benefit of million 
in conjunction with the acquisition of evolving systems uk  certain identifiable intangible assets were recorded 
since the amortization of these identifiable intangibles is not deductible for income tax purposes  a long term deferred tax liability of million was established at the acquisition date for the expected difference between what would be expensed for financial reporting purposes and what would be deductible for income tax purposes 
as of december  and  this deferred tax liability was million and million  respectively 
the deferred tax liability relates to evolving systems uk and has no impact on our ability to recover the uk based deferred tax assets 
this deferred tax liability will be recognized as the identifiable intangibles are amortized 
we made an adjustment during the year ended december  as we determined that we had incorrectly recorded the purchase accounting entries related to our purchase of evolving systems uk during the year ended december  which had the effect of overstating goodwill by  and overstating the net deferred foreign income tax liability by  on the consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  the reported net income in should have been  higher 
we corrected this error at december  we assessed the impact on the and consolidated financial statements and determined that the impact was not material to either period 
a full valuation allowance was recorded against our us net deferred tax assets as of december  and as we determined that it was more likely than not that we will not realize our us deferred tax assets 
such assets primarily consist of certain net operating loss carryforwards 
our assessment of the realizability of our domestic deferred tax assets was made using all available evidence 
in particular  we considered both historical results and projections of profitability for only the reasonably foreseeable future periods and any tax planning strategies 
deemed dividend for beneficial conversion of series b preferred stock based upon the various features of the series b preferred stock  fair value of this security was determined to approximate the stated redemption price 
since the conversion price of the series b preferred stock was fixed in the purchase agreement to equal per common share  a beneficial conversion feature existed on the acquisition date equal to the difference between the value of our common stock on the acquisition date  or  and the conversion price stated in the purchase agreement 
for the year ended december   the beneficial conversion feature was recognized as a reduction of net income available to common stockholders of million on the acquisition date since the series b preferred stock was immediately convertible to common stock 
financial condition our working capital position of million at december  reflects an increase of million from our working capital position of million december  our working capital position increased despite a million prepayment on our senior note payable and a million increase in the current portion of long term debt  in accordance with the repayment schedule associated with our senior note payable 
the million prepayment resulted from the amendment of our senior debt agreements at june  liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed operations through a combination of cash flow from operations and equity transactions 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was million in cash and cash equivalents and million of unused availability under a revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is available through november net cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
net income loss plus non cash operating adjustments was million for  million for and million for changes in operating assets and liabilities reflected a net increase in cash from operating activities in of million and a decrease of million in from these fluctuations were primarily attributable to the timing of billings and collections for existing projects which vary based upon the specific billing schedules in each contract and affect the reported amounts of contract receivables  unbilled work in process and unearned revenue 
net cash used by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  we purchased million in property and equipment to support operations and paid additional cash consideration to the tse sellers of approximately million 
during  we purchased million in property and equipment to support operations  paid additional cash consideration to the tse sellers of approximately million  including million which was accrued as of december   and received million in settlement of pre acquisition contingencies from the evolving uk acquisition 
cash used in for investing activities consisted of million in property and equipment purchases and million associated with the purchase of tse and evolving systems uk net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  the net cash used during of million included million in principal payments on our senior debt facility 
during  we paid million toward reduction of our obligations incurred in connection with the tse and evolving systems uk acquisitions which included a debt restructuring prepayment of million to the evolving systems uk sellers 
this prepayment was funded through proceeds obtained from an million senior note payable that matures in november we restructured the remaining million in debt obligations to the evolving systems uk sellers 
the addition of the senior note payable and restructuring of the evolving systems uk seller debt reduced our scheduled principal payments through december   from approximately million to million 
in addition  we obtained a million senior revolving credit facility in november which required a minimum draw down of million 
our capital expenditures over the last three years averaged million 
a financial covenant on our senior note payable prohibits capital expenditures in excess of million 
over the next twelve months  we expect our capital expenditure requirements will approximate million which will be used to support operations 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents  together with anticipated cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
in making this assessment  we considered the following our cash and cash equivalents balance at december  of million  the availability under our revolving credit facility of million at december   our demonstrated ability to generate positive operating cash flows  our backlog of approximately million  including million in license fees and services and million in customer support at december   our planned capital expenditures  and our cash forecast which indicates that we will have sufficient liquidity to cover anticipated operating costs as well as debt service payments 
we are exposed to foreign currency rate risks which impact the carrying amount of our foreign subsidiaries and our consolidated equity  as well as our consolidated cash position due to translation adjustments 
for the year ended december   the effect of exchange rate changes resulted in a million increase to consolidated cash 
for the year ended december   the effect of exchange rate changes resulted in a million reduction of consolidated cash 
during the year ended december   the effect of exchange rate changes resulted in a million increase to consolidated cash 
we do not currently hedge our foreign currency exposure  but we intend to monitor the rate changes and may hedge our exposures if we see significant negative trends in exchange rates 
on june   we amended our minimum trailing twelve months ebitda and fixed charge coverage ratio covenants related to our senior credit facility 
as part of this amendment  we made a prepayment of principal on our senior note payable in the amount of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the covenant amendments 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december   which are comprised of a capital lease  operating leases and principal and interest payments on our long term debt  assuming no prepayments are made in thousands 
payments due by period total and thereafter long term debt interest on debt capital lease operating leases total commitments interest on debt represents cash interest payment obligations assuming all indebtedness at december  will be paid in accordance with its contractual terms and maturity and assumes interest rates on variable interest debt as of december  will remain unchanged in future periods 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require significant judgment or use of complex estimates 
revenue recognition we derive revenue from two primary sources license fees services and customer support 
we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended and interpreted by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions 
in addition we have applied staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition  which provides further interpretive guidance for public companies on the recognition  presentation and disclosure of revenue in financial statements 
the majority of our license fees and services revenue is generated from fixed price contracts which provide for licenses to our software products and services 
generally  when the services are determined to be essential to the functionality of the delivered software  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting  in accordance with sop and sop  accounting for long term construction type contracts 
the percentage of completion for each contract is estimated based on the ratio of direct labor hours incurred to total estimated direct labor hours 
since estimated direct labor hours and project costs  and changes thereto  can have a significant impact on revenue recognition  these estimates are critical and are reviewed by management regularly 
amounts billed in advance of services being performed are recorded as unearned revenue 
unbilled work in progress represents revenue earned but not yet billable under the terms of the fixed price contracts 
all such amounts are expected to be billed and collected within months 
we may encounter budget and schedule overruns on fixed price contracts caused by increased labor  overhead or material costs 
adjustments to cost estimates are made in the periods in which the facts requiring such revisions become known 
estimated losses  if any  are recorded in the period in which current estimates of total contract revenue and contract costs indicate a loss 
in arrangements where the services are not essential to the functionality of the delivered software  we recognize license revenue when a license agreement has been signed  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
where applicable  fees from multiple element arrangements are unbundled and recorded as revenue as the elements are delivered to the extent that vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value of the undelivered elements exist 
if vsoe for the undelivered elements does not exist  fees from such arrangements are deferred until the earlier of the date that vsoe does exist on the undelivered elements or all of the elements have been delivered 
services revenue provided under fixed price contracts is generally recognized using the percentage of completion method described above 
revenue from professional services provided pursuant to time and materials contracts and training services are recognized as the services are performed  as that is when our obligation to our customers under such arrangements is fulfilled 
customer support and maintenance revenue is generally recognized ratably over the service contract period 
when maintenance or training services are bundled with the original license fee arrangement  their fair value  based upon vsoe  is deferred and recognized during the periods such services are provided 
allowance for doubtful accounts we make judgments related to our ability to collect outstanding accounts receivable 
we provide allowances for receivables when their collection becomes doubtful by recording an expense 
generally  we determine the allowance based on our assessment of the realization of receivables using historical information and current economic trends  including assessing the probability of collection from customers 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments owed to us  an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts would be required 
we evaluate the adequacy of the allowance regularly and make adjustments accordingly 
adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts could materially affect our results of operations 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes 
we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we establish a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income projections  historical results and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
however  adjustments could be required in the future if we determine that the amount to be realized is less or greater than the amount that we recorded 
such adjustments  if any  could have a material impact on our results of our operations 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of acquisition cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized  but tested for impairment annually or whenever indicators of impairment exist 
these indicators may include a significant change in the business climate  legal factors  operating performance indicators  competition  sale or disposition of a significant portion of the business or other factors 
for purposes of the goodwill evaluation  we compare the fair value of each of our reporting units to its respective carrying amount 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit were to exceed its fair value  we would then compare the fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying amount  and any excess of the carrying amount over the fair value would be charged to operations as an impairment loss 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment of goodwill 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
intangible assets we allocate the cost of an acquired company to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities acquired  with the remaining amount being recorded as goodwill 
certain intangible assets are amortized over their estimated lives  while in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge to product development expense in the statements of operations on the acquisition date 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangibles if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
factors that we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy of the overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and or our market capitalization relative to net book value 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and or long lived assets may not be recoverable based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on the estimated discounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition and compare that to the asset s carrying amount 
any impairment loss recognized would represent the excess of the asset s carrying value over its estimated fair value 
significant estimates and judgments are required when estimating such fair values 
if it is determined that the intangibles are impaired  an impairment charge would be recorded and the amount could be material 
we recorded an impairment of intangible assets during the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
capitalization of internal software development costs we expend amounts on research and development r d  particularly for new products and or for enhancements of existing products 
for internal development of software products that are to be licensed by us  we follow statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed sfas 
sfas requires that the cost of developing software be expensed prior to establishing technological feasibility  and those costs be capitalized once technological feasibility has been established 
capitalization ceases upon general release of the software 
the determination of whether internal software r d costs are subject to capitalization is  by its nature  highly subjective and involves significant judgments 
this decision could significantly affect earnings during the development period 
further  once capitalized  the software costs are generally amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the product 
the determination of the expected useful life of a product is highly judgmental 
finally  capitalized software costs must be assessed for impairment if facts and circumstances warrant such a review 
we did not capitalize any internal software r d costs during the years ended december    or in addition  we did not have any capitalized internal software r d costs included in our december  and consolidated balance sheets 
we believe that during these periods no material internal software r d costs were required to be capitalized 
our conclusion is primarily based on the fact that the feature rich  pre integrated  and highly scalable nature of our products requires that our development efforts include complex design  coding and testing methodologies  which include next generation software languages and development tools 
development projects of this nature carry a high degree of development risk 
substantially all of our internal software r d efforts are of this nature  and therefore  we believe the period between achieving technological feasibility and the general release of the software to operations is so short that any costs incurred during this period are not material

 accounting for stock issued to employees 
under the modified prospective method of adoption  we are required to apply a fair value based measurement method in accounting for share based payment transactions with employees and record compensation cost for all stock awards granted after january  and awards modified  repurchased  or cancelled after that date 
in addition  we are required to record compensation costs associated with the vesting of unvested options outstanding at january  using the guidance under sfas from january   stock option grants and employee stock purchase plan purchases were accounted for under sfas r 
we use the black scholes model to estimate the fair value of each option grant on the date of grant 
this model requires the use of estimates for expected term of the options and expected volatility of the price of our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of business  we are exposed to certain market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
uncertainties that are either non financial or non quantifiable such as political  economic  tax  other regulatory  or credit risks are not included in the following assessment of market risks 
our cash balances are subject to interest rate fluctuations and as a result  interest income amounts may fluctuate from current levels 
we are exposed to interest rate risk related to our senior secured term note and senior revolving credit facility entered into in november these obligations are variable interest rate notes based on short term libor 
fluctuations in libor affect our interest rate risk 
assuming no change in the amounts outstanding  a hypothetical increase in our existing variable interest rates would increase our annual interest expense by approximately million 
we are exposed to fluctuations of the us dollar our functional currency against the currencies of our operating subsidiaries 
any increase decrease in the value of the us dollar against any foreign currency that is the functional currency of one of our operating subsidiaries will cause the parent company to experience unrealized foreign currency translation losses gains with respect to amounts already invested in such foreign currencies 
in addition  we and our operating subsidiaries are exposed to foreign currency risk to the extent that we enter into transactions denominated in currencies other than our respective functional currencies  such as revenues and related accounts receivable including intercompany amounts that are denominated in a currency other than their own functional currency 
changes in exchange rates with respect to these items will result in unrealized based upon period end exchange rates or realized foreign currency transaction gains and losses upon settlement of the transactions 
in addition  we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations related to our operating subsidiaries monetary assets and liabilities and the financial results of foreign subsidiaries and affiliates when their respective financial statements are translated into us dollars for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
cumulative translation adjustments are recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss as a separate component of equity 
as a result of foreign currency risk  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity with respect to our holdings solely as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the relationship between the great british pound  indian rupee and the us dollar  which is our functional currency  is shown below  per one us dollar december  spot rates great british pound indian rupee for the years ended december  average rates great british pound indian rupee at the present time  we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure or use derivative financial instruments that are designed to reduce our long term exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
to the extent that translation and transaction gain and losses become significant  we will consider various options to reduce this risk
